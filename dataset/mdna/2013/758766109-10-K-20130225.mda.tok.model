item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows of regal entertainment group for the fiscal years ended december   december   and december  the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of regal and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview and basis of presentation we conduct our operations through our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we operate the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuit in the united states  consisting of  screens in theatres in states and the district of columbia as of december  we believe the size  reach and quality of our theatre circuit provide an exceptional platform to realize economies of scale from our theatre operations 
we also maintain an investment in national cinemedia  which concentrates on in theatre advertising 
the company manages its business under one reportable segment theatre exhibition operations 
we generate revenues primarily from admissions and concession sales 
additional revenues are generated by our vendor marketing programs  our gift card and discount ticket programs  various other activities in our theatres and theatre access fees paid by national cinemedia net of payments for onscreen advertising time provided to our beverage concessionaire 
film rental costs depend primarily on the popularity and box office revenues of a film  and such film rental costs generally increase as the admissions revenues generated by a film increase 
because we purchase certain concession items  such as fountain drinks and popcorn  in bulk and not pre packaged for individual servings  we are able to improve our margins by negotiating volume discounts 
other operating expenses consist primarily of theatre labor and occupancy costs 
the company revenues are usually seasonal  coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors 
generally  motion picture studios release the most marketable motion pictures during the summer and holiday seasons 
the unexpected emergence or continuance of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional pattern 
the timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on the company results of operations  and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for the next or any other fiscal quarter 
the seasonality of motion picture exhibition  however  has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year 
the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate and modify on an ongoing basis such estimates and assumptions  which include those related to film costs  property and equipment  goodwill  income taxes and purchase accounting as well as others discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ materially from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies are discussed elsewhere within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where such estimates  assumptions  and accounting policies affect our reported and expected results 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our related disclosures herein 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations and affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have applied the principles of purchase accounting when recording theatre acquisitions 
under current purchase accounting principles  we are required to use the acquisition method of accounting to estimate the fair 
table of contents value of all assets and liabilities  including i the acquired tangible and intangible assets  including property and equipment  ii the liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition including contingencies  and iii the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
because the estimates we make in purchase accounting can materially impact our future results of operations  for significant acquisitions  we have obtained assistance from third party valuation specialists in order to assist in our determination of fair value 
the company provides the assumptions to the third party valuation firms based on information available to us at the acquisition date  including both quantitative and qualitative information about the specified assets or liabilities 
the company primarily utilizes the third parties to accumulate comparative data from multiple sources and assemble a report that summarizes the information obtained 
the company then uses the information to determine fair value 
the third party valuation firms are supervised by company personnel who are knowledgeable about valuations and fair value 
the company evaluates the appropriateness of the valuation methodology utilized by the third party valuation firm 
the estimation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities involves a number of judgments and estimates that could differ materially from the actual amounts 
historically  the estimates made have not experienced significant changes and  as a result  we have not disclosed such changes 
fasb accounting standards codification asc subtopic  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill specifies that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be subject to an annual impairment assessment 
based on our annual impairment assessment conducted during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we were not required to record a charge for goodwill impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of the goodwill  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
we estimate our film cost expense and related film cost payable based on management best estimate of the expected box office revenue of each film over the length of its run in our theatres and the ultimate settlement of such film costs with the distributors 
generally  less than one third of our quarterly film expense is estimated at period end 
the length of time until these costs are known with certainty depends on the ultimate duration of the film play  but is typically settled within two to three months of a particular film opening release 
upon settlement with our film distributors  film cost expense and the related film cost payable are adjusted to the final film settlement 
the ultimate revenues of a film can be estimated reasonably accurately within a few weeks after the film is released based on the film initial box office receipts 
as a result  there are typically insignificant variances between our estimates of film cost expense and the final film cost payable  because we make such estimates based on each film box office receipts through the end of the reporting period 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   there were no significant changes in our film cost estimation and settlement procedures 
we depreciate and amortize the components of our property and equipment relating to both owned and leased theatres on a straight line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
each owned theatre consists of a building structure  structural improvements  seating and concession and film display equipment 
while we have assigned an estimated useful life of less than years to certain acquired facilities  we estimate that our newly constructed buildings generally have an average economic useful life of years 
certain of our buildings have been in existence for more than years 
with respect to equipment eg  concession stand  point of sale equipment  etc  a substantial portion is depreciated over seven years or less  which has been our historical replacement period 
seats and digital projection equipment generally have a longer useful economic life  and their depreciable lives years are based on our experience and replacement practices 
the estimates of the assets useful lives require our judgment and our knowledge of the assets being depreciated and amortized 
further  we review the economic useful lives of such assets annually and make adjustments thereto as necessary 
to the extent we determine that certain of our assets have become obsolescent  we accelerate depreciation over the remaining useful lives of the assets 
for example  in connection with our deployment of leased digital projection systems to theatres across our circuit  the company accelerated depreciation of its owned mm film projection equipment that was replaced with leased digital projection systems  with such depreciation occurring over the expected deployment schedule since the company disposed of such equipment prior to the end of its useful life 
to that end  during the fiscal years ended december  and december   the company recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of accelerated depreciation related to such mm film projection equipment 
actual economic lives may differ materially from these estimates 
historical appraisals of our properties have supported the estimated lives being used for depreciation and amortization purposes 
furthermore  our analysis of our historical capital replacement program is consistent with our depreciation policies 
finally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
such analysis generally evaluates assets for impairment on an individual theatre basis 
when the estimated future undiscounted 
table of contents cash flows of the operations to which the assets relate do not exceed the carrying value of the assets  such assets are written down to fair value 
our experience indicates that theatre properties become impaired primarily due to market or competitive factors rather than physical wear and tear or functional inadequacy or obsolescence factors 
in this regard  we do not believe the frequency or volume of facilities impaired due to these market factors are significant enough to impact the useful lives used for depreciation periods 
for the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   no significant changes have been made to the depreciation and amortization rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation and amortization  or the methodology applied 
for the fiscal year ended december   consolidated depreciation and amortization expense was million  representing of consolidated total revenues 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have decreased by approximately million  or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation and amortization expense would have increased by approximately million  or 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we reassess the need for such valuation allowance on an ongoing basis 
an increase in the valuation allowance generally results in an increase in the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
a decrease in the valuation allowance generally results in a decrease to the provision for income taxes recorded in such period 
additionally  income tax rules and regulations are subject to interpretation  require judgment by us and may be challenged by the taxing authorities 
as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  income taxes overview 
although we believe that our tax return positions are fully supportable  in accordance with asc subtopic  we recognize a tax benefit only for tax positions that we determine will more likely than not be sustained based on the technical merits of the tax position 
with respect to such tax positions for which recognition of a benefit is appropriate  the benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions are evaluated on an ongoing basis as part of our process for determining our provision for income taxes 
among other items deemed relevant by us  the evaluations are based on new legislation  other new technical guidance  judicial proceedings  and our specific circumstances  including the progress of tax audits 
any change in the determination of the amount of tax benefit recognized relative to an uncertain tax position impacts the provision for income taxes in the period that such determination is made 
for fiscal  our provision for income taxes was million 
changes in management estimates and assumptions regarding the probability that certain tax return positions will be sustained  the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could impact the provision for income taxes and change the effective tax rate 
a one percentage point change in the effective tax rate from to would have increased the current year income tax provision by approximately million 
significant events and fiscal outlook during the fiscal years ended december  fiscal period  december  fiscal period  and december  fiscal period  the company entered into various financing transactions which are more fully described under liquidity and capital resources financing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
as discussed further under liquidity and capital resources investing activities below and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  during the fiscal period  we completed the acquisition of great escape theatres in which we acquired a total of theatres representing screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of approximately million 
subsequent to the conclusion of the fiscal period  a post closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price resulted in a million increase in the net cash purchase price to approximately million 
the acquisition of the great escape circuit enhanced 
table of contents our presence in georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  missouri  nebraska  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee and west virginia 
during the fiscal period  we continued to make progress with respect to the following strategic initiatives we demonstrated our commitment to providing incremental value to our stockholders 
during fiscal  we paid to our stockholders four quarterly cash dividends of per share  or approximately million in the aggregate 
in addition  on december   we paid an extraordinary cash dividend of per share  or approximately million 
we opened eight new theatres with screens  acquired great escape theatres consisting of theatres and screens  and closed underperforming theatres with screens  ending the fiscal period with theatres and  screens 
we continued to embrace innovative concepts to deliver a premium movie going experience for our customers on three complementary fronts we believe the installation of premium screens allows us to offer our patrons all digital large format experiences that generate incremental revenue and cash flows for the company 
our imax footprint consisted of a total of imax screens as of december  we believe that expanding our imax presence will continue to have a positive impact on our operating results and to that end  we have recently agreed to install an additional ten imax digital projection systems  which will ultimately expand our imax footprint to imax screens 
we expect that our imax footprint will consist of between to auditoriums by the end of and we intend to install the remaining imax digital projection systems during and beyond 
during the fiscal period  we added our proprietary large screen format known as regal premium experience rpx sm to auditoriums  bringing our total to rpx sm screens as of december  we have been encouraged by the results of our rpx sm screens and expect to increase our rpx sm footprint to approximately auditoriums by the end of as of december   we operated a total of  digital d capable projection systems approximately of our total screens 
we are pleased with the benefits of our premium screen formats primarily as it relates to imax and d film product and other d content and with the continued support of imax and d film product by the major motion picture studios 
second  we believe that the enhancement of our food and beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results and we expect to continue to invest in such food and beverage offerings in our theatres 
to continually address consumer trends and customer preferences  we focused on enlarging our menu of food and beverage products 
we have already expanded our menu to include hot made to order meals  customizable coffee  beer and wine and other specialty products in select theatres 
during the fiscal period  we offered expanded food items in theatres and expect to offer these food items in approximately additional theatres during fiscal in addition  as of december   we have successfully launched six cinebarre locations which offer patrons the convenience of a variety of lunch and dinner menu options  including beer and wine  served at the customer seat before and during the featured film 
third  we intend to continue our focus on interactive marketing programs aimed at increasing attendance and enhancing the overall customer experience 
for example  we maintain a frequent moviegoer loyalty program  named the regal crown club  to actively engage our core customers 
regal crown club members are eligible for specified awards  such as concession items  based on purchases made at our participating theatres 
as of december   we had nearly seven million active members in the regal crown club  making it the largest loyalty program in our industry 
in addition  we seek to develop patron loyalty through a number of other marketing programs  such as selective discounting of ticket and concession prices in certain markets  summer children film series  cross promotional ticket redemptions and promotions within local communities 
in addition  during the fiscal period  we launched a new mobile application designed to give customers quick access to box office information via their apple iphone or android phone 
the application provides customers the ability to find films  movie information  showtimes  special offers from regal and purchase tickets for local theatres  thereby expediting the admissions process 
additionally  the application will help customers stay up to date on the latest coupons and regal crown club loyalty program promotions 
finally  we believe that open road films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theatres and generate a return on our capital investment 
open road films distributed a total of six films during the fiscal period and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year 
as of december   our cumulative cash investment in open 
table of contents road films totaled million 
we believe our investment in open road films will generate incremental value for our stockholders 
we are optimistic regarding the breadth of the film slate  including the timing of the release schedule and the number of films scheduled for release in premium priced formats 
evidenced by the motion picture studios continued efforts to promote and market upcoming film releases  appears to be another year of high profile releases such as a good day to die hard  oz the great and powerful  the croods  gi joe retaliation  oblivion  iron man  the great gatsby  star trek into darkness  fast furious  after earth  man of steel  monsters university  world war z  the heat  despicable me  pacific rim  the wolverine  rise of an empire  ender game  thor the dark world  the hunger games catching fire  the hobbit the desolation of smaug and anchorman the legend continues 
we intend to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and through accretive acquisitions 
with respect to capital expenditures  subject to the timing of certain construction projects  we expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales to be in the range of million to million for fiscal  consisting of new theatre development  expansion of existing theatre facilities  upgrades and replacements 
overall for the fiscal year  we expect to benefit from modest increases in ticket prices and average concessions per patron 
in addition  we expect fiscal admissions and concessions revenues to be supported by our continued focus on efficient theatre operations and through opportunities to expand our concession offerings 
we will continue to maintain a business strategy focused on the evaluation of accretive acquisition opportunities  selective upgrades and premium experience opportunities and providing incremental returns to our stockholders 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  the preceding and following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented in part ii  item of this form k

results of operations based on our review of industry sources  north american box office revenues for the time period that corresponds to the fiscal period were estimated to have increased by approximately six percent in comparison to the period of time that corresponds to the fiscal period 
the industry box office results were positively impacted by strong attendance generated by the commercial appeal of the overall fiscal film slate  including most notably  the avengers  the dark knight rises and the hunger games

fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues increased million  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period primarily due to a increase in average ticket price and a increase in attendance 
the primary driver of the increase in our fiscal period average ticket price was selective price increases identified during our ongoing periodic pricing reviews which include analysis of various factors such as general inflationary 
table of contents trends and local market conditions 
we believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the motion picture studios 
the fiscal period increase in attendance was primarily attributable to the commercial appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the fiscal period  including the avengers  the dark knight rises and the hunger games  as compared to the films exhibited during the fiscal period

concessions total concessions revenues increased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million for the fiscal period 
average concessions revenues per patron during the fiscal period increased  to  from for the fiscal period 
the increase in total concessions revenues during the fiscal period was attributable to the increase in average concessions revenues per patron  coupled with the aforementioned increase in attendance during the period

rent expense rent expense increased by million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the increase in rent expense during the fiscal period was primarily related to incremental rent associated with the opening of eight new theatres with screens subsequent to the end of the fiscal period  higher contingent rent associated with increased admissions and concessions revenues during the fiscal period  and to a lesser extent  incremental rent associated with the fiscal period acquisition of great escape theatres  partially offset by a reduction in rent associated with the closure of theatres with screens subsequent to the end of the fiscal period 
other operating expenses other operating expenses decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period

income from operations income from operations increased million  or  to million during the fiscal period  from million in the fiscal period 
the net increase in income from operations during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily attributable to an increase in total revenues  reductions in certain variable operating expense line items described above  and a lower net loss on disposal and impairment of operating assets and other 
interest expense  net during the fiscal period  net interest expense decreased million  or  to million  from million in the fiscal period 
the decrease in net interest expense during the fiscal period was principally due to a lower effective interest rate on our term facility including a change in our interest rate swap portfolio

the company received million and million  respectively  in cash distributions from national cinemedia including payments received of million and million  respectively  under the tax receivable agreement described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k during the fiscal period and fiscal period 
approximately million and million  respectively  of these cash distributions received during the fiscal period and the fiscal period were recognized as a reduction in our investment in national cinemedia 
the remaining amounts were recognized in equity income during each of these periods and have been included as a component of earnings recognized from ncm in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the provision for income taxes of million and million for the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively  reflect effective tax rates of approximately and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for the fiscal period is primarily attributable to changes in uncertain tax positions with state taxing authorities resulting from the lapse of statute of limitations and clarifications of tax law that occurred in the fiscal period  as well as decreases in federal hiring credits during the fiscal period as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k

fiscal period compared to fiscal period admissions during the fiscal period  total admissions revenues decreased million  or  to  million  from  million in the fiscal period primarily due to a decrease in attendance and a decrease in average ticket price 
we believe that our attendance is primarily dependent upon the commercial appeal of content released by the major motion picture studios 
the fiscal period decline in attendance was primarily attributable to a decline in the appeal to our patrons of the films exhibited in our theatres during the fiscal period as compared to the films exhibited during the fiscal period  which included the record breaking performance of avatar and strong attendance from other top tier releases such as toy story  alice in wonderland  iron man and inception 
the primary driver of the decrease in our fiscal period

during the eight quarters ended december   we recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million  million  million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively  specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition  adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further information related to our impairment policies 
during the quarter ended december   the company considered various factors pertaining to its investment in reald  inc as part of its ongoing impairment review and determined that an other than temporary impairment existed as of december  such determination was based primarily on the length approximately six months of time during which the fair value of the reald  inc investment remained substantially below the recorded investment cost basis of approximately per share  the severity of the decline during such period and the prospects of recovery of the investment to its original cost basis 
as a result  the company recorded a million other than temporary impairment charge to write down its cost basis in reald  inc  shares to fair value as of december  the fair value of reald  inc common shares was based on the publicly traded common stock price of reald  inc as of december  of per share 
liquidity and capital resources on a consolidated basis  we expect our primary uses of cash to be for operating expenses  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  general corporate purposes related to corporate operations  debt service and the company quarterly dividend payments 
the principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  cash on hand and borrowings under the amended senior credit facility described below 
under the terms of the amended senior credit facility and the senior notes issued during fiscal  regal cinemas is restricted as to how much it can advance or distribute to regal  its indirect parent 
since regal is a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries  this restriction could impact regal ability to effect future debt or dividend payments  pay corporate expenses  repurchase or retire for cash its senior notes and its senior notes 
in addition  as described further below  the indentures under which the senior notes and senior notes are issued limit the company and its restricted subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of its capital stock  purchase or redeem capital stock  make loans or advances to its subsidiaries  or purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire or retire certain subordinated obligations 
operating activities our revenues are generated principally through admissions and concessions sales with proceeds received in cash or via credit cards at the point of sale 
our operating expenses are primarily related to film and advertising costs  rent and occupancy  and payroll 
film costs are ordinarily paid to distributors within days following receipt of admissions revenues and the cost of the company concessions are generally paid to vendors approximately to days from purchase 
our current liabilities include items that will become due within months 
in addition  from time to time  we use cash from operations and borrowings to fund dividends in excess of net income attributable to controlling interest and cash flows from operating activities less cash flows from investing and other financing activities 
as a result  at any given time  our balance sheet may reflect a working capital deficit 
as further described note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  the company maintains an investment in national cinemedia  a pass through entity for federal income tax purposes 
the internal 
table of contents revenue service irs is currently examining national cinemedia and income tax returns and has proposed an adjustment related to agreements entered into in conjunction with ncm inc ipo 
management has evaluated the proposed adjustment and does not anticipate the adjustment would result in a material change to the company results of operations or financial position 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that an increase in unrecognized tax benefits related to this position may be necessary within the next twelve months  however the amount of such unrecognized tax benefits is not reasonably estimable as of december  net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the million decrease in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period increase was caused by negative fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately million  partially offset by a million increase in net income excluding non cash items 
working capital activity was primarily impacted by negative fluctuations in accounts payable activity primarily film rental liabilities and income taxes payable during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  partially offset by the impact of increased third party sales of our gift cards and discount tickets during the latter part of the negative fluctuation in accounts payable activity was primarily due to the timing of film and certain other vendor payments during the fiscal period 
the decrease in income taxes payable activity during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period was primarily associated with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments during such periods 
the million increase in net cash flows generated by operating activities for the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period increase was caused by a million increase in net income excluding non cash items coupled with a positive fluctuation in working capital activity of approximately million 
in the fiscal period  a million reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was the primary driver of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities by million 
the reduction in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily related to the timing of real estate tax and other lease related payments and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
in the fiscal period  a million increase in trade and other receivables and a million reduction in accounts payable were the primary components of working capital activity that negatively impacted cash flows from operating activities by million 
the increase in trade and other receivables during the fiscal period was primarily associated with increased third party sales of our gift cards and discount tickets during the latter part of and with the timing of our estimated federal and state income tax payments 
the decrease in accounts payable primarily film rental liabilities in the fiscal period was primarily due to lower attendance and box office revenue at our theaters during the latter part of the period coupled with the timing of certain film payments 
investing activities our capital requirements have historically arisen principally in connection with acquisitions of theatres  new theatre construction  strategic partnerships  adding new screens to existing theatres  upgrading the company theatre facilities and replacing equipment 
we fund the cost of capital expenditures through internally generated cash flows  cash on hand  proceeds from disposition of assets and financing activities 
we maintain an investment in dcip  a joint venture company formed by regal  amc and cinemark 
during the fiscal period  the company effected equity contributions of approximately million to dcip  and expects to make additional equity contributions in the future 
dcip s initial financing  coupled with a second round of financing completed in march which consisted of a new million term loan facility  has covered the cost of conversion to digital projection for our entire circuit 
dcip funds the cost of conversion to digital projection principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors  including us 
in accordance with the master equipment lease agreement the master lease  the digital projection systems are leased from kasima  llc under a twelve year term with ten one year fair value renewal options 
the master lease also contains a fair value purchase option 
under the master lease  the company pays annual minimum rent of  per digital projection system from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term and is  upon certain conditions described below  subject to incremental annual rent of  per digital projection system beginning at six and a half years from the effective date of the agreement through the end of the lease term 
in the event that the junior capital raised by dcip in the initial financing transactions remains outstanding at any time on or after the date that is six and a half years after the closing date of march  the holders of the related notes will have the right to require the company and other participating exhibitors to make incremental minimum rent payments of  per digital projection system per year through the earlier of the end of the lease term or until such notes are repaid 
the company considers both the  minimum rental and the incremental minimum rental payment of  per digital projection system to be minimum rents and accordingly has recorded such rents on a straight line basis in its consolidated financial statements 
the company is also subject to various types of other rent if such digital projection systems do not meet minimum performance requirements as outlined in the master lease 
certain of the other rent payments are subject to either a monthly or an annual maximum 
the company accounts for the master lease as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
during the fiscal period and the fiscal period  the company incurred total rent of approximately 
table of contents million and million  respectively  associated with the leased digital projection systems 
as of december   we operated  screens outfitted with digital projection systems 
we intend to continue to grow our theatre circuit through selective expansion and acquisition opportunities 
the company has a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital projects  with the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary non maintenance capital project being whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment meets or exceeds the company internal rate of return targets 
we currently expect capital expenditures net of proceeds from asset sales for theatre development  expansion  upgrading and replacements to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year  exclusive of acquisitions 
on november   regal completed the acquisition of great escape theatres  whereby it acquired a total of theatres representing screens for an aggregate net cash purchase price of million 
subsequent to the conclusion of the fiscal period  a post closing working capital adjustment to the purchase price resulted in a million increase in the net cash purchase price to approximately million 
the transaction involved multiple sellers and the aggregate purchase price included repayment of the sellers debt and the assumption of working capital 
the acquisition of the great escape theatres circuit enhanced regal presence in georgia  illinois  indiana  kentucky  missouri  nebraska  ohio  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee and west virginia 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for further discussion of this transaction 
as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  during the fiscal period  we received from national cinemedia approximately million newly issued common units of national cinemedia in accordance with the annual adjustment provisions of the common unit adjustment agreement 
this transaction caused a proportionate increase in the company additional investments tranche and increased our ownership share in national cinemedia to million common units 
as a result  on a fully diluted basis  we own a interest in ncm  inc as of december  during the fiscal period  we announced the creation of open road films 
we believe that open road films has a unique opportunity to fill a gap in the marketplace created by the major studios big budget franchise film strategy by marketing smaller budget films in a cost effective manner which we believe will drive additional patrons to our theaters and generate a return on our capital investment 
open road films distributed a total of six films during fiscal and expects to eventually distribute approximately eight to ten films per year 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in cash contributions in open road films and may invest an additional million in this joint venture 
net cash flows used in investing activities totaled approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period  as compared to the fiscal period  was primarily attributable to the impact of the million acquisition of great escape theatres during the fiscal period and a million increase in capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals during the fiscal period  partially offset by a million decrease in cash contributions to our various investments in non consolidated entities during the fiscal period 
the million increase in cash flows used in investing activities during the fiscal period  as compared to the fiscal period  was primarily attributable to the impact of net proceeds of approximately million related to the sale of ncm  inc common stock during the fiscal period  a million reduction in proceeds from the disposition of assets during the fiscal period and incremental cash contributions to our various investments in non consolidated entities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  partially offset by the impact of the million acquisition of eight amc theatres during the fiscal period  an million reduction in capital expenditures during the fiscal period and million in proceeds received in connection with a property insurance claim during the fiscal period

the company used the net proceeds to repay approximately million of the amended senior credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
as a result of this repayment  coupled with the execution of the refinancing agreement described 
table of contents below  the company recorded an aggregate loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the quarter ended march  on february   regal cinemas entered into the refinancing agreement the refinancing agreement with regal  the guarantors  credit suisse  and the lenders  which amends and refinances the term facility under the amended senior credit facility the term facility described further in note to the audited consolidated financial statements

in addition to extending the maturity date of the new term loans  the refinancing agreement also amends the amended senior credit facility by reducing the interest rate on the new term loans  by providing  at regal cinemas option  either a base rate or an adjusted libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin that is determined according to the consolidated leverage ratio of regal cinemas and its subsidiaries 
such applicable margin will be either or in the case of base rate loans and either or in the case of libor rate loans 
the refinancing agreement also amends the second amended and restated guaranty and collateral agreement  dated may   to exclude margin stock as defined therein from the grant of the security interest in the collateral as defined therein used to secure the obligations under the amended senior credit facility

as of december   we are in full compliance with all agreements  including all related covenants  governing our outstanding debt obligations 
the company is rated by nationally recognized rating agencies 
the significance of individual ratings varies from agency to agency 
however  companies assigned ratings at the top end of the range have  in the opinion of certain rating agencies  the strongest capacity for repayment of debt or payment of claims  while companies at the bottom end of the range have the weakest capability 
ratings are always subject to change and there can be no assurance that the company current ratings will continue for any given period of time 
an upgrade or downgrade of the company debt ratings  depending on the extent  could affect the cost to borrow funds 
there were no upgrades or downgrades to the company debt ratings that materially impacted our ability or cost to borrow funds during the fiscal year ended december  during the fiscal period  regal paid four quarterly cash dividends of per share on each outstanding share of the company class a and class b common stock  or approximately million in the aggregate 
in addition  on december   regal paid an extraordinary cash dividend of per share on each outstanding share of its class a and class b common stock  or approximately million 
on february   the company declared a cash dividend of per share on each share of the company class a and class b common stock including outstanding restricted stock  payable on march   to stockholders of record on march  these dividends have been or will be funded through cash flow from operations and available cash on hand 
we  at the discretion of the board of directors and subject to applicable law  anticipate paying regular quarterly dividends on our class a and class b common stock for the foreseeable future 
the amount  if any  of the dividends to be paid in the future will depend upon our then available cash  anticipated cash needs  overall financial condition  loan agreement restrictions  future prospects for earnings and cash flows  as well as other relevant factors 
net cash flows used in financing activities were approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the net increase in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period of million was primarily attributable to a the impact of receiving million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes in the fiscal period  a million increase in dividends paid to shareholders during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  partially offset by a decrease in net payments on long term debt obligations of million and the impact of million of cash used to redeem our convertible senior notes during the fiscal period 
the net decrease in cash flows used in financing activities during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period of million was primarily attributable to a million decrease in dividends paid to shareholders during the fiscal period as compared to the fiscal period  million less cash used to redeem the company remaining convertible senior notes  the impact of million cash used to redeem our senior subordinated notes during the fiscal

on june   we filed with the commission an automatic shelf registration statement for well known seasoned issuers on form s asr registration no 

this registration statement enables us to offer to sell  from time to time  debt securities  class a common stock  preferred stock  warrants  depositary shares  purchase contracts or units 
the shelf registration statement will also permit our subsidiary  regal cinemas  to offer to sell  from time to time  debt securities  that may be guaranteed by us 
pursuant to the rules governing automatic shelf registration statements  we will file a prospectus supplement and advise the commission of the amount and type of securities each time we issue or guarantee securities under this registration statement 
see recent developments above and note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k as of december  for information regarding securities issued under this automatic shelf registration statement subsequent to the year ended december  ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda was approximately million  million and million for the fiscal period  the fiscal period and the fiscal period  respectively 
the increase in ebitda in the fiscal period from the fiscal period was primarily attributable to an increase in operating income as described above  the impact of the fiscal period loss on debt extinguishment associated with the amended senior credit facility  incremental income from certain of the company equity method investments during the fiscal period and the impact of the impairment of our investment in reald  inc recorded in the fiscal period  partially offset by lower earnings recognized from national cinemedia during the fiscal period 
the company uses ebitda as a supplemental liquidity measure because we find it useful to understand and evaluate our capacity  excluding the impact of interest  taxes  and non cash depreciation and amortization charges  for servicing our debt  paying dividends and otherwise meeting our cash needs  prior to our consideration of the impacts of other potential sources and uses of cash  such as working capital items 
we believe that ebitda is useful to investors for these purposes as well 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net cash provided by or used in operating activities  as determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  since it omits the impact of interest  taxes and changes in working capital that use or provide cash such as receivables  payables and inventories as well as the sources or uses of cash associated with changes in other balance sheet items such as long term loss accruals and deferred items 
because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for the replacement of the assets being depreciated and amortized  which assets will often have to be replaced in the future 
further  ebitda  because it also does not reflect the impact of debt service  income taxes  cash dividends  capital expenditures and other cash commitments from time to time as described in more detail elsewhere in this form k  does not represent how much discretionary cash we have available for other purposes 
nonetheless  ebitda is a key measure expected by and useful to our fixed income investors  rating agencies and the banking community all of whom believe  and we concur  that these measures are critical to the capital markets analysis of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  pay dividends and otherwise meet cash needs  respectively 
we also evaluate ebitda because it is clear that movements in these non gaap measures impact our ability to attract financing and pay dividends 
ebitda  as calculated  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities is calculated as follows in millions fiscal period fiscal period fiscal period ebitda interest expense  net provision for income taxes deferred income taxes changes in operating assets and liabilities loss on extinguishment of debt gain on sale of ncm  inc common stock impairment of investment in reald  inc other items  net net cash provided by operating activities interest rate swaps as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  as of december   the company maintained one effective hedging relationship via one distinct interest rate swap agreement maturing june   which requires regal cinemas to pay interest at a fixed rate of and receive interest at a 
table of contents variable rate 
this interest rate swap agreement is designated to hedge million of variable rate debt obligations at an effective rate of approximately as of december  under the terms of the company s interest rate swap agreement as of december   regal cinemas receives interest at a variable rate based on the month libor 
the month libor rate on each reset date determines the variable portion of the interest rate swap for the following three month period 
the interest rate swap settles any accrued interest for cash on the last day of each calendar quarter  until expiration 
at such dates  the differences to be paid or received on the interest rate swap will be included in interest expense 
no premium or discount was incurred upon the company entering into the interest rate swap  because the pay and receive rates on the interest rate swap represented prevailing rates for the counterparty at the time the interest rate swap was entered into 
the interest rate swap qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting treatment and as such  the company has effectively hedged its exposure to variability in the future cash flows attributable to the month libor on million of variable rate obligations 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the interest rate swap s gains or losses reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss and the ineffective portion reported in earnings interest expense 
as interest expense is accrued on the debt obligation  amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income loss related to the designated hedging instrument the one effective interest rate swap will be reclassified into earnings to obtain a net cost on the debt obligation equal to the effective yield of the fixed rate of the swap
