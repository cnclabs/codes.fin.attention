as a result  certain disclosures and amounts are not on a basis comparable to other periods presented 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development and production of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
our principal domestic areas of operation include the mid continent  the rocky mountains and onshore gulf coast 
internationally  we focus on offshore oil developments in malaysia and china 
in february  we initiated a process to evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to our international businesses 
to maintain and grow our production and cash flows  we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new oil and natural gas reserves to replace those reserves being produced 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil  natural gas and ngls and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
prices for oil  natural gas and ngls fluctuate widely and affect the amount of cash flows available for capital expenditures  our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  and the quantity of oil  natural gas and ngls that we can economically produce 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
in addition  we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these assets  are capitalized 
the net capitalized costs for our oil and gas properties may not exceed the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves 
if these costs exceed the limit  we are required to charge the excess to earnings  also referred to as a ceiling test writedown 
as of december   the unamortized net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling amount by approximately billion million  after tax 
the risk of incurring a ceiling test writedown increases when commodity prices are low for a sustained period of time 
if there are further declines in sec pricing  we may be required to record a ceiling test writedown in future periods 
results of operations revenues 
our revenues are primarily derived from the sale of oil  natural gas and ngls and do not include the effects of the settlements of our derivative positions 
please see note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts 
our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in commodity prices or volumes of production sold 
in addition  substantially all of the crude oil from our offshore operations in malaysia and china is produced into fpsos or onshore storage terminals  and lifted and sold periodically as barge quantities are accumulated 
revenues are recorded when oil is lifted and sold  not when it is produced into the fpso 
as a result  the timing of liftings may impact period to period results 
during the year ended december   our revenues were up million  or  over and reflect our continued focus on increasing our liquids production and allowing our natural gas production to decline 
oil production was up in  and when combined with slightly higher prices  added an additional million compared to substantially offsetting the uplift in revenues from oil were lower gas prices and volumes that resulted in million less gas revenues in compared to increased ngl production of was more than offset by a decline in ngl prices during the year 
revenues of billion for were higher than for  approximately half of the increase in revenue was due to higher average realized oil prices and half of the increase resulted from increased oil production 
the following table reflects our production and average realized commodity prices for each of the years ended december production domestic crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas bcf ngls mbbls total bcfe international crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas bcf total bcfe total crude oil and condensate mbbls natural gas bcf ngls mbbls total bcfe average realized prices domestic crude oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf ngls per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe international crude oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas equivalent per mcfe total crude oil and condensate per bbl natural gas per mcf ngls per bbl natural gas equivalent per mcfe represents volumes lifted and sold regardless of when produced 
excludes natural gas produced and consumed in operations of bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in historically  we reported natural gas liquid ngl volumes combined with oil and condensate production 
effective in our form k for the period ended december   we began reporting ngl production separately from crude oil and condensate production 
as such  all production volumes and average realized prices for periods prior to have been reclassified for comparability between periods 
had we included the effects of hedging contracts not designated for hedge accounting  the average realized price for total natural gas would have been  and per mcf for the years ended december   and  respectively  and the average crude oil realized price would have been  and per bbl for  and  respectively 
we did not have any hedging contracts associated with ngl production in  or domestic production 
our domestic oil  natural gas and ngl production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  decreased compared to production 
the decrease relates primarily to the sale of assets in the gulf of mexico and natural declines in our natural gas assets due to lack of investment as our investments have been focused on oil and liquids projects 
our domestic oil and liquids production increased approximately in when compared to the prior year 
our domestic oil and gas production  stated on a natural gas equivalent basis  increased over production primarily due to increased production of in our rocky mountains and mid continent regions as a result of continued successful development drilling efforts  partially offset by production decreases in our onshore gulf coast region and gulf of mexico deepwater operations due to natural field decline and weather and equipment related delays 
international production 
our international oil production increased by over levels primarily due to an increase of in malaysia production resulting from continued successful drilling on our east belamut field  as well as full year production on our east piatu and puteri fields  brought online during the fourth quarter of our international oil production increased over levels primarily due to an increase in production of in malaysia as a result of new field developments from our east piatu and east belamut fields and the timing of liftings 
operating expenses 
year ended december  compared to december  the following table compares information about our operating expenses between the following periods unit of production total amount year ended december  percentage increase decrease year ended december  percentage increase decrease per mcfe in millions domestic lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test impairment n a  n a other n a n a total operating expenses international lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative total operating expenses total lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative ceiling test impairment n a  n a other n a n a total operating expenses domestic operations 
excluding the ceiling test writedown  the increase in our depletion rate due to price related downward reserve revisions and the impact of selling our offshore gulf of mexico assets  our operating expenses increased 
the components of the significant period to period change are as follows lease operating expenses loe include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our oil and gas wells  non recurring well workover and repair related expenses and the costs to transport our production to the applicable sales points 
recurring loe increased per mcfe to per mcfe 
the increase was due to higher compression  fuel  electricity  and rental equipment costs coupled with declining natural gas production in our mid continent region 
partially offsetting this increase was improved recurring loe per unit in our rocky mountain and onshore gulf coast regions 
increases in our non recurring loe of million accounted for of the increase in total domestic loe primarily due to the following increased workover activity was the primary factor resulting in a million increase in non recurring loe in our rocky mountain region  restimulation of several wells in our effort to improve performance was the leading driver of the million non recurring loe increase in our mid continent region  repairs to plugged flow lines in our deepwater gulf of mexico operations  which were subsequently sold in the fourth quarter of  was the primary driver of an additional increase of million in non recurring loe  and transportation costs related to firm transportation agreements in our mid continent region accounted for per mcfe of the increase 
our average depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a rate increased per mcfe during and reflects our continued focus on oil and liquids rich gas developments that are more capital intensive on a per mcfe basis as compared to natural gas developments 
while our average dd a rate in was  our rate for the fourth quarter of was 
during  this rate increased as the additional cost of each mcfe added was higher 
in addition  the full year average rate was negatively impacted by downward reserve revisions primarily due to natural gas price declines combined with the net impact of selling our remaining gulf of mexico assets 
without these items  our average dd a rate for the year ended december  would have been 
general and administrative g a expense per mcfe increased during primarily due to employee related expenses associated with our domestic work force combined with lower domestic production 
during  we capitalized million per mcfe of direct internal costs as compared to million per mcfe during in the fourth quarter of we recorded a ceiling test writedown of billion per mcfe due to a net decrease in the discounted value of our proved reserves 
the primary reason for the change in value was negative price related reserve revisions as a result of a decrease in the natural gas sec pricing 
other expenses of million per mcfe include a writedown of million of subsea wellhead inventory that was not included in the sale of our gulf of mexico assets and contract termination costs of million in consideration of other services 
international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  decreased over the components of the period to period change are as follows loe per mcfe decreased by per mcfe primarily due to lower non recurring workover activity during recurring loe was essentially flat on a per unit basis with a decrease of per mcfe  or 
production and other taxes per mcfe decreased by due to an overall change in the mix of production that was lifted and sold from the various pscs in malaysia including the fields brought online during the fourth quarter of the production tax rates per barrel of oil lifted and sold from these newer developments are lower  per the terms of our pscs  while we recover our costs associated with these developments 
total dd a expense increased in compared to due to a combination of an increase in the average dd a rate and a increase in production during our average annual dd a rate per mcfe increased when compared to the average annual rate 
the average annual rate when compared to the end of year rate of was higher and was primarily due to the costs of two unsuccessful wells offshore malaysia  which increased the amount subject to depletion without any associated reserve additions 
year ended december  compared to december  the following table presents information comparing our operating expenses for the following periods unit of production total amount year ended december  percentage increase decrease year ended december  percentage increase decrease per mcfe in millions domestic lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative other total operating expenses international lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative total operating expenses total lease operating production and other taxes depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative other total operating expenses domestic operations 
our domestic operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  increased over those for the components of the significant period to period change are as follows the increase in domestic loe per mcfe resulted from a per mcfe increase in the normally recurring portion of our loe 
recurring loe in our rocky mountains region accounted for approximately of the increase due to increased water handling and overall operating and service related costs in the basins in which we operate 
in addition  loe increased per mcfe due to increased transportation costs resulting from the commencement of firm transportation contracts in our mid continent region throughout production and other taxes per mcfe increased due to a increase in realized oil prices in  coupled with a increase in oil and natural gas production subject to production taxes 
since late  the shift of our capital investments toward the oil plays in our portfolio has resulted in an increase in our dd a rate 
the increase in total dd a expense is related to the increase in the dd a rate  coupled with a slight increase in our production volumes during compared to g a expense per mcfe increased during due to employee related expenses associated with the growth we experienced in our domestic workforce and approximately million of legal expenses related to litigation in which we were the plaintiff 
during  we capitalized million per mcfe of direct internal costs as compared to million per mcfe during during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of million per mcfe related to certain claims related to the bankruptcy proceedings associated with txco resources inc international operations 
our international operating expenses for  stated on a mcfe basis  increased over the components of the period to period change are as follows loe per mcfe increased due to non recurring pipeline and facilities repair in malaysia  fixed production costs associated with certain of our pscs in malaysia and increased overall operating service costs from the various pscs during compared to production and other taxes per mcfe increased due to an increase  per the terms of the pscs  in the tax rate per barrel of oil lifted and sold as a result of the increase in realized oil prices in total dd a expense increased due to an increase in volumes during compared to combined with an increase in our ratio of costs subject to depletion over proved reserves in the fourth quarter related to our new offshore malaysian developments

interest expense associated with oil and gas properties excluded from amortization is capitalized into oil and gas properties 
capitalized interest decreased in as compared to  due to a reduction in our average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization 
as a result of the october sale of our gulf of mexico assets  unproved oil and gas properties that had been previously excluded from amortization were removed from such classification 
capitalized interest increased in as compared to due to an increase in the average balance of oil and gas properties excluded from amortization  primarily resulting from the acquisition of assets in the uinta basin of utah 
commodity derivative income 
the fluctuations in commodity derivative income from period to period are due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and changes in our outstanding hedging contracts during these periods 
taxes 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate for all periods was different than the federal statutory tax rate due to deductions that do not generate tax benefits  state income taxes and the differences between international and us federal statutory rates 
our effective tax rate generally approximates 
our effective tax rate for was affected by our decision to repatriate international earnings  use foreign tax credits ftcs  a valuation allowance for ftcs and the recording of a valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset in malaysia 
please see the discussion and tables in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  which are incorporated herein by reference 
estimates of future taxable income can be significantly affected by changes in oil and natural gas prices  the timing  amount and location of future production  operating expenses  and capital costs 
liquidity and capital resources we must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows 
we accomplish this through successful drilling programs and property acquisitions 
these activities require substantial capital expenditures 
lower prices for oil  natural gas and ngls may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital  as further described below 
we establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year 
our capital budgets excluding acquisitions are created based upon our estimate of internally generated sources of cash  which includes cash flows from operations and if applicable  non strategic asset sales 
approximately of our expected domestic oil and gas production excluding ngls supporting the current capital budget estimate is hedged 
our capital budget  excluding estimated capitalized interest and overhead of million  is expected to be between billion and focuses on projects with higher return on investment  which we believe generate and lay the foundation for oil production growth in and thereafter 
of the total capital budget  approximately billion will be allocated to our domestic business 
substantially all of the budget is allocated to oil or liquids rich projects 
actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil  natural gas and ngl prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services  the extent to which properties are acquired or non strategic assets sold 
we continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
we believe we have the operational flexibility to react quickly with our capital expenditures to changes in circumstances and our cash flows from operations 
during  we received proceeds from the sale of non strategic assets of million  issued billion aggregate principal of senior notes due repurchased our million aggregate principal of senior subordinated notes due  and repurchased our million aggregate principal of senior subordinated notes due we used a portion of the proceeds from the billion senior notes offering combined with the proceeds from our non strategic asset sale program to reduce borrowings outstanding under our credit arrangements  as well as redeem our senior subordinated notes due as a result  at december   we had available borrowing capacity of billion under our credit arrangements 
in october  we closed the sale of our remaining assets in the gulf of mexico to w t offshore  inc for approximately million  subject to customary post closing adjustments 
we expect to substantially fund our capital program with cash flows from operations  proceeds from non strategic asset sales during the year and available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
we believe that the company s liquidity position and our ability to generate cash flows from our asset portfolio will be adequate to fund operations 
we continue to hold auction rate securities with a fair value of million 
we attempt to sell these securities every days until the auctions succeed  the issuer calls the securities or the securities mature 
we currently do not believe that the decrease in the fair value of these investments is permanent or that the failure of the auction mechanism will have a material impact on our liquidity given the amount of our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements 
see note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for more information regarding the auction rate securities 
credit arrangements 
we maintain a revolving credit facility of billion that matures in june  as well as money market lines of credit of million  for a total borrowing capacity of billion at december  our long term debt includes senior and senior subordinated notes which total billion 
at december   we had no scheduled maturities of senior notes or senior subordinated notes until for a more detailed description of the terms of our credit arrangements and senior and senior subordinated notes  please see note  debt  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  which are incorporated herein by reference 
at february   we had no letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility 
we had outstanding borrowings of million under our credit facility 
our available borrowing capacity under our credit arrangements was approximately billion  and we had million in other undrawn letters of credit outstanding 
commitments under joint operating agreements 
most of our properties are operated through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as drilling contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator if a non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
working capital 
our working capital balance fluctuates as a result of the timing and amount of borrowings or repayments under our credit arrangements  changes in the fair value of our outstanding commodity derivative instruments as well as the timing of receiving reimbursement of amounts paid by us for the benefit of joint venture partners 
without the effects of commodity derivative instruments  we typically have a working capital deficit or a relatively small amount of positive working capital 
we anticipate that our capital investment levels will exceed our estimate of cash flows from operations 
we expect to sell non strategic assets and use available capacity under our credit arrangements to fund any shortfall 
at december  and  we had negative working capital of million and million  respectively 
the changes in our working capital are primarily a result of the timing of the collection of receivables  changes in the fair value of our derivative positions  the timing of crude oil liftings in our international operations  drilling activities  payments made by us to vendors and other operators and the timing and amount of advances received from our joint operations 
cash flows from operations 
cash flows from operations are our primary source of capital and liquidity and are primarily affected by sale of our oil  natural gas and ngls  as well as commodity prices  net of the effects of settlements of our derivative contracts and changes in working capital 
we sell substantially all of our oil  gas and ngls under floating price  market sensitive contracts 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months 
as of december   we had no open derivative contracts for ngls 
see oil and gas hedging below 
we typically receive the cash associated with oil and gas sales within days of production 
as a result  cash flows from operations and income from operations generally correlate  but cash flows from operations are impacted by changes in working capital and are not affected by dd a  ceiling test writedowns  other impairments or other non cash charges or credits 
our net cash flows from operations were approximately billion in and billion in and the changes in cash flow from operations in compared to was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities coupled with a decrease in our after tax cash margin as a result of a significant increase in cash taxes in malaysia 
cash flows from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for was billion compared to billion for during  we spent approximately billion for additions to property and equipment including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  and received proceeds of million from sales of oil and gas properties 
during  we spent approximately billion for additions to property and equipment including million for acquisitions of oil and gas properties  received proceeds of million from sales of oil and gas properties  and redeemed investments of million 
cash flows from financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities for was million compared to million for during  we reduced our borrowings under our revolving credit facility by million  issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at par and paid approximately million in associated debt issue costs  repaid our million and million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due and  respectively  received proceeds of million from the issuances of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  and repurchased million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
during  we reduced our borrowings under our revolving credit facility arrangements by million  issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due at of par and paid approximately million in associated debt issue costs  paid approximately million in debt issue costs associated with our new revolving credit facility  received proceeds of million from the issuances of shares of our common stock upon the exercise of stock options  and repurchased million of our common stock surrendered by employees to pay tax withholding upon the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
capital expenditures 
our capital investments of billion for decreased from our capital investments of billion during these amounts exclude negligible acquisitions during and million in  and recorded asset retirement obligations of million and million in the respective years 
of the total billion invested during  we invested billion in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property leasehold and million outside the united states 
our capital investments of billion for increased from our capital investments of billion during these amounts exclude acquisitions of million and million in and  respectively  and recorded asset retirement obligations of million and million in the respective years 
of the total billion spent during  we invested billion in domestic exploitation and development  million in domestic exploration exclusive of exploitation and leasehold activity  million in leasing domestic proved and unproved property leasehold and million outside the united states 
we have budgeted between billion of planned capital investments in the planned budget excludes estimated capitalized interest and overhead of approximately million  as well as any acquisitions 
substantially all of the budget is allocated to oil or liquids rich projects 
actual levels of capital expenditures may vary significantly due to many factors  including drilling results  oil  natural gas and ngl prices  industry conditions  the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired 
in addition  at times we have increased our capital budget as a result of acquisitions or successful drilling 
we continue to screen for attractive acquisition opportunities  however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our significant contractual obligations by maturity as of december  total less than year years years more than years in millions debt senior notes due senior notes due senior subordinated notes due senior subordinated notes due total debt other obligations interest payments net derivative assets liabilities asset retirement obligations operating leases and other firm transportation oil and gas activities total other obligations total contractual obligations includes agreements for office space  platform construction  drilling rigs and other equipment  as well as certain service contracts 
the majority of these obligations are related to contracts for platform construction and drilling rigs  and are included at the gross contractual value 
due to our various working interests where these service contracts will be utilized  it is not feasible to estimate a net contractual obligation 
net payments under these contracts are accounted for as capital additions to our oil and gas properties and could be significantly less than the gross obligation disclosed 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual commitments pertaining to exploration  development and production activities 
we have work related commitments for  among other things  drilling wells  obtaining and processing seismic data  natural gas transportation and fulfilling other related commitments 
at december   these work related commitments totaled million  all of which were attributable to our international business 
actual amounts by maturity are not included because their timing cannot be accurately predicted 
we have various oil and gas production volume delivery commitments that are related to our domestic operations 
given the size of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and production capacity in the respective divisions  we currently believe that we have sufficient reserves and production to fulfill these commitments 
however  in the event that we are unable to meet our crude oil volume delivery commitments  we would incur deficiency fees ranging from to per barrel 
see items and  business and properties for a description of our production and proved reserves 
as of december   our delivery commitments through were as follows total less than year years years more than years natural gas mmmbtus oil mbbls our oil delivery commitments include a particular commitment with a salt lake city  utah refiner 
this delivery commitment will begin upon the refiner completing the expansion of their facility  which is expected in late or early our delivery commitment is to deliver approximately  barrels of oil per day over a year period 
this delivery commitment represents approximately of our committed oil volumes for each of the years through  increases to in  and is of our commitment through oil and gas hedging we utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our future oil and gas production 
we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and gas production for the next months 
as of december   we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our ngl production 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between the nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see critical accounting policies and estimates commodity derivative activities below and oil  natural gas and ngl prices in item a of this report 
please see the discussion and tables in note  derivative financial instruments  and note  fair value measurements  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding the accounting applicable to our oil and gas derivative contracts  a listing of open contracts and the estimated fair market value of those contracts as of december  between january  and february   we entered into additional derivative contracts as set forth below

however  as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we have various contractual work commitments as described above under contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under generally accepted accounting principles 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with the audit committee of our board of directors 
see results of operations above and note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates we make 
for discussion purposes  we have divided our significant policies into four categories 
set forth below is an overview of each of our significant accounting policies by category 
we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method 
this method of accounting requires the following significant estimates quantity of our proved oil and gas reserves  costs withheld from amortization  and future costs to develop and abandon our oil and gas properties 
accounting for business combinations requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the acquired company 
accounting for commodity derivative activities requires estimates and assumptions regarding the fair value of derivative positions 
stock based compensation costs require estimates and assumptions regarding the grant date fair value of awards  the determination of which requires significant estimates and subjective judgments 
oil and gas activities 
accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and gas activities are available successful efforts and full cost 
the most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment 
the successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed  while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs 
both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities 
impairment of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method is a two step test that compares the carrying value of the properties to the undiscounted cash flows to see if an impairment is required 
if required  the impairment is the difference between the carrying value of individual oil and gas properties and their estimated fair value using forward looking prices 
impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves  using sec pricing  costs in effect at year end and a discount rate 
full cost method 
we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into cost centers the amortization base that are established on a country by country basis 
such amounts include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs and delay rentals 
capitalized costs also include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other expenses that are estimated to directly relate to our exploration and development activities 
interest costs related to unproved properties also are capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties less accumulated amortization  plus an estimate of our future development costs and estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs  net of salvage values are amortized on a unit of production method based on our estimate of total proved reserves 
amortization is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
our financial position and results of operations would have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
proved oil and gas reserves 
our engineering estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and the full cost ceiling limitation 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas reserves that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs based on sec pricing and under period end economic and operating conditions 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
changes in oil  gas and ngl prices  operating costs and expected performance from a given reservoir also will result in future revisions to the amount of our estimated proved reserves 
all reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by our petroleum engineering staff 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
estimated proved oil  gas and ngl reserves are a significant component of our calculation of dd a expense  and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves are revised upward  earnings would increase due to lower depletion expense 
likewise  if reserves are revised downward  earnings would decrease due to higher depletion expense or due to a ceiling test writedown 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic proved reserves of approximately  or bcfe 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in malaysia of approximately  or bcfe 
to change our china dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our proved reserves in china of approximately  or bcfe 
full cost ceiling limitation 
under the full cost method  we are subject to quarterly calculations of a ceiling or limitation on the amount of costs associated with our oil and gas properties that can be capitalized on our balance sheet 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the applicable cost center ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test writedown to the extent of such excess 
if required  a ceiling test writedown reduces earnings and stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and  holding other factors constant  results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the ceiling limitation is applied separately for each country in which we have oil and gas properties 
the discounted present value of our proved reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
the ceiling value of oil  gas and ngl reserves is calculated based on sec pricing and costs in effect as of the last day of the quarter 
the full cost ceiling test impairment calculation also takes into consideration the effects of hedging contracts that are designated for hedge accounting  if any 
at december   the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon sec pricing of per mmbtu for natural gas and per barrel for oil 
using these prices  the cost center ceiling at december  was below the net capitalized costs of our domestic oil and gas properties  resulting in a ceiling test writedown of approximately billion 
at december   the malaysia and china cost center ceilings exceeded the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties by approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
holding all other factors constant  it is possible that we could experience a ceiling test writedown in malaysia and china if the applicable average oil price declined approximately and  respectively  from prices used at december  given the fluctuation of oil  natural gas and ngl prices  it is reasonably possible that the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves will change in the near term 
if commodity prices decline  or if we have downward revisions to our estimated proved reserves  it is possible that additional writedowns of our oil and gas properties could occur in the future 
costs withheld from amortization 
costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties 
the costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data  wells currently drilling and capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base 
leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
leasehold costs are transferred to our amortization base to the extent a reduction in value has occurred or a charge is made against earnings if the costs were incurred in a country for which a reserve base has not been established 
if a reserve base for a country in which we are conducting operations has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
in addition  a portion of incurred if not previously included in the amortization base and future estimated development costs associated with qualifying major development projects may be temporarily excluded from amortization 
to qualify  a project must require significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development eg  the installation of an offshore production platform from which development wells are to be drilled 
incurred and estimated future development costs are allocated between completed and future work 
any temporarily excluded costs are included in the amortization base upon the earlier of when the associated reserves are determined to be proved or impairment is indicated 
our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involve a significant amount of judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors  including our drilling plans  availability of capital  project economics and results of drilling on adjacent acreage 
at december   we had a total of approximately billion of costs excluded from the amortization base of our respective full cost pools  the majority of which related to our domestic full cost pool 
inclusion of some or all of our domestic unevaluated property costs in our domestic full cost pool  without adding any associated reserves  would have resulted in a larger ceiling test writedown 
the same test applied to our international business units resulted in an excess of the cost center ceilings over the carrying value of our oil and gas properties for each of our international full cost pools 
holding all other factors constant  including all of our unevaluated property costs in our malaysia and china amortization bases would not have resulted in a ceiling test writedown for either full cost pool 
future development and abandonment costs 
future development costs include costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves such as drilling costs and the installation of production equipment 
future abandonment costs include costs to dismantle and relocate or dispose of our production platforms  gathering systems and related structures and restoration costs of land and seabed 
we develop estimates of these costs for each of our properties based upon their geographic location  type of production structure  water depth  reservoir depth and characteristics  market demand for equipment  currently available procedures and ongoing consultations with construction and engineering consultants 
because these costs typically extend many years into the future  estimating these future costs is difficult and requires management to make judgments that are subject to future revisions based upon numerous factors  including changing technology and the political and regulatory environment 
we review our assumptions and estimates of future development and abandonment costs on an annual basis  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would affect our assumptions and estimates 
the accounting guidance for future abandonment costs requires that a liability for the discounted fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
holding all other factors constant  if our estimate of future development and abandonment costs is revised upward  earnings would decrease due to higher dd a expense 
likewise  if these estimates are revised downward  earnings would increase due to lower dd a expense 
to change our domestic dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our domestic future development and abandonment costs of approximately  or million 
to change our malaysia dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in malaysia of approximately  or million 
to change our china dd a rate by per mcfe for the year ended december  would have required a change in the estimate of our future development and abandonment costs in china of approximately  or million 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations 
as part of our growth strategy  we monitor and screen for potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the purchase price in an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date  which may occur many months after the announcement date 
therefore  while the consideration to be paid may be fixed  the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to change during the period between the announcement date and the acquisition date 
our most significant estimates in our allocation typically relate to the value assigned to future recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties 
to the extent the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired  we are required to record the excess as goodwill 
as the allocation of the purchase price is subject to significant estimates and subjective judgments  the accuracy of this assessment is inherently uncertain 
the value allocated to recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and unproved properties is subject to the cost center ceiling as described under full cost ceiling limitation above 
the accounting standard for business combinations establishes how a purchaser recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the standard also sets forth guidance related to the recognition  measurement and disclosure related to goodwill acquired in a business combination or gains associated with a bargain purchase transaction 
commodity derivative activities 
under accounting rules  we may elect to designate certain derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges against the price that we will receive for our future oil and gas production 
we do not designate future price risk management activities as accounting hedges 
because derivative contracts not designated for hedge accounting are accounted for on a mark to market basis  we have in the past experienced  and are likely in the future to experience non cash volatility in our reported earnings during periods of commodity price volatility 
as of december   we had net derivative assets of million  of which  based on total hedged volumes  was measured based upon our valuation model ie black scholes and  as such  is classified as a level fair value measurement 
derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty and subject to contractual terms which provide for net settlement are reported on a net basis on our consolidated balance sheet 
in determining the amounts to be recorded for our open hedge contracts  we are required to estimate the fair value of the derivative 
our valuation models for derivative contracts are primarily industry standard models that consider various inputs including a quoted forward prices for commodities  b time value  c volatility factors  d counterparty credit risk and e current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
the calculation of the fair value of our option contracts requires the use of an option pricing model 
the estimated future prices are compared to the prices fixed by the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted to calculate the fair value of the derivative contracts 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differences and interest rates 
as a result  the value of these contracts at their respective settlement dates could be significantly different than the fair value as of december  we periodically validate our valuations using independent third party quotations 
the determination of the fair values of derivative instruments incorporates various factors which include not only the impact of our non performance risk on our liabilities but also the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements such as cash deposits  letters of credit and priority interests 
we utilize credit default swap values to assess the impact of non performance risk when evaluating both our liabilities to and receivables from counterparties 
stock based compensation 
we apply a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation which requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
for equity based compensation awards  compensation expense is based on the fair value on the grant or modification date and is recognized in our financial statements over the vesting period 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options and a lattice based model for our performance and market based restricted stock and restricted stock units 
additionally in  we granted cash settled restricted stock units that are accounted for under the liability method which requires us to recognize the fair value of each award based on the underlying share price at the end of each period 
see note  stock based compensation  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a full discussion of our stock based compensation 
new accounting requirements in december  the fasb issued guidance regarding the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities 
the guidance will require disclosure of gross information and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset arrangement 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after january  we do not expect adoption of the additional disclosures regarding offsetting assets and liabilities to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued guidance impacting the presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance eliminates the current option to report components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in equity 
the guidance is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect an entity s equity 
the guidance is retrospective and effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we adopted the provisions for the quarter ended march  adopting the disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance regarding fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
the most significant change required  for level fair value measurements  disclosure of quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after december  we adopted the provisions for the quarter ended march  adopting the additional fair value measurement and disclosure requirements did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
regulation exploration and development and the production and sale of oil  gas and ngls are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations 
an overview of these regulations is set forth in items and  business and properties regulation 
we believe we are in substantial compliance with currently applicable laws and regulations and that continued substantial compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  current regulatory requirements may change  currently unforeseen environmental incidents may occur or past non compliance with environmental laws or regulations may be discovered 
please see the discussion under the caption we are subject to complex laws and regulatory actions that can affect the cost  manner  feasibility or timing of doing business  in item a of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in oil  natural gas and ngl prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as discussed below 
oil  natural gas and ngl prices as part of our risk management program  we generally hedge a substantial  but varying  portion of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production for the next months to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
as of december   we had no outstanding derivative contracts related to our ngl production 
in the case of significant acquisitions  we may hedge acquired production for a longer period 
in addition  we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between nymex henry hub posted prices and those of our physical pricing points 
reducing our exposure to price volatility helps ensure that we have adequate funds available for our capital programs and helps us manage returns on some of our acquisitions and more price sensitive drilling programs 
our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our production is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions 
while the use of hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  their use also may limit future benefits from favorable price movements 
in addition  the use of hedging transactions may involve basis risk 
all of our hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions also involves the risk that the counterparties  which generally are financial institutions  will be unable to meet the financial terms of such transactions 
our derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize our exposure to any individual counterparty 
at december   seven of our counterparties accounted for approximately of our estimated future hedged production with no single counterparty accounting for more than of that production 
for a further discussion of our hedging activities  see the information under the caption oil and gas hedging and critical accounting policies and estimates in item of this report and the discussion and tables in note  derivative financial instruments  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report  which is incorporated herein by reference 
interest rates we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because of our obligations were at fixed rates as of december  a increase in libor would not impact our interest cost on debt outstanding as of december   but would affect the fair value of outstanding debt  as well as interest cost associated with future debt issuances or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange rates the functional currency for all of our foreign operations is the us dollar 
to the extent that business transactions in these countries are not denominated in the respective country s functional currency  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
we consider our current risk exposure to exchange rate movements  based on net cash flows  to be immaterial 
we did not have any open derivative contracts relating to foreign currencies at december
