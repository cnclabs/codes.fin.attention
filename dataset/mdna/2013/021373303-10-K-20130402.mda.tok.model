item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a delaware company that develops  manufactures and sells nano lithium titanate batteries and energy storage systems 
our nano lithium titanate battery systems offer higher power density  longer cycle life  rapid charge and discharge capabilities  a wider operating temperature range and higher levels of safety than conventional lithium ion batteries 
we target applications that effectively utilize the key attributes of our technology  and these applications can be found primarily in the electric grid  transportation commercial vehicles  and industrial market segments 
starting in we began looking at additional opportunities to expand the application of our battery technology into various industrial markets that have a need for the attributes of our battery technology 
we believe that in the aggregate  our target markets are multi billion dollar emerging markets with room for a number of successful suppliers 
at the present time  we perceive no dominant provider and we believe that as a result of our significant differentiated product attributes  the overall strength of our management team  and the recognition we are receiving in the marketplace  that we have a reasonable chance of becoming one of the successful suppliers 
our proprietary technology platform gives our products a number of unique  highly sought after attributes that clearly differentiate our products from their alternatives 
included in these attributes are substantially longer cycle and calendar lives  a rapid recharge time  the ability to provide instantaneous high power  a wide operating temperature range and increased operational safety 
our historical revenues have been generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations  and government contracts and grants 
we expect future revenues to consist primarily of product sales 
we currently have agreements in place to develop a suite of energy storage solutions for the stationary power market  provide battery modules to a us based bus manufacturer and are negotiating agreements to develop battery modules for various other industrial applications  and supply a one megawatt alti ess energy storage system for a test of wind energy integration 
in  we formed altair nanotechnologies china co  ltd 
altair china and northern altair nanotechnologies co  ltd 
northern altair 
we anticipate this expansion will allow us to participate in the fast growing china market 
general outlook our current focus is on the development of battery systems that we anticipate will eventually bring a substantial amount of revenue volume and gross profit from product sales into the electric grid  transportation  and industrial markets 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following in april  we entered into an economic development deal with the cities of wu an and handan in hebei province in china 
under our multi year contract with the city of wu an  altairnano shall sell and deliver electric buses to wu an over a multi year period 
in august  we received a million down payment on the first million electric bus order from wu an 
we anticipate that the deliveries for this order shall be made in mid we built five to megawatt energy storage systems during we validated four of those systems and shipped three of them to our customers in  including the hawaii natural energy institute  vestas and tsk solar 
the fourth system was shipped in early to an east coast utility customer  and the fifth system is ready for installation in hawaii 
we anticipate that these energy storage systems will help to establish the commercial value of our products and facilitate the future sale of similarly sized  or larger  systems 
in fact  the hawaii natural energy institute purchased their third energy storage system from us in january they have ordered our new megawatt alti ess advantage 
we are a supplier of nano lithium titanate battery modules to proterra  which is a leading designer and manufacturer of all electric transit buses 
in  we sold million of battery modules to proterra 
in may  we signed a contract to supply battery modules to proterra and entered into a test and validation program 
in june  proterra released its first purchase order under the agreement for deliveries in we have entered into discussions with a number of other transportation and industrial customers regarding joint development products or purchases of our battery products 
these customers are now testing and prototyping our modules  application kits and battery systems in a variety of applications 
in  we submitted our nano lithium titanate battery cells for testing at the institute in china 
we received approval for the sale of our nano lithium titanate batteries in china in december on october   northern altair successfully completed a bidding process for a acre parcel of land in wu an china  which will be used for the company s nlto and energy storage system manufacturing operations in china 
on october   northern altair entered into a contract on assignment of state owned construction land use right the land use agreement  pursuant to which northern altair will acquire the right to use the acres of commercial land north of dongzhuchang village in wu an city  china for a period of years subject to the terms and conditions of the land use agreement 
as consideration for the land use right  northern altair paid a land use fee of approximately million and land transfer taxes and fees of approximately million and agreed to make fixed asset investments on the land of approximately million  subject to loan guarantees and other incentives from wu an  china  over an unspecified period of time up to the year life of the land use right  with initial construction being required to begin by march  in january  initial construction on a manufacturing facility began on the company s land use right in china 
the costs incurred to date by the company are not material 
the company estimates the initial phase of this project will cost approximately million and will be completed in the company has not yet obtained loan guarantees for these costs 
additional construction phases will be contingent upon loan guarantees and other incentives from wu an  china as well as other market conditions 
the total fixed asset investments shall include the cost of buildings  structures  auxiliary facilities  and equipment  as well as the land use fee 
northern altair may transfer and sublease portions of the granted land once it has invested of the total fixed asset investments amount and completed of the project 
closing occurred on november  separate from the land use agreement  northern altair received million package of cash incentives in november to facilitate northern altair s establishment of operations and construction efforts 
the actual scope of northern altair s construction project and manufacturing operations will be based on the anticipated market demand for the company s products and on the level of negotiated incentives 
in august  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with shenhua science technology and the national institute of low carbon energy nice in china 
we entered into discussions about a possible pilot project that would test and demonstrate the commercial use of our systems 
we are in discussions with a number of industrial manufacturers of forklifts  elevators  mining  rail and other electric equipment whose use requires the long life  rapid recharge  extreme operating temperature range or other differentiating attributes of our battery technology 
we have supplied application kits to several of these companies for testing and evaluation 
in february  we signed an million contract with inversiones energ ticas  sa de sa ine for the supply and installation of a megawatt alti ess advanced battery system in el salvador 
total revenue under the contract is expected to be recognized over an expected month period following altair s receipt of the notice to proceed 
we continue to work with ine to acquire the necessary approvals to enable battery based energy storage on the el salvador electric grid and received several contract extensions in we remain optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
however  we now have a number of key reference customers including vestas and the hawaii natural energy institute  which shall help validate the technical and commercial operation of our systems 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity altair s cash and cash equivalents decreased by million  from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in cash was primarily due to the million of cash used in operating activities during the bulk of the cash used in operations went to cover our net loss of million offset by million in proceeds from three short term notes payable used towards the million build up of work in process inventory related to the fulfillment of customer sales backlog  of which million is included in deferred contract costs 
northern altair also received cash grant incentives of million from the wu an government and recorded it as restricted cash  which can be used subject to meeting certain guidelines agreed upon by the wu an government and the company 
during we issued shares of common stock and warrants to purchase shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
we recorded a million warrant liability related to this capital raise 
we also paid off  of debt and  in warrant redemptions 
on july  we issued  shares at each to canon for gross proceeds of million 
we had paid and million in related expenses in and  respectively 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
in april  million was transferred to altair china to be used towards our china operations 
the board of directors has developed a funding process for both our u 
s 
operations and our china operations moving forward 
for china  northern altair received a year land use right certificate for acres of commercial land in china on november  as a result  intangible assets increased by million and deferred income increased by million for the cash grant incentives from the wu an government 
now that the land transfer has been received and assuming our development of suitable manufacturing plans and finalization of orders  we believe that cash on hand and restricted cash available for operations will be sufficient to fund operations and the million manufacturing facility in china 
in the us  our operations may be supported in the near term by selling inventory  equipment and services to altair china  and receiving fees associated with intellectual property licensing 
we received million in the fourth quarter of from short term debt that will become due in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we plan to work with our banks to either refinance or repay this short term debt and obtain new loans 
the million of restricted cash located in a bank in china is designated for use in operations 
the company plans to set aside this cash with banks in china and in return obtain loans if needed for use as operating capital in us operations 
a summary of our cash position at december  included cash and cash equivalents of million 
in addition  we have million in restricted cash of which million is classified as short term 
a  stand by letter of credit is included in the million short term restricted cash 
this  stand by letter of credit will be released in the first quarter of the remaining million in restricted cash  relates to the grant incentives which is classified as long term 
we received million in customer receipts during we are expecting an estimated million in cash receipts during which relates to three large projects sitting in our deferred revenue at december  of this amount  million has already been invoiced and is in our accounts receivable balance at december  and the other million is expected to be invoiced for these large projects in the first half of we evaluate our capital needs and the availability of capital on an ongoing basis and  consistent with past practice  expect to seek capital when and on such terms as we deem appropriate based upon our assessment of our current liquidity  capital needs and the availability of capital 
over the long term  we anticipate substantially increasing revenues by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales in the stationary power  electric bus and selected other industrial markets 
capital commitments and expenditures the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands of dollars contractual obligations total yr yrs yrs yrs note payable contractual service agreements capital leases purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet transactions during results of operations the following table sets forth certain selected  unaudited  condensed consolidated financial data for the periods indicated 
altair nanotechnologies inc 
and subsidiaries consolidated statements of operations expressed in thousands of united states dollars power and energy group all other consolidated twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended revenues product sales license fees commercial collaborations contracts and grants total revenues cost of goods sold product commercial collaborations contracts and grants warranty and inventory reserves total cost of goods sold gross loss profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization loss on diposal of assets total operating expenses loss income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net change in market value of warrants loss on foreign exchange total other income  net net loss income fiscal year vs 
revenues power and energy group revenue for the year ending december  was million 
this amount included revenue from battery modules sold to fifteen customers and battery cells sold to customers 
revenues decreased by million  from approximately million in to approximately million during  as a result of the sale of million of products sold to yte during  which facilitated our entry into the china market 
this included  amp hour cells  one alti ess system and nano lithium titanate oxide 
the decrease is also a result of the sale of batteries to proterra for million in vs 
million in and due to decreased revenue recognition for product sales  however  deferred revenues increased million to million as of december  all other contracts and grants revenue for was from our aro nanosensor grant with the us army 
our portion of this contract was completed as of december   with pass through revenues from a subcontractor continuing through july  cost of goods sold in the power and energy group the cost of goods sold for product sales was million for cost of goods sold cogs exceeded product sales by million due primarily to fixed manufacturing costs expensed during the period due to low inventory production levels  an increase in our inventory reserve and also accrued contract losses from cost increases associated with the launch of new electric grid products 
this compared to million of total cogs for the same period in  due primarily to the yte and proterra revenue generated during the cogs associated with the yte product sales during was higher than the revenue generated by those product sales  leading to a gross loss of million in the for the power and energy group 
we sold this product to yte at less than our cost in order to expose our products to the potentially large china economic market 
our gross margins in any year are not indicative of future gross margins 
at this early stage of development  our product mix  volume  per unit pricing and cost structure may change significantly from year to year  and our margins may expand or contract depending upon the mix and timing of orders in future quarters 
in general  we expect our margins to increase as our volume of business increases and we completely transition from product prototypes to commercial  scalable manufacturing processes 
operating expenses operating expenses overall were down million during  from million during to million during this reduction is the result of constrained spending in almost all areas of the company during and due to recording impaired assets of million and severance expenses of million during average employee headcount in the us decreased by  from employees during to employees for the corresponding period 
average employee headcount in china increased from zero employees during to employees for the corresponding period 
research and development expenses decreased million from million during to million during sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  from million during to million during general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million during to million during we continue to focus on reducing our cost structure in areas that will not adversely affect growing our product revenues 
net loss overall net loss decreased million from million per share in to million per share in  primarily due to a decrease in overall operating expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents consist principally of bank deposits and institutional money market funds 
short term investments that are highly liquid have insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of days or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents 
our u 
s operating cash balances are maintained in bank accounts that are insured up to  for each owner by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
as of december  and  almost all of the company s cash included cash on hand and deposits in accounts maintained within the prc where there is currently no rule or regulation in place for obligatory insurance to cover bank deposits in the event of bank failure 
however  the company has not experienced any losses in such accounts 
at december  and we had cash of million and million  respectively 
we have one standby letter of credit in the u 
s for  which is in an uninsured money market account and it is scheduled to be released in the first quarter of accounts receivable accounts receivable consists of amounts due from customers for services and product sales  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by reviewing each customer account and specifically identifying any potential for loss 
inventory we value our inventories generally at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we employ a full absorption procedure using standard cost techniques 
the standards are customarily reviewed and adjusted every three months 
overhead rates are recorded to inventory based on normal capacity 
any idle facility costs or excessive spoilage are recorded as current period charges 
research and development expenditures the costs of materials  equipment  or facilities that are acquired or constructed for a particular research and development project and that have no alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise are expensed as research and development costs at the time the costs are incurred 
research and development expenditures related to materials and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise are capitalized when acquired or constructed 
research and development expenditures  which include the cost of materials consumed in research and development activities  salaries  wages and other costs of personnel engaged in research and development  costs of services performed by others for research and development on our behalf and indirect costs are expensed as research and development costs when incurred 
stock based compensation we measure the cost of services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost is recognized over the period during which services are provided in exchange for the award  known as the requisite service period 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value 
our estimate of the cash flows is based on the information available at the time including the following internal budgets  sales forecasts  customer trends  anticipated production volumes  and market conditions over an estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset which may range from to years for most equipment and up to years for our building and related building improvements 
if impairment is indicated  the asset value is written down to its fair value 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product or the assets used to produce it  a history of operating or cash flow losses and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
as of december   we estimate that our future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are greater than the carrying value of our long lived assets 
our estimated future cash flows include anticipated product margins and commercial collaborations  since our long lived asset base  which is primarily composed of production  laboratory and testing equipment is utilized to fulfill customer contracts in all revenue categories 
property  plant and equipment held and used and held and not used are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is recorded using the straight line method over the following useful lives building and improvements years nanoparticle production equipment years vehicles years furniture and office equipment years patents are related to the nanoparticle production technology and stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is recorded using the straight line method over their useful lives 
the weighted average useful lives are years 
land use rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is recorded using the straight line method over their year useful lives 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a completed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates and the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which they become known 
payments received in advance relating to the future performance of services or deliveries of products are deferred until the performance of the service is complete or the product is shipped 
upfront payments received in connection with certain rights granted in contractual arrangements are deferred and revenue is recognized over the related time period which the benefits are received 
accrued warranty we provide a limited warranty for battery packs and energy storage systems 
a liability is recorded for estimated warranty obligations at the date products are sold 
since these are new products  the estimated cost of warranty coverage is based on cell and module life cycle testing and compared for reasonableness to warranty rates on competing battery products 
as sufficient actual historical data is collected on the new product  the estimated cost of warranty coverage will be adjusted accordingly 
the liability for estimated warranty obligations may also be adjusted based on specific warranty issues identified 
overhead allocation facilities overhead and production employees fringe benefit costs are initially recorded in general and administrative expenses and then allocated to research and development and product inventories based on relative labor costs 
production equipment depreciation expense is recorded to cost of goods sold as the equipment is used to produce product sold to customers and production equipment depreciation is attached to  and transferred to product in ending inventory until such product is used to satisfy customer orders 
net loss per common share basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per share is computed using the weighted average number of common and potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period 
potentially dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 
potentially dilutive shares are excluded from the computation if their effect is anti dilutive 
we had a net loss for all periods presented herein  therefore  none of the stock options and warrants outstanding during each of the periods presented were included in the computation of diluted loss per share as they were anti dilutive 
stock options and warrants to purchase a total of  as of december  and  shares as of december  were excluded from the calculations of diluted loss per share for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable or received or receivable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year 
deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid  and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  management considers all potential sources of taxable income  including income available in carryback periods  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  projections of taxable income  and income from tax planning strategies  as well as all available positive and negative evidence 
positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations  projections of future profitability within the carryforward period  including from tax planning strategies  and the company s experience with similar operations 
existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence 
negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses  projections of future losses  or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income 
deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances  resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance 
tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold 
otherwise  these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled  which means that the statute of limitation has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed their examination even though the statute of limitations remains open 
interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized 
the company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to related party transactions we buy products from and sell products to various related companies  consisting of entities in which the company retains a or less equity interest  at negotiated arms length prices between the two parties 
litigation matters for asserted claims and assessments  liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable 
management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as the nature of the matter  available defenses and case strategy  progress of the matter  views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors  applicability and success of appeals processes  and the outcome of similar historical matters  among others 
once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable  management weighs the probability of estimated losses  and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded 
if an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible  but not probable  then the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded 
with respect to unasserted claims or assessments  management must first determine that the probability that an assertion will be made is likely  then  a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made 
legal matters are reviewed on a continuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management s judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss 
foreign currency the consolidated financial statements are presented in our reporting currency  us dollars 
the functional currency for the subsidiaries in china is the chinese yuan or rmb 
accordingly  the balance sheet of the chinese subsidiaries is translated into us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rates in effect during the period 
translation differences are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as foreign currency translation 
gains or losses on transactions denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries functional currency which arise as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates are recorded as foreign exchange gain or loss in the statements of operations 
recently adopted in may   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us and international accounting principles 
overall  the guidance is consistent with existing us accounting principles  however  there are some amendments that change a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
other than the additional disclosure requirements see note the adoption of this guidance had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb amended existing guidance and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholder s equity 
the amendment requires that comprehensive income be presented in either a single continuous statement or in two separate consecutive statements 
management elected to present the two statement option 
other than the change in presentation  the adoption of these changes had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
issued in december  the fasb issued changes to the disclosure of offsetting assets and liabilities 
these changes require an entity to disclose both gross information and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the enhanced disclosures will enable users of an entity s financial statements to understand and evaluate the effect or potential effect of master netting arrangements on an entity s financial position  including the effect or potential effect of rights of setoff associated with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
these changes become effective for the company on january  other than the additional disclosure requirements  management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued changes to the information provided about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
these changes require an entity to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required under us gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
these changes become effective for the company on january  management has determined that the adoption of these changes will not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the chinese yuan relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
all other international sales were denominated in us dollars 
certain of our expenses for the year ended december  were also denominated in foreign currencies  which partially offset risks associated with fluctuations of exchange rates between foreign currencies on the one hand  and the us dollar on the other hand 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between the chinese yuan and the us dollar resulted in a decrease in our gross revenues of approximately  and a decrease in our assets of approximately
