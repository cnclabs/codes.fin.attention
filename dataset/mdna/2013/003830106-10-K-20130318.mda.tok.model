item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion excludes the operations of blue eagle  except our equity share of blue eagle s income loss 
the blue eagle joint venture was dissolved effective august  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements and supplementary data in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation  development and production of oil and gas in the united states and canada 
historically  we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploitation of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a number of development opportunities on our properties 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
success in our development and exploration activities is critical in the maintenance and growth of our current production levels and associated reserves 
while we have attained positive net income in two of the last five years  there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following commodity prices and the effectiveness of our hedging arrangements  the level of total sales volumes of oil and gas  the availability of and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet cash flow needs  
table of contents the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging arrangements 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are dependent upon spot market prices  differentials and the effectiveness of our derivative contracts  which we sometimes refer to as hedging arrangements 
substantially all of our sales of oil and gas are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our oil and gas production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
significant declines in prices for oil and gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
the prices of oil and gas have been volatile 
during  the price of oil decreased from the levels experienced in the new york mercantile exchange nymex price for west texas intermediate crude oil wti averaged per barrel in as compared to per barrel in during  the average price of gas decreased from an average nymex henry hub spot price of per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in prices closed on december  at per bbl of oil and per mmbtu of gas 
if commodity prices decline  our revenue and cash flow from operations will also likely decline 
in addition  lower commodity prices could also reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
if gas prices remain depressed or oil prices decline significantly  our revenues  profitability and cash flow from operations may decrease which could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our drilling activities 
the realized prices that we receive for our production differ from nymex futures and spot market prices  principally due to basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location  adjustments for btu content  and gathering  processing and transportation costs 

table of contents the following table sets forth our average differentials for the years ended december   and oil gas average realized price average nymex price differential our hedging arrangements equate to approximately of the estimated oil production from our net proved developed producing reserves as of december  through december   in  in and for by removing a significant portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production  we believe we will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations for those periods 
however  when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices  we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged 
we have in the past and will in the future sustain realized and unrealized losses on our derivative contracts if market prices are higher than our contract prices 
conversely  when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains on our commodity derivative contracts 
in  we incurred a realized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million 
in  we incurred a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million 
we have not designated any of these derivative contracts as a hedge as prescribed by applicable accounting rules 
the following table sets forth the summary position of our derivative contracts at december  oil contract periods daily volume bbl swap price per bbl at december   the aggregate fair market value of our commodity derivative contracts was a liability of approximately million 
on march   we monetized our gas derivative contracts for million 
production volumes 
our proved reserves will decline as oil and gas is produced  unless we find  acquire or develop additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve estimates as of december   our average annual estimated decline rate for net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years  and approximately thereafter 
these rates of decline are estimates and actual production declines could be materially higher 
while we have had some success in finding  acquiring and developing additional reserves  we have not always been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploration and development projects 
we had capital expenditures during of million related to our exploration and development activities 
we have a capital expenditure budget for of million 
approximately of the budget will be spent on unconventional horizontal oil wells in the bakken three forks and niobrara plays in the rocky mountain region  approximately in the eagle ford shale play in south texas with the remainder targeting conventional oil plays in the permian basin region and in the province of alberta  canada 
the capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and crews  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas  the availability of sufficient capital resources  the results of our exploitation efforts  and our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations 
the following table presents historical net production volumes for the years ended december   and year ended december  total production mboe average daily production boepd oil ngl availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital are cash flow from operating activities  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  monetizing of derivative instruments  and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  the sale of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete any financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
as of december   we had approximately million of availability under our credit facility 
borrowings and interest 
at december   we had a total of million outstanding under our credit facility 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon 
table of contents the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure  we entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to fix our floating libor based debt 
the two year interest rate swap for million at a fixed rate of originally expired on august  the interest rate swap was amended in february lowering our fixed rate to 
the interest rate swap was further amended in november  lowering our fixed rate to and extending the term through august  the interest rate swap expired in august exploration and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
at december   we operated properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
we have identified numerous additional drilling locations on our existing leaseholds  the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our production and proved reserves 
over the five years ended december   we drilled or participated in gross net wells of which were commercially productive 
our future oil and gas production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our oil and gas properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production may also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility may also decline 
in addition  approximately of our estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
results of operations selected operating data

operating income includes a proved property impairment of million and million in and  respectively related to our canadian properties 

table of contents comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue increased to million from million in the increase in revenue was due to higher oil and ngl sales volumes in as compared to  which were partially offset by lower gas sales volumes and lower realized commodity prices 
overall boe sales in increased approximately as compared to increased oil and ngl sales volumes contributed million to operating revenue while decreased gas sales volumes had a negative impact of million 
lower commodity prices had a negative impact on operating revenue of million 
oil sales volumes increased to mbbls for the year ended december  from mbbls for the same period of the increase in oil sales volumes was due to new production brought on line in new wells brought onto production in contributed mbbls to production for the year ended december   offset by natural field declines 
gas sales volumes decreased to  mmcf for the year ended december from  mmcf for the year ended december  the decrease in gas production was due to natural field declines and the timing of new wells being brought on line  as well as our emphasis on drilling oil wells as opposed to gas wells 
new wells brought onto production during contributed mmcf to production for the year ended december  due to weak gas prices  our focus was primarily on oil projects during ngl sales increased to mbbls for the year ended december  from mbbls for the same period of the increase in ngl sales was primarily due to increased gas production in west texas  wyoming and north dakota that has a higher ngl content than our historical gas production 
lease operating expenses loe 
loe for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the increase in loe was primarily due to increased cost of services  and significant non recurring loe related to our canadian operations

table of contents loss gain on derivative contracts 
realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts as prescribed by asc  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contracts are recognized in earnings during the current period 
our derivative contracts consist of commodity swaps and interest rate swaps 
the net estimated value of our commodity derivative contracts was a liability of approximately million as of december  when our derivative contract prices are higher than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized gains and conversely  when our derivative contract prices are lower than prevailing market prices  we incur realized and unrealized losses 
for the year ended december   we realized a loss on our derivative contracts of approximately million  which included a realized loss of approximately million on our commodity swaps and a realized loss of approximately million on our interest rate swap 
for the year ended december   we incurred an unrealized gain of million on our commodity swaps 
we monetized our gas derivative contracts in march for million 
our interest rate swap expired in august the estimated value of our derivative contracts was an asset of approximately million as of december  for the year ended december   we realized a loss on our derivative contracts of approximately million  which included a realized gain of million on our commodity swaps and a realized loss of million on our interest rate swap

ceiling limitation write down 
we record the carrying value of our oil and gas properties using the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore for and develop oil and gas properties 
under the full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less related deferred taxes  are limited by country  to the lower of the unamortized cost or the cost ceiling  defined as the sum of the present value of estimated unescalated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the costs being amortized  if any  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties exceeds the ceiling limit  we are subject to a ceiling limitation write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling limitation write down is a charge to earnings which does not impact cash flow from operating activities 
however  such write downs do impact the amount of our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
as of december   our net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties in the united states and canada did not exceed the present value of our estimated proved reserves 
as of december   the net capitalized cost of our oil and gas properties in the united states did not exceed the present value of our estimated proved reserves  however in canada  the net capitalized cost exceeded the present value of our estimated proved reserves by million  resulting in a write down of million 
there were write downs in the second  third and fourth quarters of of million  million and million respectively 
the year end amount was calculated in accordance with sec rules utilizing the twelve month first day of the month average oil and gas prices for the year ended which were per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas as adjusted to reflect the expected realized prices for our oil and gas reserves 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas assets increases when oil and gas prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we have substantial downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience additional write downs in the future 
if commodity prices decline or if any of our proved reserves are revised downward  a further write down of the carrying value of our oil and gas properties may be required 
equity in income loss of joint venture 
we accounted for blue eagle under the equity method of accounting 
under this method  abraxas share of net income loss from the joint venture was reflected as an increase decrease in its investment account in investment in joint venture and is also recorded as equity investment income loss in equity in loss income of joint venture 
for the year ended december   our net share of the joint venture s income was million 
the joint venture was dissolved on september   effective august   with the assets being distributed to the joint venture partners 
the dissolution of the joint venture was accounted for with the net investment in the joint venture being added to our full cost pool 
for the year ended december  through august   we reported income of million related to blue eagle

liquidity and capital resources general 
the oil and gas industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following the development and exploration of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  
table of contents acquisition of interests in additional oil and gas properties  and production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our principal sources of capital are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  and if an opportunity presents itself  the sale of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete any financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
working capital deficit 
at december   our current liabilities of million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million at december  current assets at december  primarily consist of cash of million  and accounts receivable of million 
current liabilities at december  primarily consist of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties of million and the current portion of derivative liabilities of million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures year ended december  in thousands expenditure category acquisition of producing properties exploration development facilities and other total during capital expenditures were primarily for the development of our existing properties 
during  capital expenditures were for the development of our existing properties  the purchase and refurbishment of a drilling rig  and the purchase of  acres of land surface only in our portilla field in san patricio county  texas 
during our expenditures were primarily for development of our existing properties  the acquisition of producing properties in west texas and the completion of the refurbishment of our drilling rig 
we anticipate making capital expenditures in of million 
the capital expenditure budget is subject to change depending upon a number of factors  including the availability and costs of drilling and service equipment and crews  economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling  prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and gas  the availability of sufficient capital resources  and our ability to obtain permits for drilling locations 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for the acquisition of producing properties  if such opportunities arise 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on economic and industry conditions and commodity prices 
should the prices of oil and gas decline and if our costs of operations increase or if our production volumes decrease  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditure budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditure budget  we may not be able to offset oil and gas production decreases caused by natural field declines 

table of contents sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities total operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
non cash expense items  net changes in operating assets and liabilities  including the non cash property impairment of million  and the monetization of our gas derivatives accounted for most of these funds 
investing activities used million  primarily for the development of our oil and gas properties  acquisition of producing properties  and the completion of the refurbishment of our drilling rig offset by the sale of producing properties 
financing activities used million primarily for the reduction of long term debt 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december  which was primarily from the net proceeds from our equity offering in february of million offset by a net reduction in our long term debt 
investing activities used million in for the development of our oil and gas properties  the purchase and reconditioning of a drilling rig and the purchase of  acres of land surface only in our portilla field in san patricio county  texas 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash 
net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds  including the non cash property impairment of million 
financing activities used million for the year ended december  which was predominately the reduction of long term debt 
investing activities used million in for the development of our oil and gas properties  net of proceeds from sale of properties of million 
future capital resources 
our principal sources of capital going forward are cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  and if an opportunity presents itself  the sale of debt or equity securities  although we may not be able to complete financing on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
cash from operating activities is dependent upon commodity prices and production volumes 
a decrease in commodity prices from current levels could reduce our cash flows from operations 
this could cause us to alter our business plans  including reducing our exploration and development plans 
unless we otherwise expand and develop reserves  our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced 
in the future we may continue to sell producing properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify and develop additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil and gas reservoirs will be found 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facility will also decline 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were classified as undeveloped 
we have in the past  and may in the future  sell producing properties 
most recently  in the third quarter of  we sold certain non core assets for combined net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility and general corporate purposes 

table of contents we have also sold debt and equity securities in the past when the opportunity has presented itself 
on february   we closed a public offering of million shares of common stock of which million shares were sold by certain selling stockholders at a public offering price of per share for total net proceeds to us of approximately million  after fees and expenses 
contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements long term debt  and operating leases for office facilities 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in twelve month periods ending contractual obligations in thousands total december  december  december  thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt lease obligations total these amounts represent the balances outstanding under our credit facility  the rig loan agreement and the real estate lien note 
these payments assume that we will not borrow additional funds 
interest expense assumes the balances of long term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rates 
lease on office space in calgary  alberta  which expires on january  and office space in dickinson  north dakota  which expires on august  we maintain a reserve for costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
at december   our reserve for these obligations totaled million for which no contractual commitments exist 
for additional information relating to this obligation  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have  or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
at december   we were not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on us 
other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of oil and gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  cash on hand  proceeds from the sale of properties  sales of debt and equity securities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion

this amount will remain in effect until the next redetermination of the borrowing base which is scheduled to be completed in april the borrowing base is determined semi annually by the lenders based upon our reserve reports  one of which must be prepared by our independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally 
the amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves securing the facility utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions 
in addition  the lenders  in their sole discretion  are able to make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations and we are able to request one redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations 
the borrowing base will be automatically reduced in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of or more of our then current borrowing base and in connection with any hedge termination which could reduce the collateral value by or more 
our borrowing base was increased to million based upon our reserve report dated june  and did not include any of the properties held for sale

hedging activities our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
we have entered into commodity swaps on approximately of our estimated oil production from our net proved developed producing reserves as of december  through december   for  for and for the following table sets forth the summary position of our derivative contracts as of december  oil contract periods daily volume bbl swap price per bbl by removing a significant portion of price volatility on our future oil and gas production  we believe that we will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity prices on our cash flow from operations 
however  when prevailing market prices are higher than our contract prices  we will not realize increased cash flow on the portion of the production that has been hedged 
we have sustained  and in the future will sustain  realized and unrealized losses on our derivative contracts when market prices are higher than our contract prices 
conversely  when prevailing market prices are lower than our contract prices  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains on our commodity derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we incurred a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million on our commodity derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we incurred a realized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million on our commodity derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we incurred a realized gain of million and an unrealized gain of million on our commodity derivative contracts 
if the disparity between our contract prices and market prices continues  we will sustain realized and unrealized gains or losses on our derivative contracts 
while unrealized gains and losses do not impact our cash flow from operations  realized gains and losses do impact our cash flow from operations 
in addition  as our derivative contracts expire over time  we expect to enter into new derivative contracts at then current market prices 
if the prices at which we hedge future production are significantly lower than our existing derivative contracts  our future cash flow from operations would likely be materially lower 
in addition  borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
on march   we monetized our gas derivative contracts for million

the company and abraxas energy partners  lp  which was merged into a wholly owned subsidiary of abraxas  have undergone an audit of their federal income tax returns 
the audit of the federal income tax return of abraxas energy partners  lp was completed with no changes 
the audit of abraxas petroleum corporation resulted in a notice of proposed adjustment of  the company does not agree with the findings and intends to aggressively appeal the proposed adjustment  however  no assurances can be made that such appeals will be successful 
for the year ended december   the company accrued  in income tax expense related to the recent audit of its federal tax return 
this amount was determined by an analysis of what the amount that is greater than likely to be paid upon final settlement 
related party transactions we have adopted a policy that transactions between us and our officers  directors  principal stockholders  or affiliates of any of them  will be on terms no less favorable to us than can be obtained on an arm s length basis in transactions with third parties and must be approved by our audit committee

environmental regulations various federal  provincial  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect our operations and costs as a result of their effect on oil and gas exploration  development and production operations 
these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including oil  into the environment 
in addition  we have acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control  and under environmental laws and regulations  we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
we also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal or to which we sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
in addition  we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which we own an interest but are not the operator 
moreover  we are subject to the epa s rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business  but has not had  to date  a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations or competitive position 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts whether for environmental control facilities or otherwise that are material in relation to our total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with such laws and regulations  but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance or the effect on our operations  financial condition  results of operations and competitive position 

table of contents we are aware of the increasing focus of local  state  national and international regulatory bodies on ghg emissions and climate change issues 
in addition to the epa rule requiring annual reporting of ghg emissions  we are also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers to reduce ghg emissions 
we are unable to predict the timing  scope and effect of any such proposed laws  regulations and treaties  but the direct and indirect costs of such laws  regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and competitive position 
we strive to reduce ghg emissions throughout our operations which is in the best interest of the environment and a generally good business practice 
we will continue to review the risks to our business and operations associated with all environmental matters  including climate change 
in addition  we will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities but do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our oil and gas properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in the current year  relating to our proved oil and gas properties in canada 
our oil and gas reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from impairment testing procedures associated with the full cost method of accounting as discussed below 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  less related deferred taxes  may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a pool by pool basis  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices are depressed 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
we apply the full cost ceiling test on a quarterly basis on the date of the latest balance sheet presented 

table of contents estimates of proved oil and gas reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on studies performed by our independent petroleum engineers assisted by the engineering and operations departments of abraxas 
reserve estimates were made by our independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on costs on the date of the estimate and for the years ended december   and  oil and gas prices were based on the average month first day of the month pricing as compared to end of period prices utilized in prior years 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs used in the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and we amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
accounting for derivatives 
realized derivative gains or losses are determined by actual derivative settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of derivative contracts in place 
the derivative instruments we utilize are based on index prices that may and often do differ from the actual oil and gas prices realized in our operations 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts as prescribed by asc  as a result  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contract are recognized in earnings during the current period 
our derivative contracts consist of commodity swaps and interest rate swaps 
due to the volatility of oil and gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and  the net market value of our commodity derivatives was a net asset of million and a net liability of million  respectively 
the market value of our interest rate derivative was a liability of million at december  our interest rate derivative expired in august share based payments 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
additional information about management s assumptions can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
restricted stock awards are awards of common stock that are subject to restrictions on transfer and to a risk of forfeiture if the awardee terminates employment with the company prior to the lapse of the restrictions 
the value of such stock is determined using the market price on the grant date and expense is recognized over the vesting period 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 

table of contents equity method investment 
our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture  in which we did not have a majority interest  was accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of net income loss from our equity investment was reflected as an increase decrease in our investment account investment in joint venture and was also recorded as equity in loss income of joint venture in other income expense 
the joint venture was dissolved effective august  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent oil and gas producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of oil and gas 
declines in commodity prices will adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global  political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for our oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indices fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in oil and gas prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year  however  due to the derivative contracts that we have in place  it is unlikely that a decline in commodity prices from their current levels would significantly impact our operating revenue  cash flow and net income 
derivative instrument sensitivity we account for our derivative contracts in accordance with asc the derivative instruments we utilize are based on index prices that may and often do differ from the actual oil and gas prices realized in our operations 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts as prescribed by asc  as a result  fluctuations in the market value of the derivative contract are recognized in earnings during the current period 
the following table sets forth the summary position of our derivative contracts as of december  oil contract periods daily volume bbl swap price per bbl in order to mitigate our interest rate exposure  we entered into an interest rate swap  effective august   to fix our floating libor based debt
