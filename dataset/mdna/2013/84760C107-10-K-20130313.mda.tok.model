corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system 
our products are used to access and treat arterial blockages in the legs and heart and to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads 
during the year ended december   approximately of our disposable product revenue was from products used in connection with our proprietary excimer laser system  the cvx 
our single use laser catheters contain up to small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures

table of contents financial results by geographical segment our two operating segments consist of united states medical  which includes the united states and canada  and international medical  which includes europe  the middle east  asia pacific  latin america and puerto rico 
united states medical also includes all costs for our corporate headquarters  research and development  and corporate administrative functions 
the international medical segment is engaged primarily in distribution activities  with no local manufacturing or product development functions 
for the years ended december   and  a portion of research and development and general and administrative costs incurred in the us has been allocated to international medical based on a percentage of revenue  because these costs support our ability to generate revenue in the international segment

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  on a constant currency basis  total revenue increased compared with the previous year see the non gaap financial measures section below for a discussion of our use of the constant currency financial measure 
all of the million revenue increase was in disposables product revenue  partially offset by a decrease in laser and service revenue 
this resulted in a slight change in our product mix year over year  with disposable products generating of revenue in compared with in service and other revenue decreased to of total revenue in compared with in revenue from laser equipment sales and rentals decreased to of total revenue in compared with in vascular intervention vi revenue  which includes products used in both the peripheral and coronary vascular systems  increased on a constant currency basis in compared with vi sales include three product categories peripheral atherectomy  which increased  crossing solutions  which increased  and coronary atherectomy and thrombus management  which decreased  all compared with increased peripheral atherectomy product sales were primarily related to higher sales to office based physician clinics in the us  which provide increased access for patients at a potentially lower cost to the healthcare system 
in addition  we believe that our peripheral artery disease pad awareness program contributed to the increase in us peripheral atherectomy sales 
the growth in crossing solutions product sales was due to increased unit volumes despite a larger number of competitors 
coronary atherectomy and thrombus management are not currently a strategic priority for us  which is reflected in the decrease in revenue 
in addition  our quickcat product faced pricing pressures due to increased competition  and we have made the decision to discontinue sale of our thromcat product  which totaled million for the year ended december  lead management lm revenue  which includes excimer laser sheaths and cardiac lead management accessories for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads  grew on a constant currency basis in as compared with in the second quarter of  we initiated a launch of glidelight  our next generation lead extraction tool  and by year end approximately of our customers had been converted from its predecessor  the sls ii 
approximately two thirds of the increase in lm revenue related to the sls ii glidelight lead extraction laser sheaths was attributable to increased volumes  the remaining one third was due to the higher average selling price of glidelight compared to the sls ii 
we believe the volume increases are primarily a result of an expanding market for lead extractions due to increasing infection rates and increased indications for lead extraction set forth by the heart rhythm society 
we believe clinical data  including results from the four year lead extraction in contemporary settings lexicon study published in february  supports the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads 
in addition  we received reimbursement approval in japan for the lld lead locking device in april  which allowed us to make available our complete lead management system in japan 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
laser equipment revenue decreased to million in from million in equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  decreased as compared with we sold laser systems in compared with in rental revenue decreased in as compared with the prior year  primarily because higher disposables purchases by certain customers under volume based rental agreements led to lower rent due 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements in  laser systems were direct transfers from the existing installed base or were deployments of remanufactured lasers from our factory compared with transfers remanufactured systems in 
table of contents the new placements brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to  in the us at december   compared to  in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the us was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue was million  an increase of from and an increase of on a constant currency basis 
the increase in international revenue was primarily due to an increase in international lm revenue and crossing solutions revenue  primarily in europe and japan 
gross margin in was compared with in and in the increase was due to a combination of changes in product mix  improved pricing from our glidelight product  improved manufacturing efficiencies and higher production volumes 
our net revenue increase over the prior year was due to increased disposable product revenue  which carries a significantly higher gross margin percentage than laser equipment or service revenue 
operating expenses operating expenses were million in  an increase of from million in operating expenses represented of total revenue in both and operating expenses in included million of acquisition related costs and in included million of litigation and settlement costs which are separately disclosed components within operating expenses in our statement of comprehensive income loss  further described below 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased compared with as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses increased to of revenue in compared with in within sg a  marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  year over year  due primarily to the following a million increase in vi and lm marketing expense  primarily due to the hiring of pad awareness managers in selected vi sales territories  whose objective is to increase awareness of pad in the communities they serve  the expansion of our marketing capabilities to include strategy and product portfolio management and costs associated with the launch of the glidelight lead extraction laser sheath and increased marketing and physician training events 
a million increase in vi  lm and international field sales expense  primarily due to increased incentive compensation on higher revenue and additional field sales positions 
also within sg a  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  with increased personnel expenses primarily due to the hiring of our chief executive officer in august and other senior executives in and  an increase in stock compensation expense  an increase in outside consulting costs associated with regulatory compliance and an increase in company wide performance based incentive compensation expense tied to achievement of goals established at the beginning of the year 
research  development and other technology 
research  development and other technology expenses of million in decreased million  or  from million in as a percentage of revenue  research  development and other technology expenses decreased to of revenue in from of revenue in costs included within research  development and other technology expenses are product development costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
we expect these expenses to increase as a percentage of revenue in as we increase headcount and otherwise expand our overall product development activities 
fluctuations in these costs were as follows 
table of contents royalty expenses decreased by million compared with due to the termination of a royalty agreement in the first quarter of  slightly offset by increases in ongoing royalties paid based on increased sales of products incorporating licensed technology  product development costs decreased by million compared with due to a temporary decrease in project activity  as project teams transitioned from completed projects to new projects  and clinical studies costs increased by approximately million compared with primarily due to costs related to the excite isr trial 
acquisition related costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred million in legal and other costs related to our acquisition of products from upstream peripheral technologies ltd 
on january  the base purchase price of the acquisition was million with additional future milestone payments based on product and manufacturing transfer and one third of revenues for  and we expect the upstream acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination and we will record the assets acquired and the estimated future contingent consideration at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date during the first quarter of in and beyond  we expect to incur additional intangible asset amortization and contingent consideration expense accretion of the contingent consideration liability related to the products acquired  which we estimate in the range of million million in see note  subsequent event acquisition  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of this matter 
federal investigation legal and accrued indemnification costs 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reduction in our accrual for indemnification costs to reflect a change in our estimate of the range of our contingent liability for indemnification obligations we have to three former employees related to a federal investigation 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of this matter 
settlement costs license agreement dispute 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a license agreement which was executed in january royalty expenses paid or accrued under the license agreement for the year ended december  were approximately million  royalty expenses were not incurred subsequent to the effective date of the termination agreement 
see note  settlement costs license agreement dispute  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of this matter 
litigation charge 
we were engaged in a dispute since with cardiomedica 
in  a dutch court issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay million  which ruling cardiomedica appealed 
in september  the dutch court of appeals issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica an additional million in damages plus million in interest 
we paid and expensed this amount in september other income expense 
in  other expense included litigation related interest expense of million 
as discussed above  in september  the dutch court of appeals issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica million for lost profits plus million in interest 
we paid and expensed this amount in september other items within other income expense include interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are primarily due to the cash settlement in dollars of intercompany transactions with our dutch subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 

table of contents income before income taxes pre tax income for the year ended december  was million  compared with pre tax income of million for the year ended december  the current year results included million of acquisition related costs  and the prior year results included million of litigation and settlement costs  as described above 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million in  which included approximately million of currently payable income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and million of state income taxes currently payable for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded deferred federal and state tax expense of million representing a deferred tax liability related to the difference between book and tax accounting for our goodwill  which is amortized over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets including our us net operating losses  and therefore we did not incur current us federal tax expense against our pretax income during the year ended december  our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations 
due to our history of losses and the lack of sufficient certainty of generating future taxable income  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  as we continue to believe there is sufficient uncertainty surrounding the realization of our us deferred tax assets through future taxable income 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
in the event there is a change in circumstances in the future which would affect the utilization of our deferred tax assets  the tax provision in that period would be adjusted by the amount of the assets then deemed to be realizable 
we do not expect to reduce the valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets to below of its gross amount until we have a sufficient historical trend of taxable income and can predict future income with a higher degree of certainty 
because we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our effective tax rate is currently lower than it would be if there were no valuation allowance 
see note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of our income tax provision 
net income we recorded net income for the year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per fully diluted share  for the year ended december  functional currency the functional currency of spectranetics international bv  spectranetics deutschland gmbh and spectranetics austria gmbh is the euro 
all revenue and expenses are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average exchange rates during the year 
fluctuations in currency rates during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  caused a decrease in consolidated revenue of approximately million and a decrease in consolidated net income of approximately million

table of contents revenue and gross margin revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of as compared with million for the year ended december  of the million revenue increase  approximately was in disposables product revenue and was in laser and service revenue 
this resulted in a slight change in our product mix year over year  with disposables products generating of revenue in compared with in service and other revenue remained stable at of total revenue in both years 
revenue from laser equipment sales and rentals increased to of total revenue in compared with in vi revenue increased in compared with vi sales include three product categories peripheral atherectomy  which increased  crossing solutions  which were flat year over year  and coronary atherectomy and thrombus management  which increased  all compared with increased peripheral atherectomy product sales were primarily related to higher sales to stand alone physician clinics  which provide increased access for patients at a potentially lower cost to the healthcare system 
crossing solutions product sales were flat year over year  in spite of increased competition 
the increase in coronary atherectomy and thrombus management revenue was primarily due to increased coronary atherectomy product sales  due primarily to increased use of our products within existing accounts  partially offset by a reduction in sales of the thromcat xt catheter in europe  due to a greater focus on products with higher sales volumes 
lm revenue grew in as compared with we believe our lm revenue continues to increase primarily as a result of an expanding market for lead extractions due to increasing infection rates and increased indications for lead extraction set forth by the heart rhythm society 
we believe clinical data  including results from the four year lexicon study published in february  supports the safety and efficacy of removing pacemaker and defibrillator leads 
in addition  we received reimbursement approval in japan for the lld lead locking device in april  which allowed us to make available our complete lead management system in japan 
this resulted in a significant increase in lm revenue in japan 
service and other revenue increased  to million in from million in  due primarily to our increased installed base of laser systems 
laser equipment revenue increased to million in from million in equipment sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  increased from we sold laser systems in compared with in rental revenue decreased in as compared with the prior year  with increased revenue from straight rentals offset by a decrease in cap free fee per procedure revenue 
we placed laser systems with new customers during compared with during the prior year 
of those new laser placements  laser systems were transfers from the existing installed base in compared with transfers in in recent quarters  we have placed more focus on redeploying laser systems from hospitals with low laser based catheter utilization to hospitals or offices where we believe utilization will be higher  in order to increase productivity per laser system 
the new placements brought our worldwide installed base of laser systems to  in the us at december   compared to in the us at december  on a geographic basis  revenue in the united states was million in  an increase of from the prior year 
international revenue was million  an increase of from the increase in international revenue was due to increases in both vi and lm disposables and laser equipment revenue 
we recorded nine international laser system sales in compared with six laser system sales in fluctuations in foreign exchange rates also contributed million to the revenue increase compared with 
table of contents gross margin in was compared with in the increase was due to a combination of changes in product mix and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
our revenue increase in included a higher percentage of laser disposables  which carry higher gross margins than non laser catheters  as compared with the prior year 
margins can fluctuate based on a number of factors  including manufacturing efficiencies and product mix 
operating expenses operating expenses were million in  a decrease of from million in operating expenses represented of total revenue in as compared with of total revenue in operating expenses in and included a number of items which are separately disclosed components within operating expenses in our statement of operations 
in  these items totaled million  compared with million in  and they are further described below 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in compared with as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses decreased to of revenue in compared with in within sg a  marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  year over year  due primarily to the following a million increase in vi and lm marketing expense  due to new hires and increased marketing and training events  a million increase in international sales expense due in part to new hires  increased performance based incentive compensation and a million impact of foreign currency fluctuations

research  development and other technology 
research  development and other technology expenses were approximately million in  an increase of from million in as a percentage of revenue  research  development and other technology costs increased to of revenue in from of revenue in  due to our investments primarily in new product development projects and the excite isr clinical trial 
costs included in research  development and other technology expenses are product development costs  clinical studies costs and royalty costs associated with various license agreements with third party licensors 
fluctuations in these costs were as follows product development and related regulatory costs increased approximately million compared with due to an increase in headcount and in materials expenses related to new product development projects  clinical studies expense increased by approximately million due primarily to costs associated with the excite isr clinical trial  and royalty expenses increased by approximately million due to higher sales of products incorporating technology that we license 
federal investigation legal and accrued indemnification costs 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a million charge to accrue the low end of our estimate of the range of our contingent liability for indemnification 
table of contents obligations we had to three former employees who were indicted on charges related to a federal investigation 
in addition  in  we had million of legal costs associated with the federal investigation 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reduction in our accrual for indemnification costs to reflect a change in our estimate 
we estimated that our total costs in these matters would total approximately million as compared with the original million estimate 
the million adjustment to our accrual reduced the remaining liability as of december  to approximately million  which was paid during the actual expenses may be higher or lower than the estimate depending upon final resolution of the proceedings 
factors that may cause us to increase the accrual include but are not limited to the success or failure of an appeal  and in particular  a successful appeal that results in the order of a new trial 
see note  commitments and contingencies  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report for further discussion of this matter 
settlement costs license agreement dispute 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a license agreement because the underlying cause of the dispute and likelihood of a settlement to resolve such dispute existed as of december  in january  we terminated a license agreement  dated february  with medtronic  inc in  the parties disputed whether royalties were owed under the license agreement 
under a termination agreement  we paid medtronic million in january in settlement of all obligations under the license agreement  and neither party has any further rights or obligations under the license agreement 
we had accrued royalty expenses in the amount of million prior to the termination settlement  therefore  we recorded the million charge as settlement costs license agreement dispute in our financial statements for the quarter ended december  see note  settlement costs license agreement dispute  of the consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of this matter 
litigation charge 
we were engaged in a dispute since with cardiomedica

in september  the dutch court of appeals issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica an additional million in damages plus million in interest 
we paid and expensed this amount in september employee termination costs 
in the third quarter of  we terminated employees  primarily within the vascular intervention sales organization  as a result of a strategic re alignment of certain sales territories designed to improve sales productivity 
as a result  we recorded severance obligations totaling million in the third quarter of effective november   an executive retired from his positions as chairman  president  and chief executive officer 
in connection with his retirement and release of claims  we paid the executive million  equal to one year s salary  which was the amount payable under his employment agreement in connection with termination of his employment 
in addition  outstanding stock options held by the executive to purchase  shares of our common stock became fully vested in accordance with their terms  resulting in non cash stock compensation expense of million 
these amounts  along with certain health insurance premiums  were recorded in the three months ended december  asset impairment charge 
in the third quarter of  we wrote off a capital project in process that was no longer expected to be completed and used  due to an epa ruling that effectively limited the useful life of the asset 
other income expense 
in  other expense included litigation related interest expense of million 
as discussed above  in september  the dutch court of appeals issued a ruling in favor of cardiomedica  requiring us to pay to cardiomedica million for lost profits plus million in interest 
we paid and expensed this amount in september other items within other income expense include interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are primarily due to the cash settlement in dollars of intercompany transactions with our dutch subsidiary  whose functional currency is the euro 

table of contents income loss before income taxes pre tax income for the year ended december  was million  compared with a pre tax loss of million for the year ended december  the current year results included million of litigation and settlement costs  and the prior year results included million of litigation costs and impairment charges  as described above 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million in this was primarily the result of taxes currently payable in state and foreign jurisdictions as well as deferred tax expense arising from net deferred tax liabilities after consideration of the substantial valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
income tax expense in included approximately million of income tax expense in foreign jurisdictions and million of state income taxes currently payable for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded deferred federal and state tax expense of million representing a deferred tax liability related to the difference between book and tax accounting for our goodwill  which is amortized over years for tax purposes but not amortized for book purposes 
the remainder of our tax nols in the netherlands expired unutilized at the end of however  prior to expiration we entered into a strategic tax transaction with the approval of the dutch tax authority which allowed spectranetics international bv bv to sell its assets including goodwill to a newly created subsidiary of bv 
the transaction allowed bv to offset the gain from the sale of the assets with a portion of its nol prior to expiration 
the new subsidiary will be allowed to amortize the tax basis goodwill over ten years for tax purposes 
we therefore recorded a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of representing our estimate of the actual utilization of the extended tax deduction in future years 
in  we increased our valuation allowance against our us deferred tax asset to 
the effect of the valuation allowance adjustment was to increase our provision for income taxes by million for the year ended december  events in  primarily the third quarter indictment of former employees  the related million accrual for indemnification costs for these employees  and the possibility that such costs could exceed the estimated accrual  caused us to conclude that we no longer met the accounting criteria for recognizing a portion of our deferred tax asset 
income tax expense also included approximately  comprised of state and foreign income taxes payable for the year ended december  net income loss we recorded net income for the year ended december  of million  or per fully diluted share  compared with a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  functional currency the functional currency of spectranetics international bv  spectranetics deutschland gmbh and spectranetics austria gmbh is the euro 
all revenue and expenses are translated to us dollars in the consolidated statements of operations using weighted average exchange rates during the year 
fluctuations in currency rates during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  caused an increase in consolidated revenue of approximately million and an increase in consolidated net income of approximately million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  representing a decrease of million from million at december  during  we had the following significant uses of cash i million of milestone payments to kensey nash corporation knc in connection with a acquisition  recorded as goodwill  ii a million payment in settlement of all obligations under a terminated license agreement  which was accrued as of december   and iii approximately million of payments of our accrued indemnification obligations to former employees 
these items were non recurring payments 
during the first quarter of  we paid million in the acquisition of certain products from upstream peripheral technologies ltd 
we anticipate an additional milestone payment of million in the third or fourth quarter of in addition  we are also required to pay upstream one third of revenues of the acquired products for  and see further discussion of this matter in note  subsequent event acquisition  to our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  anticipated funds from operations and other sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future based on our expected level of operations 
however  we may need or seek additional funding earlier than anticipated 
in the event that we require additional working capital to fund future operations and any future acquisitions  we may access available borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank described below

these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those relating to the carrying amount of property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  allowances for receivables  inventories and deferred income tax assets  stock based compensation expense  accrued indemnification costs  estimated clinical trial expenses  accrued estimates for incurred but not reported claims under partially self insured employee health benefit programs  and loss contingencies  including those related to litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and the carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped to the customer and title transfers 
in general  customers do not have a right of return for credit or refund 
however  we allow returns under certain circumstances and record an allowance for sales returns based on an analysis of revenue transactions and historical experience of sales returns and price adjustments 
the allowance for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the systems 
our field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
we recognize revenue from fee for service arrangements upon completion of the related service 
we account for service provided during the one year warranty or service contract period as a separate unit of accounting in accordance with us gaap 
as such  we defer the fair value of this service and recognize it as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty or service contract period and warranty and service costs are expensed in the period they are incurred 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally include delivery and installation of the laser system 
in addition to the sale of laser systems  we also offer laser system placement programs  including flat rate rentals and variable depending on catheter purchases rentals for which we invoice the customer and recognize revenue on a monthly basis 
we also offer a cap free program under which the customer does not pay a rental fee  but agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
we recognize the total surcharge as rental revenue upon shipment of the catheters  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser system each month 
under the laser system placement programs  the laser system is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a five year expected life of the laser system 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 

table of contents we sell to end users in the united states and internationally as well as to certain international distributors 
sales to international distributors represented approximately of our total revenue in distributor agreements are in place with each distributor  which outline the significant terms of the transactions between the distributor and us 
the terms and conditions of sales to our international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
sales to distributors are recognized either at shipment or a later date in accordance with the agreed upon contract terms with distributors  provided that we have received an order  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  all contractual obligations have been met and we can reasonably estimate returns 
we provide products to our distributors at agreed wholesale prices and do not typically provide any special right of return or exchange  discounts  significant sales incentives  price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we use judgment in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an aging of accounts receivable  historical experience and the overall quality of the receivables 
we review individual accounts receivable balances for collectibility 
account balances are charged off against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is remote 
we believe our estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable are reasonable  however  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  significant additional allowances could be required 
inventory reserves 
we calculate an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or excess inventory based on historical usage and sales  as well as assumptions about future demand for our products 
we review and update our estimates for excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis 
the estimates we use for product demand are consistent with our sales forecasts and are also used for near term production planning and inventory purchasing 
increases in the inventory reserves result in a corresponding expense which is generally recorded to cost of goods sold 
we believe that our estimates for obsolete and excess inventory are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation 
however  other factors  such as future product introductions  the introduction of competing technologies or changes in market demand  may require additional reserves  which could have a material effect on gross margins in any given period 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which may involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using either the black scholes options pricing model or a trinomial lattice model  both of which require management s estimates and assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables including volatility  expected term of the options  and other inputs 
in recognizing stock based compensation expense  we also estimate future forfeitures based on historical forfeiture data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current and prior periods and could materially affect our results of operations 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
stock based compensation expense recognized for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to 
table of contents differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided to the extent it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
in and  we maintained a valuation allowance for substantially all of our deferred tax assets including our us net operating losses  due to the uncertainty about the realization of our us deferred tax assets 
see further discussion of our valuation allowance above under results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
management must use significant estimates and assumptions in evaluating whether or not impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets has occurred 
significant changes in these estimates and management s assumptions may reduce the carrying amount of these intangible assets 
clinical trial costs 
we sponsor clinical trials intended to obtain the necessary clinical data required to obtain approval from the fda and other foreign regulatory agencies to market new applications for our technology 
costs associated with these clinical trials totaled million  million and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred 
in certain cases  substantial portions of our clinical trials are performed by third party cros 
these cros generally bill monthly for services performed and additionally bill based upon milestone achievement 
milestone based cro fees are amortized to research and development expense over the period of time the contracted services required to earn milestone payments are performed  based upon the number of patients enrolled  patient months incurred and the duration of the study 
we monitor patient enrollment  the progress of clinical studies and related activities through internal reviews of data reported to us by the cros and correspondence with the cros 
our estimates depend on the timeliness and accuracy of the data provided by the cros regarding the status of the program and total program spending 
we periodically evaluate our estimates to determine if adjustments are necessary or appropriate based on information we receive 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate data  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change and our expenses in this area could fluctuate in future periods 
medical self insurance costs 
starting in october  we are partially self insured for certain claims relating to employee medical and dental benefit programs 
the medical self insurance program is administered by a third party and contains stop loss provisions on both an individual claim basis and in the aggregate 
we record claims incurred as an expense each period  including an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported which is revised quarterly 
we use claims data and historical experience  as applicable  to estimate liabilities for claims incurred but not yet reported 
we believe that our self insurance program accruals are adequate to cover future claims 
historical trends  however  may not be indicative of future claims  and revised estimates could significantly affect future expenses 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu comprehensive income  which amended guidance for presenting comprehensive income 
the 
table of contents amendment requires us to present the components of net income and comprehensive income either as one continuous statement or as two consecutive statements 
there is no longer the option to present items of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
the amended guidance was effective for us beginning january  on a retrospective basis  and we have elected to present the components of net income and comprehensive income as one continuous statement 
in july  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other  which updated guidance on the periodic testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test required under current accounting standards 
this guidance will be effective for us for the year ending december   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this guidance will not have an effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires an entity to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income either on the face of the statement where net income is presented  or as a separate disclosure in the notes to the financial statements 
the new disclosure requirements are prospective and will be effective for our fiscal year ending december   with early adoption permitted 
this update only requires additional disclosures  as such  the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  and the adoption of this guidance will not materially change the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have considered all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and do not believe that such pronouncements are of significance  or potential significance  to us 

table of contents non gaap financial measures to supplement our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap  we use certain non gaap financial measures in this report 
reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable us gaap measures for the respective periods can be found in the tables below 
an explanation of the manner in which our management uses these non gaap measures to conduct and evaluate our business and the reasons why management believes that these non gaap measures provide useful information to investors is provided following the reconciliation tables 
reconciliation of revenue by geography to non gaap revenue by geography on a constant currency basis s  except percentages unaudited year ended december  december  change revenue  as reported foreign exchange impact as compared to prior period revenue on a constant currency basis revenue  as reported as reported constant currency basis united states international total revenue reconciliation of revenue by product line to non gaap revenue by product line on a constant currency basis s  except percentages unaudited year ended december  december  change revenue  as reported foreign exchange impact as compared to prior period revenue on a constant currency basis revenue  as reported as reported constant currency basis vascular intervention lead management laser equipment  service other total revenue the impact of foreign exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict 
we use a constant currency basis to show the impact from foreign exchange rates on current period revenue compared to prior period revenue using the prior period s foreign exchange rates 
in order to properly understand the underlying business trends and 
table of contents performance of our ongoing operations  we believe that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from our revenue 
we believe that presenting the non gaap financial measures used in this report provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for financial and operational decision making and allows investors to see our results through the eyes of management 
we also believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance 
non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap 
for example  revenue growth rates stated on a constant currency basis  by their nature  exclude the impact of foreign exchange  which may have a material impact on us gaap revenue 
non gaap financial measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and therefore other companies may calculate similarly titled non gaap financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  primarily including foreign currency fluctuations 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is primarily related to sales of our products in europe  which are denominated primarily in the euro 
changes in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar could adversely affect our revenue and net income 
exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk may increase over time as our business evolves and our products continue to be introduced into international markets 
currently  we do not hedge against any foreign currencies and  as a result  we could incur gains or losses 
fluctuation in currency rates during the year ended december  as compared with the year ended december  caused a decrease in consolidated revenue of approximately million and a decrease in consolidated net income of approximately million 
based on our overall foreign currency exchange rate exposure as of december   a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar would have had a positive or negative impact on our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  of approximately million 
the current macroeconomic environment is highly volatile  and continuing instability in global markets  including the ongoing turmoil in europe related to sovereign debt issues and the stability of the euro  has contributed to a global economic downturn 
during the year ended december   of our revenue was generated in europe 
the ongoing financial crisis in the eurozone could impact our revenues and indirect credit exposure to certain of those governments through their public hospitals 
we are actively monitoring the situations in these countries
