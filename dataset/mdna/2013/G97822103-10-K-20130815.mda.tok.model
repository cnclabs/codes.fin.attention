listed below are certain generic prescription products  including authorized generic and orx products  that the company manufactures and or distributes generic name competitive brand name drug acetylcysteine injection acetadote adapalene cream differin ammonium lactate cream and lotion lac hydrin bacitracin ophthalmic ointment n a betamethasone foam luxiq benzoyl peroxide gel benzac cetirizine tablets and syrup zyrtec ciclopirox shampoo loprox clindamycin phosphate and benzoyl peroxide gel duac clindamycin phosphate foam and solution evoclin  cleocint clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride cleocin clobetasol foam  lotion and shampoo olux  olux e  clobex econazole nitrate cream spectazole erythromycin and benzoyl peroxide gel benzamycin erythromycin ophthalmic ointment n a erythromycin pads erycette  t stat fluticasone ointment and cream cutivate griseofulvin oral suspension grifulvin v halobetasol ointment and cream ultravate ibuprofen oral suspension motrin imiquimod cream aldara ketoconazole shampoo and foam nizoral  extina levocetirizine tablets and solution xyzal liothyronine sodium tablets cytomel mesalamine rectal suspension enema rowasa mometasone cream  ointment and lotion elocon mupirocin ointment bactroban nystatin topical powder mycostatin omeprazole tablets prilosec permethrin cream elimite polyethylene glycol miralax salicylic acid shampoo salex selenium sulfide shampoo selsun sodium sulfacetamide wash ovace terconazole suppositories terazol testosterone cypionate injection depo tretinoin cream and gel retin a triamcinolone acetonide nasal spray nasacort aq trospium tablets sanctura xr the company s us based customers are major wholesalers  including cardinal health  mckesson and amerisourcebergen  as well as national and regional retail drug  supermarket and mass merchandise chains  including walgreens  walmart  cvs  rite aid  kroger and safeway 
generic prescription drugs are sold to the consumer through the pharmacy counter of predominantly the same retail outlets as otc pharmaceuticals and nutritional products 
new product introductions and drug application approvals the company recently launched several new generic or authorized generic prescription products in rx  including betamethasone foam  acetylcysteine injection  clobetasol emollient foam and trospium tablets  which contain the same active ingredients present in the same dosage forms as luxiq  acetadote  olux e and sanctura xr  respectively 
net sales related to new products were approximately million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal an rx pharmaceuticals product is considered new if it was added to the company s product lines or sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities within months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured 
in fiscal  the company  on its own or in collaboration with partners  received final approval from the fda for four prescription drug applications for the following products betamethasone foam clobetasol emollient foam trospium tablets testosterone gel as of june   the company  on its own or in collaboration with partners  had generic rx drug applications pending approval with the fda 
collaboration agreements the company actively collaborates with other pharmaceutical companies to develop  manufacture and market certain products or groups of products 
these types of agreements are not uncommon in the pharmaceutical industry 
the company may choose to enter into these types of agreements to  among other things  leverage its or others scientific research and development expertise or utilize its extensive marketing and distribution resources

competition the market for generic prescription drugs is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers  brand name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of a branded product known as an authorized generic  manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs 
among the company s competitors are actavis  apotex  glenmark generics inc  impax  prasco  sandoz  taro pharmaceuticals  teva pharmaceutical industries ltd  triax pharmaceuticals  and zydus pharmaceuticals  as well as brand name pharmaceutical companies where the company offers a generic equivalent 
the company believes that one of its primary competitive advantages is its ability to introduce difficult to develop and or manufacture topical and other specialty generic equivalents to brand name drug products 
generally  these products are exposed to less competition due to the relatively longer development  clinical trial and approval processes 
in addition  the company believes it has a favorable competitive position due primarily to its efficient distribution systems  topical production economies of scale  customer service and overall reputation 
price competition from additional generic versions of the same product  as well as potential price competition from the original branded or authorized generic products  may result in a significant and or rapid decline in sales and profit margins 
in addition  competitors may also develop their products more rapidly or complete the regulatory approval process sooner and market their products earlier than the company 
new drugs and future developments in improved and or advanced drug delivery technologies or other therapeutic techniques may provide therapeutic or cost advantages to competing products 
many brand name competitors try to prevent  discourage or delay the use of generic equivalents through various measures  including introduction of new branded products  legislative initiatives  changing dosage forms or dosing regimens just prior to introduction of a generic equivalent  regulatory processes  filing new patents or patent extensions  lawsuits  citizens petitions and negative publicity 
in addition  brand name companies sometimes launch  either through an affiliate or licensing arrangements with another company  an authorized generic at or near the time the first generic product is launched  depriving the generic product market exclusivity intended by the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act hatch waxman 
for more information see information applicable to all reported segments government regulation us food and drug administration 
many of the company s customers  which include chain drug stores  wholesalers  distributors  hospital systems and group purchasing organizations  continue to merge or consolidate 
in addition  a number of its customers have instituted source programs limiting the number of suppliers of generic pharmaceutical products carried by that customer 
as a result of these developments  heightened competition exists among generic drug producers for business from this smaller and more selective customer base 
active pharmaceutical ingredients the company develops  manufactures and markets api used worldwide by the generic drug industry and branded pharmaceutical companies 
certain of these ingredients are used in its own pharmaceutical products 
the manufacturing of these api occurs primarily in israel 
this segment is undergoing a strategic platform transformation  moving certain production from israel to the acquired api manufacturing facility in india to allow for lower cost production and to create space for other  more complex production in israel 
significant developments the company has had a long standing commercial agreement the api agreement with a customer to supply an api for use in a generic finished dosage pharmaceutical product that was launched in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to unexpected developments in that market formation  the company customer was able to launch its product with day exclusivity status  which ended during the company second quarter of fiscal as a result  the company api operating results were positively impacted by approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million in fiscal to further improve the long term cost position of its api business  on august   the company acquired an stake in vedants drug fine chemicals private limited vedants  an api manufacturing facility in india  for million in cash 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company signed a definitive agreement to purchase the remaining stake in vedants for approximately million  subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the indian rupee and the us dollar 
the purchase is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal the facility  located approximately miles outside of mumbai  is currently under construction and will manufacture the company s current and future high volume api products  as well as expand the company s vertical integration of rx and future candidate rx to otc switch products 
manufacturing of api at this facility is expected to begin during fiscal  with shipments expected to commence in fiscal api business the api business identifies apis that will be critical to its pharmaceutical customers future product launches and then works closely with these customers on the development processes 
api development is focused on the synthesis of less common molecules for the us  european and other international markets 
the company is also focusing development activities on the synthesis of molecules for use in its own otc and rx pipeline products 
this vertical integration may enable the company to be more competitive on pricing of its other product lines and to broaden its growth and profit opportunities 
the company believes it has a competitive advantage in its ability to produce difficult to develop products through its understanding of regulatory issues  patents  and chemistry 
because of the difficulty in developing these products and the related regulatory challenges  the lead time to market a product can be long 
the company s ability to continue to develop and market new products that have lower levels of competition is key to driving profitability in the api business 
the api business sells to customers who face similar regulatory oversight as the company s rx pharmaceuticals business 
as a result  the api business is dependent on these customers ability to obtain proper product approvals and maintain regulatory compliance with the fda  the ftc  and the us drug enforcement administration dea  as well as several foreign  state and local agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
because the company s api customers depend on high quality supply and regulatory support  the company focuses on rigorous quality assurance  quality control and regulatory compliance as part of its strategic positioning 
the company s quality system is designed to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda  the european medicines agency and the australian therapeutic goods administration 
the company is regularly inspected by various regulatory authorities and customers 
the company places a high priority on responding to client needs and requirements from project initiation through final production 
it offers support throughout the development stage  preparation of drug master files dmf and assistance throughout the approval process 
the api segment is supported by sales offices in the us and israel and sales agents in various other countries 
the company currently manufactures and markets to generic and branded pharmaceutical companies worldwide the following api products ammonium lactate levocetirizine dihydrochloride anastrozole midazolam base cetirizine dihydrochloride midazolam maleate cilostazol modafinil cisatracurium mometasone furoate donepezil hydrochloride mometasone furoate monohydrate exemestane moxonidine fenofibrate omeprazole magnesium flumazenil palonosetron hydrochloride fluticasone propionate pentoxifylline granisetron hydrochloride rocuronium bromide granisetron base rotigotine halobetasol temozolomide imiquimod terbinafine hydrochloride imatinib mesylate tramadol hydrochloride letrozole new product introductions there were no new api product launches during fiscal for fiscal and  net sales related to new products were approximately million and million  respectively 
fiscal new product sales primarily relate to sales to the european market of temozolomide  which the company launched during the third quarter of fiscal an api product is considered new if it was added to the company s product lines or sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities within months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured 
competition the api segment operates in a highly competitive  price sensitive market in which the company s customers continue to consolidate and or vertically integrate  thereby creating a smaller customer base 
since other manufacturers of api typically do not offer all of the same product lines or serve all of the same markets as the company s api segment  the segment competes on a product by product basis with a number of different competitors 
the company s api business is subject to increased price competition from other manufacturers of api located mostly in india  china and europe 
this competition may result in the loss of api clients and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
however  the company believes that its regulatory position  market reputation  client relationships and ability to manufacture difficult to develop api provide it with a competitive position 
other the company has an other category comprised of israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products  which does not meet the quantitative threshold required to be a separately reportable segment 
the israel pharmaceutical business includes the marketing and manufacturing of branded and generic prescription drugs under long term exclusive licenses and the importation and distribution of pharmaceutical and other medical products into israel based on exclusive agreements with the manufacturers 
the israel diagnostics business is a leading player in the medical and clinical laboratory market in israel  supplying instrumentation  reagents and consumables to customers under multi year agreements 
competition the company s other category operates in competitive markets 
these markets are based primarily in israel  but the company is also subject to competition in those markets from large multi national companies looking to expand their position in the local israeli market 
in most instances  these companies are significantly larger than the company on a global basis with greater financial resources and product lines 
the company also has several significant product supply agreements with outside vendors 
as a result  the company s competitive position is largely dependent on its ability to maintain these agreements 
the company believes that its competitive advantages consist of its deep knowledge of the local markets  relevant infrastructure  customer relationships and strong local brand recognition 
information applicable to all reportable segments research and development research and development are key components of the company s business strategy and  while managed centrally on a global basis  are performed in various locations in the us and abroad 
development for both the consumer healthcare and nutritionals markets focuses on products comparable or better in formulation  quality and effectiveness to existing national brand otc products  nutritional supplement products  infant formulas and rx to otc switch products 
the company animal health products focus on both generic and branded product development 
development of generic prescription drugs  primarily for the us market  focuses on complex formulations  many of which require costly clinical endpoint trials 
development of generic products for the uk market focuses on oral liquid formulations for the branded rx products for which liquid formulations are not available 
development of api for the global market also focuses on complex products with high barriers to entry 
while the company conducts a significant amount of its own research and development  it also enters into strategic alliance agreements to obtain the rights to manufacture and or distribute new products 
research and development spending was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in addition  during fiscal  the company incurred an impairment charge of million related to the write off of certain in process research and development intangible assets that were acquired as part of the acquisition of paddock laboratories  inc paddock due to changes in the projected development and regulatory timelines for various projects 
fiscal included research and development expenses resulting from the sergeant  rosemont and velcera acquisitions 
fiscal included incremental research and development expenses attributable to the paddock acquisition 
the company anticipates that research and development expenditures will increase above fiscal levels in dollar terms but remain relatively flat as a percentage of net sales in the foreseeable future as the company continues to cultivate its presence in the generic pharmaceutical market and to develop its internal research and development capabilities 
trademarks and patents the company owns certain trademarks and patents  however  its business as a whole is not materially dependent upon its ownership of any one trademark or patent or group of trademarks or patents 
significant customers the company believes its primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current marketplace of the retail drug industry 
walmart accounted for of consolidated net sales for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal should walmart s current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business would have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated operating results and financial position 
the company does not anticipate such a change in the foreseeable future 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
currently the company has generally good relationships with all of its customers 
manufacturing and distribution the company s primary manufacturing facilities are located in the us and israel see item a 
risk factors conditions in israel for further information 
the company also has secondary manufacturing facilities located in the uk  mexico and australia  along with joint ventures located in china and india 
the company supplements its production capabilities with the purchase of some product from outside sources 
during fiscal  the approximate average capacity utilization was and for the company s facilities in the us and israel  respectively 
the capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times due to various reasons  such as customer demand  the seasonality of the cough cold flu  allergy or flea and tick seasons and new product launches 
the company may utilize available capacity by contract manufacturing for other companies 
the company has logistics facilities located in the us  israel  the uk  mexico and australia 
both contract freight and common carriers are used to deliver products 
seasonality revenues in the company s consumer healthcare segment are generally subject to the seasonal demands for cough cold flu products in its second and third fiscal quarters and allergy products in its first and fourth fiscal quarters 
historically  the company s sales of these products have varied from year to year based in large part on the severity and length of the cough cold flu season 
while the company believes that the severity and length of these seasons will continue to impact its sales of cough cold flu oral electrolytes and allergy products  there can be no assurance that the company s future sales of these products will necessarily follow historical patterns 
in addition  with the sergeant and velcera acquisitions discussed in the consumer healthcare segment  the company animal health products are subject to the seasonal demand for flea and tick products  which typically peaks during the warmer weather months 
revenues for the nutritionals  rx pharmaceuticals and api segments  as well as the other category  are generally not impacted significantly by seasonal conditions 
materials sourcing affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company s business units due to the nature of the products it manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and components are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
while the company has the ability to manufacture and supply certain api materials for the consumer healthcare segment  certain components and finished goods are purchased rather than manufactured because of temporary production limitations  fda restrictions or economic and other factors 
historically  the company has been able to react to situations that require alternate sourcing 
should alternate sourcing be required  fda requirements placed on products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results 
the company has good  cooperative working relationships with substantially all of its suppliers and has historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to its volume of purchases 
environmental the company is subject to various environmental laws and regulations 
the company believes that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations will not be material to the business of the company 
the company does not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding 
in march and june of  lawsuits were filed by three separate groups against both the state of israel and the council of ramat hovav in connection with waste disposal and pollution from several companies  including the company  that have operations in the ramat hovav region of israel 
these lawsuits were subsequently consolidated into a single proceeding in the district court of beer sheva 
the council of ramat hovav  in june  and the state of israel  in november  asserted third party claims against several companies  including the company 
the pleadings allege a variety of personal injuries arising out of the alleged environmental pollution 
neither the plaintiffs nor the third party claimants were required to specify a maximum amount of damages  but the pleadings allege damages in excess of million  subject to foreign currency fluctuations between the israeli shekel and the us dollar 
on january   the district court of beer sheva ruled in favor of the company 
on february   the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the supreme court 
while the company intends to vigorously defend against these claims  the company cannot reasonably predict at this time the outcome or the liability  if any  associated with these claims 
corporate social responsibility the company is committed to doing business in an ethical manner 
the company has a long history of environmentally sound and efficient operations  safe and healthy working conditions  and active participation in the communities where the company is located 
the company corporate social responsibility commitment statement highlights seven areas at the heart of its efforts helping consumers access safe  effective and affordable healthcare products complying with regulatory and legal requirements demonstrating environmental stewardship continuously improving packaging sustainability protecting human rights of its global employees and challenging its partners to do the same providing a safe and healthy work environment for its employees establishing effective community partnerships through these efforts  the company strives to minimize its impact on the environment  drive responsible business practices and ensure the welfare of its employees now and into the future 
government regulation the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  testing  storing  distributing  advertising and sale of the company s products are subject to regulation by one or more us agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the dea  the usda  the epa and the consumer product safety commission cpsc  as well as several foreign  state and local regulatory agencies in localities in which the company s products are sold 
in addition  the company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with standards set by organizations  such as the united states pharmacopeial convention  inc usp  nsf international nsf  and the international organization for standardization iso 
the company believes that its policies  operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations 
us food and drug administration the fda has jurisdiction over the company s anda  nda and otc monograph drug products  infant formulas  dietary supplements  food products and medical devices 
the fda s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing  testing  labeling  packaging  storage and distribution of these products 
otc and us generic prescription pharmaceuticals many of the company s otc pharmaceutical products are regulated under the otc monograph system and subject to certain fda regulations 
otc monographs have been established through the fda s otc review utilizing the notice and comment rulemaking procedures 
under the otc monograph system  selected otc drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
the fda otc monographs include well known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications  required warnings and precautions  allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels 
drug products marketed under the otc monograph system must conform to specific quality  formula and labeling requirements  however  these products can be developed and marketed without prior fda approval unlike products requiring a submission and approval of an anda or nda 
in general  it is less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the otc monograph system 
from time to time  adequate information may become available to the fda regarding certain anda or nda drug products that will allow the reclassification of those products as no longer requiring the approval of an anda or nda prior to marketing 
for this reason  there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to a particular product should it be reclassified to the otc monograph system 
the fda and usp have embarked on an initiative to modernize the monograph requirements of otc drugs 
the company is monitoring the situation and will make appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance 
in addition  regulations may change from time to time  requiring formulation  packaging or labeling changes for certain products 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
the company also markets generic prescription drugs and other products that have switched from prescription to otc status through an application process initiated by the innovator company that holds the original clinical trial data 
these products require approval by the fda of an anda or nda prior to commercial marketing 
based on current fda regulations  andas and ndas provide information on chemistry  manufacturing controls  clinical safety  efficacy and or bioequivalence  packaging and labeling 
the development process for a generic drug generally requires less time and expense than the development process for a new drug 
the fda requires the anda or nda sponsor to submit data demonstrating the product is bioequivalent to the reference listed drug 
bioequivalence studies for systematically absorbed products are typically performed using a small number of subjects in a controlled clinical environment 
products that are locally acting require end point clinical studies  with a significant number of subjects  performed in patient populations  and are generally larger in study size and longer in duration 
the current anda median approval time is approximately months from the date an anda is submitted 
nda approval times are significantly shorter and typically are achieved in months or less 
changes to a product marketed under an anda or nda are governed by specific fda regulations and guidelines that define when proposed changes can be implemented and whether prior fda notice and or approval is required 
under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of the hatch waxman amendments to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  a company submitting an nda can obtain a three year period of marketing exclusivity for an rx product or an rx to otc switch product if the company performs a clinical study that is essential to fda approval 
longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities and orphan drugs 
while the exclusivity period is in force  the fda cannot approve any andas for a similar or equivalent generic product 
where three years of exclusivity is granted to the innovator company  the company will be unable to market the product during this period unless the company establishes a relationship with the company having exclusive marketing rights 
there can be no assurance that  in the event the company applies for fda approvals  the company will obtain the approvals to market rx  rx to otc switch products or otc anda products or  alternatively  that the company will be able to obtain these products from other manufacturers 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act ffdca  a manufacturer may obtain an additional six months which  under certain circumstances  may be extended to one year of exclusivity if the innovator conducts pediatric studies requested by the fda on the product 
this exclusivity will  in certain instances  delay fda approval and the sales by the company of certain anda and other products 
if the company is first to file its anda and meets certain requirements relating to the patents owned or licensed by the brand company  the company may be entitled to a day generic exclusivity period for that product 
when a company submits an anda  the company is required to include a patent certification to certain patents that are identified with the innovator product 
if the anda applicant challenges the validity of the innovator s patent or certifies that its product does not infringe the patent  thereby seeking to market its product prior to the patent expiry  the product innovator may sue for infringement 
the legal action would not ordinarily result in material damages but could prevent the company from introducing the product if it is not successful in the legal action 
the company would  however  incur the cost of defending the legal action and that action could have the effect of triggering a statutorily mandated delay in fda approval of the anda for a period of up to months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge 
in addition  if generic exclusivity is granted to the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to market the product at the beginning of the exclusivity period or that the exclusivity will not be shared with other generic companies  including authorized generics 
it is possible that more than one applicant files the first anda on the same day and exclusivity is shared 
this may happen by chance  but more likely when there is a certain type of innovator exclusivity that prevents the filing of all andas until a specific date 
as a result of events that are outside of the company s control  the company may forfeit its exclusivity 
finally  if the company is not first to file its anda  the fda may grant day exclusivity to another company  thereby effectively delaying the launch of the company s product 
the company s prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda s policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda s september compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks and that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action 
see further information related to regulation by the fda in item a 
risk factors 
all facilities where rx and otc drugs are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored or distributed must comply with fda cgmps and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located 
all of the company s drug products are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations 
the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company s facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations 
the failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to store brand customers or to regulatory action against the company related to the products made in that facility  including suspension of or delay in anda approvals  seizure  injunction or recall 
serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the company that  among other things  could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the company s products  product seizures  loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties  and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or operating results 
in addition  several bills have been introduced in congress that could  if enacted  affect the manufacture and marketing of rx and otc drugs 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company s activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company s business 
the company submits a drug master file dmf for active pharmaceutical ingredients to be commercialized in the us the dmf filings provide an efficient mechanism for fda review while protecting the company s proprietary information related to the manufacturing process 
the manufacturing facilities are inspected by the fda to assess cgmp compliance 
the manufacturing facilities and production procedures utilized must be cgmp compliant before api may be exported to the us for european markets  the company submits a european dmf and  where applicable  obtains a certificate of suitability from the european directorate for the quality of medicines 
the manufacturing facilities and production procedures for api marketed in europe must meet eu gmp and european pharmacopeia standards 
infant formula the fda s center for food safety and applied nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula 
the office of nutritional products  labeling and dietary supplements onplds has program responsibility for infant formula  while the office of food additive safety ofas has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging 
the onplds evaluates whether the infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the ffdca and consults with the ofas regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula 
all manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients  which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives 
the specific requirements for infant formula are governed by the infant formula act 
the purpose of the infant formula act is to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas  including minimum  and in some cases  maximum levels of specified nutrients 
once an infant formula product is formulated  the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation before marketing the infant formula 
the fda has established requirements for certain labeling  nutrient content  and manufacturer quality control procedures to assure the nutrient content of infant formulas  as well as for company records and reports 
a manufacturer must notify the fda days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer 
the fda currently is finalizing revised good manufacturing practices  quality control procedures  quality factors  notification requirements  and reports and records  for the production of infant formulas 
the company is actively monitoring fda proposed changes and will make appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance 
in addition  as part of its responsibility to implement the provisions of the ffdca  the fda continuously monitors infant formula products 
the ffdca requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf life  to keep records on production  testing and distribution of each batch of infant formula and to use current good manufacturing practices and quality control procedures 
in addition  the ffdca requires infant formula manufacturers to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events  some of which are reviewed to reveal the possible existence of a health hazard 
the fda conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula 
the fda also inspects new facilities during early production runs 
as part of the inspection  the fda collects and analyzes samples of infant formula 
dietary supplements the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea amended the ffdca to  among other things define dietary supplements and dietary ingredients  require ingredient and nutrition labeling for dietary supplements  permit structure function statements for dietary supplements  permit the display of certain published literature where supplements are sold  authorize the fda to establish gmps specifically for dietary supplements  and require the submission of new dietary ingredient notification to the fda 
the dshea provides specific nutrition labeling requirements for dietary supplements that are slightly different than those for conventional foods 
all supplements must bear a supplement facts box  which lists all of the supplement s dietary ingredients using nomenclature as specified by fda regulation 
dshea also permits dietary supplements to bear statements claiming a benefit related to a classical nutrient deficiency disease  provided the prevalence of the disease in the us is disclosed  describing the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function in humans  characterizing the documented mechanism by which a nutrient or dietary ingredient acts to maintain such structure or function  and describing general well being from consumption of a nutrient or dietary ingredient 
the company is subject to regulations published by the fda clarifying the types of structure function statements permissible in dietary supplement labeling 
such statements cannot expressly or implicitly state that a dietary supplement has any effect on a disease 
as with foods in general  dietary supplement labeling may include a health claim  which characterizes the role of a nutrient to a disease or health related condition 
there are two types of health claims health claims authorized by fda regulations based on significant scientific agreement among qualified scientific experts  and qualified health claims  which may be made with a lower level of substantiation  provided that the fda does not object to the claims 
in each case  the health claim must be reviewed and approved by the fda before it may be used 
on june   the fda issued final gmp regulations specific to dietary supplements  which became effective as they relate to the company on june  the company continues to invest in its dietary supplement operations to ensure compliance with the regulations 
the fda began inspecting the industry after the june  compliance date 
the company continuously monitors fda activities  including publicly available inspection reports of other companies inspections  to ensure that its operations and quality systems are maintained in a state of compliance based on the current interpretation of the regulations 
the company has not yet been inspected and cannot determine with certainty what effects the fda future interpretations of the regulations will have on its business 
the gmp regulations and fda future interpretations of these regulations could  among other things  require expanded documentation of the manufacturing processes for certain products or additional analytical testing for certain ingredients 
in addition  several bills have been introduced in congress that could  if enacted  affect the manufacture and marketing of dietary supplements 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation regulating the company activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on the company business the dshea requires that the fda be notified at least days in advance of the introduction of a dietary supplement that contains a dietary ingredient that was introduced to market after october  or was present in the food supply in a form where the food had not been chemically altered 
the notification must provide information establishing that the dietary supplement containing the dietary ingredient will reasonably be expected to be safe 
food safety modernization act portions of the nutritionals segment business are subject to the food safety modernization act fsma  which became law in the stated purpose of the fsma is to ensure us foods are safe by shifting the focus from containment of contamination to prevention 
the law mandates comprehensive  prevention based controls within the food industry 
it also gives the fda mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers 
the fsma impacts food and food ingredient imports through a supplier verification program 
under the fsma  the fda is also taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of an outbreak 
the fda has yet to issue a complete set of regulations under the fsma 
additional clarity is expected once the regulations are finalized

us environmental protection agency pet care products the us environmental protection agency epa is responsible for the regulation of companion animal flea and tick products that are applied and act topically 
the active ingredients in flea and tick products are pesticides that are regulated under the federal insecticide  fungicide  and rodenticide act 
pesticides cannot be distributed or sold in the us unless they are registered with the epa 
the epa may grant a pesticide registration to an applicant after making a determination that the use of the pesticide product will meet the statutory requirement that it will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on the environment  ie the product will not present an unreasonable risk 
an applicant must demonstrate that a pesticide product meets the safety and efficacy standards required by epa by submitting an extensive battery of toxicology and efficacy studies  or by providing reference to pre existing data for the evaluation of possible risks to both humans and the animals that may be exposed to the pesticide product 
the epa will not approve a product if there is any reason to doubt that the product can be used safely and efficaciously 
when epa issues a registration for a pesticide product  the epa approves the precise formula for the product and the language in the product labeling 
it is a violation of federal law for a company to distribute or sell a pesticide product that deviates from the formulation composition and label language approved by the epa 
the epa and state regulators conduct cooperative compliance programs to monitor pesticide products and if necessary  take appropriate enforcement actions 
in addition to the registration process  the epa conducts a registration review program that periodically re evaluates pesticides that the epa has approved 
new studies may be required  additional safety and use restrictions may be mandated  and  if the epa decides that a product no longer meets the required safety and efficacy standards  the epa can cancel the product registration 
companies that hold pesticide product registrations must report any adverse events that may result from the use of the products 
the epa reviews these reports and may take action to modify or withdraw a registration if the epa decides that such action is necessary to ensure that the pesticide products meet the stringent safety and efficacy standards mandated by law 
us drug enforcement administration the dea regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances  such as morphine  hydromorphone  opium  and list i chemicals  such as pseudoephedrine  pursuant to the federal controlled substances act csa 
the csa and dea regulations impose specific requirements on manufacturers and other entities that handle these substances including registration  recordkeeping  reporting  storage  security and distribution 
recordkeeping requirements include accounting for the amount of product received  manufactured  stored and distributed  as well as yield losses 
companies handling either controlled substances or list i chemicals are also required to maintain adequate security and to report suspicious orders  thefts and significant losses 
the dea periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the csa and its regulations 
failure to comply with current and future regulations of the dea could lead to a variety of sanctions  including revocation or denial of renewal of dea registrations  injunctions  or civil or criminal penalties 
the company is subject to the requirements of the csa and dea regulations in the handling of any controlled substances in schedules ii v or any of the list i chemicals 
specifically  the company is subject to regulation in the commercial manufacture and distribution of products containing the list i drug pseudoephedrine and products containing the schedule ii drugs morphine  hydromorphone and opium 
as a result of a series of amendments to the csa  the dea has imposed increased restrictions on the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products 
for example  the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of was enacted to authorize the dea to monitor transactions involving chemicals that may be used illegally in the production of methamphetamine 
the comprehensive methamphetamine control act of establishes certain registration and recordkeeping requirements for manufacturers of otc cold  allergy  asthma and diet medicines that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or phenylpropanolamine ppa 
while certain of the company s otc drug products contain pseudoephedrine  which is a common ingredient in nasal decongestant products  the company s us products contain neither ephedrine nor ppa 
in addition  the reauthorization act of  signed into law on march   prevented the existing provisions of the patriot act from expiring and also included the combat methamphetamine epidemic act 
this law further amended the csa and provided additional requirements with respect to the manufacture  distribution and sale of pseudoephedrine products 
among the various provisions  this national legislation places certain restrictions on the purchase and sale of all products that contain ephedrine  pseudoephedrine or ppa list i chemical products 
the csa also imposed import and procurement quotas for list i chemicals  including pseudoephedrine 
the csa  as amended  also imposed daily restrictions on the amount of list i chemical products a retailer may sell to a consumer grams per day and limitations on the amount of list i chemical products a consumer may purchase grams over a day period 
further  effective september   the csa requires that a retail sellers maintain a logbook that tracks the sales of list i chemical products to individuals  and b purchasers provide valid identification in order to purchase list i chemical products 
many states have also enacted legislation regulating the manufacture and distribution of pseudoephedrine products 
the company is subject to these state requirements as well 
medicaid drug rebate program and other drug pricing programs federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer  as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for the manufacturer s drugs under medicaid and medicare part b  must enter into a rebate agreement to pay rebates to state medicaid programs for the manufacturer s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state medicaid program 
the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms is responsible for administering the medicaid rebate agreements between the federal government and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
rebates are due on the utilization of medicaid managed care organizations  as well as under fee for service arrangements 
drug manufacturers medicaid rebate agreements  which are between each manufacturer and the secretary of health and human services  provide that the drug manufacturer will remit rebates to each state medicaid agency on a quarterly basis 
those rebates are based on pricing data reported by manufacturers to cms  including average manufacturer price amp  which is reported on a monthly and quarterly basis  and  in the case of innovator products  best price  which is reported on a quarterly basis 
health reform legislation changed the definition of amp effective the fourth quarter of calendar pursuant to the same legislation  effective for rebate periods beginning with the first quarter of calendar  the rebate formulas used to determine the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows for noninnovator products  in general generic drugs marketed under andas  the rebate amount is of the amp for the quarter  for innovator products  in general brand name products marketed under ndas  the rebate amount is the greater of of the amp for the quarter or the difference between such amp and the best price for that same quarter 
this rate is for innovator drugs approved exclusively for pediatric indications  as well as for certain clotting factors 
manufacturers also pay an additional rebate on innovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation 
the company has a medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the federal government 
federal and or state governments have and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public  including the enactment in december of medicare legislation that expanded the scope of medicare coverage to include outpatient drugs part d  starting in january  as well as health reform legislation enacted in management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the company s profitability 
various states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on medicaid utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer s federal medicaid agreement 
states also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non medicaid populations  known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs 
these rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated 
although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs  for the company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to quarterly medicaid drug rebate obligations 
as described herein  cms rules require pharmaceutical companies to calculate and report the amp to cms on a monthly as well as a quarterly basis 
in addition to using this information to calculate rebates  cms is preparing to use amp to calculate a type of federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multiple source drugs to pharmacies under the medicaid program  known as the federal upper limit ful 
prior to using amp  cms typically used pricing data from third party compendia  such as the average wholesaler price awp or wholesaler acquisition cost wac  in the calculation of fuls 
health reform legislation enacted in amended the statutory definition of amp and also amended the definition of multiple source drug in a manner that materially affects the calculation of fuls 
cms has begun posting draft amp based ful reimbursement files on the cms website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation 
currently  the ful reimbursement files are for review and comment only  however  cms has announced that it plans to publish final fuls after a period of releasing them in draft format 
cms issued a proposed rule in february that provided guidance on the revised amp definition and calculation of fuls but has not issued a final rule 
separately  under existing statutory authority granted by the deficit reduction act of  cms has begun collecting retail survey price information from retail community pharmacies to generate publicly available pricing files 
cms expects that the pricing files will provide state medicaid agencies with an array of covered outpatient drug prices concerning retail pharmacy acquisition costs and consumer purchase prices and that state agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the surveys 
cms has begun posting drafts of this retail survey price information in the form of draft national average drug acquisition cost nadac files  which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs  and national average retail price narp files  which reflect retail community pharmacy prices to consumers 
currently  the retail survey price information files are for review and comment only 
the company does not know how the new methodologies for calculating amp and fuls or the retail survey price information will affect the company pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in medicaid reimbursements to the company 
the company cannot predict how the sharing of weighted average monthly amp data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace 
manufacturers also must participate in the b drug pricing program for federal funds to be available to pay for their drugs under medicaid and medicare part b 
participating manufacturers must agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the b ceiling price for the manufacturer s covered outpatient drugs 
sales made by the company pursuant to the b program are not material to the company as a whole 
additional federal and state regulation the federal health care program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  ordering  or arranging for the purchase or order of any health care item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid  or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers  purchasers and formulary managers on the other 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common manufacturer business arrangements and activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases  or recommendations of the company s products may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to get a false claim paid 
since  several pharmaceutical and other health care companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under these laws for a variety of activities that have been alleged to have caused the submission of false claims to federal health care programs  including providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product and marketing of products for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
the company s activities relating to the sale and marketing of its products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  that apply regardless of the payor 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer s products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
consumer product safety commission under the poison prevention packaging act pppa  the cpsc has authority to require that certain dietary supplements and certain pharmaceuticals have child resistant packaging to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings 
the cpsc has published regulations requiring iron containing dietary supplements and various pharmaceuticals to have child resistant packaging  and has established rules for testing the effectiveness of child resistant packaging and for ensuring senior adult effectiveness 
the consumer product safety improvement act of cpsia amended the consumer product safety act cpsa to require that the manufacturer of any product that is subject to any cpsc rule  ban  standard or regulation certify that based on a reasonable testing program the product complies with cpsc requirements 
this certification applies to pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements that require child resistant packaging under the pppa 
the cpsc lifted the stay of enforcement of the certification requirement and the regulation has been in effect since february  federal trade commission the ftc exercises primary jurisdiction over the advertising and other promotional practices of marketers of dietary supplements and otc pharmaceuticals and often works with the fda regarding these practices 
the ftc considers whether a product s claims are substantiated  truthful and not misleading 
the ftc is also responsible for reviewing mergers between and acquisitions of pharmaceutical companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigating certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry 
the ftc could challenge these business practices in administrative or judicial proceedings 
for example  in accordance with the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  agreements between nda and anda holders relating to settlements of patent litigation involving paragraph iv certifications under the hatch waxman act  as well as agreements between generic applicants that have submitted andas containing paragraph iv certifications where the agreement concerns either company s day exclusivity  must be submitted to the ftc and the united states department of justice for review 
state regulation most states regulate and require approval of a license to manufacture and distribute foods  drugs and pet care products under laws that generally parallel federal statutes 
license requirements and fees vary by state 
the company is also subject to other state consumer health and safety regulations that could have a potential impact on the company s business if the company is ever found to be non compliant

the registration file relating to any particular product must contain medical data related to product efficacy and safety  including results of clinical testing and references to medical publications  as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control 
health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or manufactured and marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions 
data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries  including in the european union  where these provisions were recently extended  although the application is not uniform 
similar provisions may be adopted by additional countries  including israel  where legislation has been proposed 
in general  these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand name product in that country 
as these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity  they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired

risk factors 
risks related to the transactions a significant delay in consummating or a failure to consummate the transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company stock price and operating results 
on july   the company entered into the transaction agreement  under the terms of which holdco will acquire elan pursuant to the scheme and mergersub will merge with and into the company  with the company continuing as the surviving corporation of the merger 
because the transactions are subject to certain closing conditions  it is possible that the transactions may not be completed or may not be completed as quickly as expected 
if the transactions are not completed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company stock price 
in addition  any significant delay in consummating the transactions could have a material adverse effect on the company operating results and adversely affect the company customer and supplier relationships and would likely lead to a significant diversion of management and employee attention and potential employee attrition 
the company and elan must obtain approvals and governmental and regulatory consents to complete the transactions  which  if delayed  not granted or granted with unacceptable conditions  may jeopardize or delay the transactions  result in additional expenditures of money and resources and or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions 
conditions to implementation of the transactions include  among others  the expiration or termination of all waiting periods under applicable antitrust laws  including the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended  and foreign antitrust laws 
the governmental agencies from which the parties will seek these approvals have broad discretion in administering the governing regulations 
as a condition to their approval of the transactions  governmental agencies may impose requirements  limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of the company business after consummation of the transactions 
these requirements  limitations  costs  divestitures or restrictions could jeopardize or delay the consummation of the transactions or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the business combination 
if the company and elan agree to any material requirements  limitations  costs  divestitures or restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to consummate the transactions  these requirements  limitations  costs  divestitures or restrictions could adversely affect the company ability to integrate its operations with elan operations or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transactions 
this could result in a failure to consummate the transactions or have a material adverse effect on the company business and results of operations 
expenses related to the proposed acquisition are significant and will adversely affect the company operating results 
the company has incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition  including legal and investment banking fees 
the company expects these costs to have an adverse effect on its operating results 
in addition  if the acquisition is not consummated under certain circumstances  the company may be required to pay to elan a termination fee of approximately million 
the effect of this termination fee may discourage competing bidders from presenting proposals to acquire or merge with the company that  from a financial perspective  might be superior to the terms of the transactions 
the company financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected if it were required to pay the termination fee to elan 
restrictions on the conduct of the company business prior to the completion of the proposed acquisition may have a negative impact on its operating results 
the company has agreed to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business in connection with the proposed acquisition that requires it to refrain from certain activities in its conduct of business before the transactions are consummated 
these restrictions may delay or prevent the company from undertaking business opportunities that may arise pending completion of the acquisition 
the fact that the transactions are pending could have an adverse effect on the company business  revenue and operating results 
while the transactions are pending  it creates uncertainty about the company future that may adversely affect its business  revenue and results of operations  including the diversion of management and employee attention  the fact that the company has incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses related to the transactions  the effect of the announcement or pendency of the transactions on the company business relationships  operating results and business generally  including with respect to its suppliers and its customers  and the risk that  if elan breaches the transaction agreement  damages may not fully compensate the company for such breach and associated litigation may arise and be costly and disruptive to the company operations 
if the transactions occur  the company shareholders will suffer dilution of their investment and  as a result  will not benefit fully from any subsequent appreciation in the company business 
after the merger  the company will cease to be a public company and will be a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of holdco 
the company former shareholders are only expected to hold approximately of the holdco shares immediately after the transactions 
as a result  the company former shareholders participation in any future earnings or growth of the company will be diluted 
the company may fail to realize benefits estimated as a result of the transactions 
the success of the transactions will depend  in part  on the company ability to realize the anticipated synergies  business opportunities and growth prospects from combining its business with that of elan as subsidiaries under the new holdco parent company 
the company may never realize these anticipated synergies  business opportunities and growth prospects 
integrating operations will be complex and will require significant efforts and expenditures 
employees might leave or be terminated because of the transactions 
the company management might have its attention diverted while trying to integrate operations and corporate and administrative infrastructures 
assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings may be inaccurate and general industry and business conditions might deteriorate 
if any of these factors limit the company ability to integrate its operations with those of elan successfully or on a timely basis  the expectations of future results of operations  including certain cost savings and synergies expected to result from the transactions  might not be met 
risks related to the bridge credit agreement the company may not be able to obtain reasonable financing terms in connection with the refinancings it expects to undertake for the elan transaction  and any such refinancings may have a negative effect on the company business and result in changes to its capital structure 
in connection with the elan transaction  the company expects to refinance all or a portion of its outstanding indebtedness and incur additional indebtedness 
the company may not be able to refinance its existing indebtedness or obtain additional financing on similar terms  as credit markets may be uncertain and potentially volatile 
the company may be required to incur indebtedness with terms less favorable than its existing indebtedness in order to complete the elan transactions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company ability to execute its business strategy and its results of operations 
the company has entered into certain bridge facilities in connection with the elan transaction 
to the extent these bridge facilities are drawn upon  the company would be required to quickly refinance such indebtedness  further enhancing the foregoing risks 
if the company is unable to refinance the bridge facilities  it may also be required to sell certain assets to repay those facilities  which may not occur on favorable terms and may negatively impact its business plans 
in addition  any refinancing activities the company undertakes or the incurrence of additional indebtedness may result in changes to the company credit ratings  which could also adversely affect its cost of financing 
similarly  a change in the company credit rating could limit its ability to refinance maturing liabilities and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs in the future 
lastly  the refinancing activities the company may undertake in connection with the elan transactions are expected to result in changes to its capital structure 
for example  the company may redeem outstanding notes and or issue new notes  including convertible notes 
these transactions may occur prior to the completion of the elan transactions and remain in place regardless of whether the elan transaction is completed which may have a material adverse impact on the company results of operations  cash flow and liquidity 
the elan transaction and the related financings are subject to certain regulatory filings and conditions 
any unforeseen changes or delays in the regulatory requirements may impact the timing or the company ability to complete the required actions within the terms of its agreements 
risks related to the company business the company operates in a highly regulated industry 
an inability to meet current or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial position and operating results 
several us and foreign agencies regulate the manufacturing  processing  formulation  packaging  labeling  testing  storing  distribution  advertising and sale of the company products 
various state and local agencies also regulate these activities 
in addition  the company manufactures and markets certain of its products in accordance with the guidelines established by voluntary standards organizations 
should the company or one of its third party service providers used in the development or commercialization of products fail to adequately conform to these regulations and guidelines  there may be a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
packaging  labeling or marketing changes mandated by the fda or state and local agencies can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations of the company 
in particular  california has enacted legislation that requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the saleable unit level through the distribution system 
california electronic pedigree requirement is scheduled to take effect in january compliance with california and future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase the company operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens 
required changes could also be related to safety or efficacy issues 
similarly  the failure by the company or one of its suppliers to comply with manufacturing  quality and testing guidelines and regulations could have a significant adverse impact on the company operating results 
there is also the risk that the fda could require the company to audit or repeat prior bioequivalence or clinical studies or the fda could change or withdraw the approval governing such products  which could have a material adverse impact on the results of the company operations 
the company believes that it generally has a good relationship with the fda  which it intends to maintain 
if these relationships should deteriorate  however  the company ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded 
all us facilities where rx  infant formula  dietary supplements and otc drugs are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored or distributed must comply with fda cgmps 
all of the company anda  nda and otc drug products are manufactured  tested  packaged  stored and distributed according to cgmp regulations 
the fda performs periodic audits to ensure that the company facilities remain in compliance with all applicable regulations 
if it finds violations of cgmp  the fda could make its concerns public and could impose sanctions including  among others  fines  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production and or distribution  suspension of the fda review of product applications  injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
if imposed  enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on the company operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
although the company has internal compliance programs in place that it believes are adequate  the fda may conclude that these programs do not meet regulatory standards 
if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could have a material adverse effect on the company business 
the fda policy regarding the award of a day market exclusivity period to generic manufacturers who successfully challenge patents relating to specific products continues to be the subject of extensive litigation in the us the fda current interpretation of hatch waxman is to award days of exclusivity to the first generic manufacturer who files a successful paragraph iv certification under hatch waxman challenging the patent s of the branded product  regardless of whether the manufacturer was sued for patent infringement 
although the fda interpretation may benefit some of the products in the company pipeline  it may adversely affect others 
the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of provides that the day market exclusivity period provided under hatch waxman is triggered by the commercial marketing of the product 
however  the medicare prescription drug act also contains forfeiture provisions which  if met  will deprive the first paragraph iv filer of exclusivity 
additionally  the manufacturer of the branded product may launch a generic version of its own drug  known as an authorized generic 
under certain circumstances  the company may not be able to fully exploit its day exclusivity period resulting from it being the first filer 
under the food and drug administration amendments act of  the fda has the power to restrict medications that raise serious safety concerns 
this law requires  and provides funding for  the fda to monitor drugs after they go on the market 
in addition  this law requires companies to make public the results of many of their studies 
under this law  the fda has the authority to require new studies  limit distribution or order label changes 
because of this law  the company ability to bring new and current products to market could be impeded  which could have a negative material impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
the company prescription drug products that are marketed without approved applications must meet certain manufacturing and labeling standards established by the fda 
the fda policy with respect to the continued marketing of unapproved products is stated in the fda september compliance policy guide  titled marketed new drugs without approved ndas or andas 
under this policy  the fda has stated that it will follow a risk based approach with regard to enforcement against such unapproved products 
the fda evaluates whether to initiate enforcement action on a case by case basis  but gives higher priority to enforcement action against products in certain categories  such as those marketed as unapproved drugs with potential safety risks or that lack evidence of effectiveness 
the fda recognizes that certain unapproved products  based on the introduction date of their active ingredients and the lack of safety concerns  among other things  have been marketed for many years and  at this time  might not be subject to immediate enforcement action 
the company believes that so long as it complies with applicable manufacturing and labeling standards  it will be in compliance with the fda current enforcement policy 
there can be no assurance that the fda will continue this policy or not take a contrary position with any individual product or group of products 
if the fda were to take a contrary position  the company may be required to seek fda approval for these products or withdraw such products from the market 
for fiscal  the company annual sales for such unapproved products were approximately million 
the nonprescription drug advisory committee met in december to discuss the efficacy of phenylephrine  an active ingredient used in various cough and cold products as a nasal decongestant 
the advisory committee vote recommended that available data is supportive of the efficacy of phenylephrine at milligrams 
in addition  the advisory committee recommended additional evidence to support the efficacy of a milligram dose of phenylephrine 
the recommendations by the advisory committee are not binding on the fda 
it is not known at this time what  if any  further action the fda or industry will take in response to recommendations of the advisory committee 
in fiscal  products containing phenylephrine generated revenues of approximately million 
certain actions by the fda  such as mandating label and formula changes  could have an adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
in october  the fda convened a joint meeting of the pediatric and nonprescription drugs advisory committees to discuss the safety and efficacy of otc cough and cold products for use in children 
the advisory committees recommended that these products no longer be used in children under the age of six 
on october   the fda issued a statement supporting the voluntary action of the consumer healthcare product association chpa  of which the company is a member  to modify product labels for consumers of otc cough and cold medicines to state do not use in children under four years of age 
the company completed the chpa recommended revisions to all otc cough and cold products in april the fda has not issued any further guidance about the labeling of otc cough and cold medicines in children two years of age and older 
sales of the company pediatric cough and cold products could be adversely affected should the fda adopt the more restrictive recommendations of the advisory committee 
the company activities with respect to its infant formula products also may be subject to barriers or sanctions imposed by countries or international organizations limiting international trade and dictating the specific content of infant formula products 
in addition  regulatory changes or decisions that restrict the manufacture  labeling and availability of the company infant formula products could affect the company results of operations 
for example  certain governmental agencies  non governmental organizations and consumer advocates have lobbied against the marketing and sale of some infant formula products 
these efforts could result in increased regulatory restrictions or enforcement 
the us government will likely continue to enhance its regulations on the industry aimed to ensure the safety and quality of dairy products  including  but not limited to  compulsory batch by batch inspection and testing for additional safety and quality issues 
such inspections and testing may increase the company operating costs related to its infant formula products 
the food and drug administration safety and innovation act fdasia  which amends both the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act and public health service act phs act  was signed into law on july  the new law establishes among other things  new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars  new fda authority concerning drug shortages  changes to enhance the fda inspection authority of the drug supply chain  a limited extension of the generic drug paragraph iv month stay provision and reduces the time required for the fda responses to generic blocking citizen petitions 
the company has implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self identification and user fee requirements of fdasia 
to the extent the fda believes that the company has not adequately fulfilled fdasia compliance requirements  it could lead to potential supply chain interruptions  delays in regulatory approval of new applications  and impede the company ability to realize sales and revenue  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on the company business 
on august  fda released a drug safety communication notifying the public of an association between acetaminophen and the risk of rare  but serious  skin reactions reddening of the skin  rash  blisters  detachment of the skin upper surface 
this resulted from a review of the fda adverse event database and reports in the medical literature 
other prescription and otc drugs used to treat fever and pain body aches eg  non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs  or nsaids  such as ibuprofen and naproxen also carry the risk of causing serious skin reactions  which is already described in the warnings section of their drug labels 
as a result of these findings  fda will require the addition of a warning addressing serious skin reactions to prescription drug products containing acetaminophen 
fda will also request that manufacturers of acetaminophen otc products marketed under a new drug application or under the otc monograph add a similar warning 
because of this new warning  the company sales of products containing acetaminophen could be impeded  which could have a negative material impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
the company manufactures products that are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions  however  certain products contain ingredients that can be used for improper purposes 
additional legislation or regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients  which could have an adverse impact on the company sales of such products and resulting income 
the company products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions 
however  certain products contain ingredients that can be  and in some cases are  used for improper purposes 
pseudoephedrine and dextromethorphan are two of these ingredients  but others may exist 
increasingly  various efforts are employed by federal and state governments in an effort to curb this misuse  including the consideration of additional legislation or regulation that may result in further restrictive requirements for the manufacture or sale of products containing these ingredients 
the company cannot predict if or when any additional legislation or regulation will be passed and any adverse impact it may have on the company results of operations 
pseudoephedrine the company produces a number of products that contain the active ingredient pseudoephedrine pse  which is indicated as a nasal decongestant 
pse has been under scrutiny as an ingredient illegally used to produce methamphetamine 
to address this concern  legislation has been enacted at the federal level restricting the sales of pse products ie  combat methamphetamine epidemic act and authorizing the dea to place quotas on the amounts of pse raw material that can be procured ie  the controlled substances act 
at the state level  a number of states have introduced or passed legislation placing additional restrictions on the sale of pse products 
in addition  the states of oregon and mississippi have moved pse products to rx status  many localities have passed similar legislation and a few other states have considered moving pse products to rx status 
sales of pse products could be adversely affected by action at the state or federal level to place additional restrictions on the sale of pse products 
dextromethorphan the company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient dextromethorphan  which is indicated for cough suppression 
dextromethorphan has come under scrutiny because of its potential to be abused 
legislation has been unsuccessfully introduced at the federal level over the past few sessions of congress that  if enacted  generally would have prohibited the bulk sale of dextromethorphan and would have imposed a federal age limit of years old in order to purchase finished products containing dextromethorphan 
similarly  california has passed legislation prohibiting the sale of dextromethorphan containing products to individuals under the age of without a prescription 
other legislation placing age restrictions on the purchase of otc products containing dextromethorphan was passed at the local level by suffolk county  new york  westchester county  new york  nassau county  new york and by the city of jerseyville  illinois 
it is possible that other local  state or the federal government could introduce and pass legislation imposing additional or different restrictions on the sale of dextromethorphan in finished dosage form  such as requiring a minimum age to purchase product 
the company cannot predict whether any of the proposed legislation will be passed or  if it is passed  its impact on future revenues attributable to these products 
the fda held a meeting of the drug safety and risk management advisory committee on september  to discuss the potential abuse of the drug dextromethorphan and the public health benefits and risks of dextromethorphan use as a cough suppressant in prescription and nonprescription drug products 
in a vote  an fda advisory panel voted not to restrict dextromethorphan cough medications to prescription only 
it is possible the fda could still recommend in the future that dextromethorphan containing products be considered a scheduled substance  which would remove their status as an otc product 
the company cannot predict the likelihood of such activity by the fda or any adverse impact such activity may have on the company results of operations 
in fiscal  products containing dextromethorphan generated revenues of approximately million 
acetaminophen the company manufactures several products that contain the active ingredient acetaminophen  which is indicated as an analgesic 
in june  the fda held a public advisory committee meeting to discuss how to address the potential for liver injury related to the risk of overdose of acetaminophen in both otc and rx products 
the fda expressly stated that the risk of developing liver injury to the individual patient who uses the drug according to directions is extremely low and that it is not seeking to remove acetaminophen from the market 
however  due to the extensive use of acetaminophen containing products  the fda sought guidance from several advisory committees regarding measures to reduce the potential for liver injury associated with acetaminophen use 
measures discussed include  but were not limited to  reducing the maximum single dose and daily dose  reducing packaging sizes  and increasing consumer educational efforts regarding such products 
at a may meeting of the fda nonprescription drugs advisory committee and pediatric advisory committee to review efforts to reduce medication errors around the use of single ingredient pediatric acetaminophen  the fda joint committees unanimously voted in support of the addition to the label of weight based dosing for children ages two to twelve  that the pharmacokinetic pk  safety and efficacy data would be required to support the addition of new label directions for children six months to two years of age  and that the new labeling for children six months to two years of age include the indication for fever reduction 
the committees did not support an indication in labeling for children six months to two years of age for relief of pain  this indication is currently included for children over two years of age 
the fda is reviewing the input it received from the advisory committees and additional comments submitted through the docket 
in fiscal  products containing acetaminophen generated revenues of approximately million for the company 
the company cannot predict whether the fda will adopt any recommendations of the advisory committees regarding the sale and use of acetaminophen or whether any such recommendations  if adopted by the fda  would impact future revenues attributable to these products 
unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of the company products and any similar products distributed by other companies could have a material adverse impact on the company business 
the company is dependent upon consumers perception of the safety and quality of its products 
negative consumer perception may arise from media reports  product liability claims  regulatory investigations or recalls  regardless of whether such media reports  claims  investigations or recalls involve the company or its products 
the mere publication of information asserting defects in products or ingredients or concerns about the company products or the raw materials used in the company products could have a material adverse effect on the company  regardless of whether such information is scientifically supported 
for example  any major outbreak of illness or disease in cows could lead to a serious loss of consumer confidence in  and demand for  dairy products  including the company infant formula products 
adverse publicity about these types of concerns  whether valid or not  may negatively impact consumer perceptions and may discourage consumers from buying one or more of the company products  such that the company sales may decline and the company may suffer losses in its business 
the company may incur liabilities or experience negative reputational effects as a result of any real or perceived quality issues with the company products 
the company products involve risks such as product contamination  spoilage  mislabeling and tampering that could require the company to recall one or more of its products 
serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against the company that  among other things  could result in the suspension of production or distribution of the company products  product seizures  loss of certain licenses  delays in the issuance of governmental approvals for new products or other governmental penalties 
adverse publicity or negative public perception regarding the quality of the company products  particular ingredients  or the industries in which the company competes could result in a substantial decrease in demand for the company products 
the company cannot guarantee that counterfeiting  imitation  or other tampering with its products will not occur or that the company will be able to detect and resolve it if it happens 
any occurrence of counterfeiting or contamination could negatively impact sales of the company products  particularly if counterfeit or imitation products cause death or injury to consumers of those products 
additionally  powdered infant formula products are not sterile 
all of the company infant formula products must be prepared and maintained according to label instruction to retain their flavor and nutritional value and avoid contamination or deterioration 
depending on the product  a risk of contamination or deterioration may exist at each stage of the production cycle  including the purchase and delivery of raw materials  the processing and packaging of food products  and the use and handling by consumers  hospital personnel and health care professionals 
in the event that certain of the company infant formula products are found or alleged to have suffered contamination or deterioration  whether or not such products are under the company control  the company reputation and its infant formula product category could be materially adversely affected 
the company infant formula product category is subject to changing consumer preferences and health and nutrition related concerns 
the company results of operations depend  in part  on consumer preferences and choices  including the number of mothers who choose to use infant formula products rather than breastfeed their babies 
to the extent that private  public and government sources may promote the benefits of breastfeeding over the use of infant formula  there could be a reduced demand for infant formula products  and the company infant formula products business could be adversely affected 
in addition  during fiscal  the company transitioned the majority of its infant formula products into new plastic packaging  following the leading us brands that had made the transition to plastic packaging over the last several years 
the company believes that future growth in its infant formula volume in store brand market share will be enabled through the recent launch of its new plastic container offering 
to the extent that this new packaging is not accepted by consumers  the company infant formula products business could be adversely affected 
the company infant formula product category may also be affected by medical research relating to the healthfulness of cow milk in the human diet 
for example  adverse research may raise concerns about the fat  cholesterol  calorie  sodium and lactose content or contamination of dairy products  including infant formula 
any significant shift in consumer preference away from the use of infant formula may materially and adversely affect the results of operations of the company infant formula product category 
additionally  the company infant formula product category could be adversely impacted by an increase in the number of families that are provided with infant formula by the federal government through the women  infants and children program  as the company does not participate in this program 
the company believes that growth in the nutritional products business is based largely on national media attention regarding scientific research suggesting potential health benefits from regular consumption of certain vitamin and other nutritional products 
there can be no assurance of future favorable scientific results and media attention  or the absence of unfavorable or inconsistent findings 
in the event of future unfavorable scientific results or media attention  the company sales of nutritional products could be materially adversely impacted 
although the company only enters into business acquisitions and divestitures that it expects will result in benefits to the company  the company may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges  which could have a material adverse effect on the company stock price or operating results 
as part of the company strategy  it evaluates potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business  some of which could be and have been material 
potential acquisition targets are evaluated on whether they have the capacity to deliver a return on invested capital roic in excess of to percentage points over the company s weighted average cost of capital wacc within three years 
acquisitions  including the proposed transactions involving elan  involve a number of risks and present financial  managerial and operational challenges  including uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities of  the respective parties  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the consummation of financing transactions  acquisitions or dispositions and the related effects on the company business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies from an acquisition in the amounts and on the timeframe  problems that could arise from the integration of the respective businesses  including the application of internal control processes to the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry  market  or general economic conditions that differ from the assumptions underlying the company rationale for pursuing the transaction 
any one or more of these factors could cause the company not to realize the benefits anticipated from a transaction 
moreover  any acquisition opportunities the company pursues could materially affect its liquidity and capital resources and may require the company to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
future acquisitions could also result in the company assuming more long term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets than it has assumed in its previous acquisitions 
further  acquisition accounting rules require evaluation of certain assumptions  estimates or determination of financial statement classifications which are completed during the measurement period as defined in current accounting standards 
accounting policies of the company and acquisition accounting rules may materially vary from those of the acquired company 
any changes in assumptions  estimates or financial statement classifications may be material and have a material adverse effect on the assets  liabilities or future earnings of the new combined consolidated company 
in addition  integration activities may place substantial demands on the company management  operational resources and financial and internal control systems 
customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business  technology  service or product could also have a material adverse effect on the company reputation and business 
the company failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have a negative effect on its operations 
integration risks and synergies associated with the company acquisitions are likely to include  but are not limited to  sales force  sales channel or product portfolio rationalization  manufacturing  distribution and supply chain integration and purchasing savings  quality and regulatory process standardization  and information technology and administration shared service implementations 
the dedication of management resources to such integration may detract attention from the company day to day business  and there can be no assurance that there will not be substantial costs associated with the transaction process or other material adverse effects as a result of these integration efforts 
in addition  a lack of performance of acquisitions could cause financial difficulties 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company acquired sergeant and cobrek 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired rosemont 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired velcera and a product portfolio from fera 
the company also evaluates the performance of all operating business units against an roic threshold 
underperforming assets typically have a specific period to improve performance before other strategic alternatives are considered 
the company inability to successfully divest or sell assets in a timely manner could have a negative effect on its operations 
in addition  the process of divestitures could cause strains on the ongoing operations of the company 
changes in estimates regarding fair value of goodwill or intangible assets may result in an adverse impact on the company results of operations 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the company testing in fiscal resulted in no impairment charges related to goodwill 
other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships  non compete agreements  in process research and development ipr d and trade names and trademarks 
certain trade names and trademarks  as well as ipr d assets  are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
any significant change in market conditions  estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairment in the period that the change becomes known 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding impairment of intangible assets 
federal and state health care reform may have an adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
increasing expenditures for health care have been the subject of considerable public attention in north america  israel and many european countries 
both private and governmental entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain health care costs 
in many countries where the company currently operates  pharmaceutical prices are subject to regulation 
in the us  numerous proposals that would effect changes in the us health care system and the pharmaceutical industry have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that could include  but not be limited to  intellectual property  regulatory  antitrust  drug pricing and product liability issues 
similar activities are taking place throughout europe 
as a result of governmental budgetary constraints  the israel ministry of health and the major israeli health funds have sought to further reduce healthcare costs by  among other things  applying continuous pressure to reduce pharmaceutical prices and inventory levels 
the company cannot predict the nature of the measures that may be adopted  how they will be interpreted by the courts or the administrative agencies charged with enforcing them or their impact on the marketing  pricing and demand for its products 
federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer  as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for the manufacturer drugs under medicaid and medicare part b  must enter into a rebate agreement with the federal government to pay rebates to state medicaid programs for the manufacturer covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state medicaid program 
the cms is responsible for administering the medicaid rebate agreements between the federal government and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
rebates are due on the utilization of medicaid managed care organizations  as well as under fee for service arrangements 
the company has a medicaid rebate agreement in effect with the federal government 
federal and or state governments have enacted and are expected to continue to enact measures aimed at reducing the cost of drugs to such governmental payers as well as the public  including health reform legislation enacted in management cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on the company profitability 
various states have in recent years also adopted supplemental drug rebate programs that are intended to provide the individual states with additional manufacturer rebates on medicaid utilization over and above those required under a manufacturer federal medicaid agreement 
states also have created drug coverage and corresponding manufacturer rebate programs for non medicaid populations  known as state pharmaceutical assistance programs 
these rebate programs are generally designed to mimic the federal drug rebate program in terms of how the manufacturer rebates are calculated 
although there are a number of supplemental and state pharmacy assistance rebate programs  for the company they are insignificant in the aggregate compared to its medicaid drug rebate obligations 
cms rules require pharmaceutical companies to calculate and report the amp to cms on a monthly as well as a quarterly basis 
in addition to using this information to calculate rebates  cms is preparing to use amp to calculate a type of federal ceiling on reimbursement rates for multiple source drugs to pharmacies under the medicaid program  known as the ful 
prior to using amp  cms typically used pricing data from third party compendia  such as the awp or wac  in the calculation of fuls 
health reform legislation enacted in amended the statutory definition of amp and also amended the definition of multiple source drug in a manner that materially affects the calculation of fuls 
cms has begun posting draft amp based ful reimbursement files on the cms website that are calculated based on the requirements of the health reform legislation 
currently  the ful reimbursement files are for review and comment only  however  cms has announced that it plans to publish final fuls after a period of releasing them in draft format 
cms issued a proposed rule in february that provided guidance on the revised amp definition and calculation of fuls but has not issued a final rule 
separately  under existing statutory authority granted by the deficit reduction act of  cms has begun collecting retail survey price information from retail community pharmacies to generate publicly available pricing files 
cms expects that the pricing files will provide state medicaid agencies with an array of covered outpatient drug prices concerning retail pharmacy acquisition costs and consumer purchase prices and that state agencies can use this information to compare their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates to those derived from the surveys 
cms has begun posting drafts of this retail survey price information in the form of draft nadac files  which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs  and narp files  which reflect retail community pharmacy prices to consumers 
currently  the retail survey price information files are for review and comment only 
the company does not know how the new methodologies for calculating amp and fuls or the retail survey price information will affect the company pharmacy customers or to what extent these customers will seek to pass on any decrease in medicaid reimbursements to the company 
the company cannot predict how the sharing of weighted average monthly amp data and retail survey prices may impact competition in the marketplace 
if the company is unable to successfully obtain the necessary quota for controlled substances and list chemicals  there is risk of delayed product launches or failure to meet commercial supply obligations 
if the company is unable to comply with regulatory requirements for controlled substances and list chemicals  the dea may take regulatory actions  resulting in temporary or permanent interruption of distribution  withdrawal of products from the market or other penalties 
controlled substances and list chemicals are subject to dea regulation under the controlled substances act 
dea quota requirements can limit the amount of controlled substances and list chemicals a manufacturer may produce  the amount of api it may use to manufacture those products and the amount of controlled substance products and list chemicals a packager may package 
if the company is unable to successfully obtain the quota amounts  there is the risk of delayed launches or failure to meet commercial supply obligations 
in addition  failure to comply with the above laws and requirements can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on the company business  results of operations and financial condition 
the dea may seek civil penalties  refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations 
in certain circumstances  violations could result in criminal proceedings 
if the company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time  it may lose market share  and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
the company understands that maintaining high levels of customer service requires the company to be able to deliver high quality products to its customers on a timely basis 
from time to time  the company may experience interruptions and challenges to its customer service levels due to a variety of factors that may arise 
recently  as some of the company competitors have experienced production problems or have suspended production altogether  the company has experienced significant increases in the volume of customer orders in certain product categories 
additionally  recent enhancements to the company quality assurance systems constrained the pace of some of the company production output for a limited period of time 
if the company is unable to maintain adequately high levels of customer service over time  due to these factors or otherwise  the company may lose market share  and its business and operating results may be materially adversely affected 
if the company cannot continue to rapidly develop  manufacture and market innovative products that meet customer requirements for performance  safety and cost effectiveness  it may lose market share and its revenues may be negatively impacted 
the company future results of operations depend  to a significant degree  upon its ability to successfully commercialize additional otc and generic prescription drugs and or innovative pharmaceuticals  infant formulas and api 
all pharmaceutical products must meet regulatory standards and or receive regulatory approvals 
the company must prove that the anda or nda drug products are bioequivalent to their branded counterparts  which typically requires bioequivalency studies or even more extensive clinical trials to demonstrate efficacy of topical products 
the development and commercialization process  particularly with respect to innovative products  is both time consuming and costly and involves a high degree of business risk 
products currently under development  if and when fully developed and tested  may not perform as expected  may not pass required bioequivalence studies or may be the subject of intellectual property challenges  and necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained in a timely manner  if at all  and the company may not be able to successfully and profitably produce and market such products 
delays in any part of the process or the company inability to obtain regulatory approval of its products including products developed by others to which the company has exclusive marketing rights could adversely affect operating results by restricting or delaying its introduction of new products 
even upon the successful development of a product  the company customer failure to launch a product could adversely affect operating results 
the fda could impose higher standards and additional requirements  such as requiring more supporting data and clinical data than previously required  in order to gain fda clearance to launch new formulations into the market 
continuous introductions of new products and product categories are critical to the company business 
product margins may decline over time due to the products aging life cycles  changes in consumer choice or developments in new drug delivery technology 
therefore  new product introductions are necessary for maintenance of the company current financial condition  and if the company fails to introduce and market new products  the effect on its financial results could be materially adverse 
the company contracts with clinical research organizations cros to conduct various studies that are used to support the company new product development program 
during the third quarter of fiscal  certain of the cros used by the company began bankruptcy or receivership proceedings  including pracs institute  llc  pracs institute canada bc ltd  comprehensive clinical development  inc  and their related entities 
it is uncertain what  if any  impact these insolvency proceedings may have on the ability of those cros to deliver their study results to the company or on the company ability to rely on research performed by those cros 
to the extent those cros cannot deliver their study results to the company or the company cannot rely  in whole or in part  on the research conducted by those cros  it may delay the launch of new products  which could have a material adverse impact on the company future operating results 
these situations are unique and therefore it is uncertain what will be the position of the fda towards the studies conducted by these now bankrupt cros 
the fda may be limited in its ability to inspect the study facilities or gain access to source study documents which may result in the company having to repeat biostudies 
if these scenarios occur  it would result in approval delays 
the company investment in research and development is expected to increase above recent levels due to the company ongoing broadening of its otc  anda or nda  generic prescription and specialty api product portfolio  as well as several opportunities for new products that are switching or are anticipated to be switching from rx to otc status 
the ability to attract scientists proficient in emerging delivery forms and or contracting with a third party in order to generate new products of this type is a critical element of the company long term plans 
should the company fail to attract qualified employees  successfully develop products in a timely manner  or enter into reasonable agreements with third parties  long term sales growth and profit would be adversely impacted 
changes in the company credit ratings may limit its access to capital and materially increase borrowing costs 
in may  the company issued million unsecured notes in a public offering 
in conjunction with the offering  the company received ratings from moody investor service and standard and poor rating services 
any changes or downgrades to the company credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the company access to capital markets and the perception of the company credit risk by lenders and other third parties 
the company credit ratings are based upon information furnished by the company or obtained by a rating agency from its own sources and are subject to revision  suspension or withdrawal by one or more rating agencies at any time 
rating agencies may review the ratings assigned to the company due to developments that are beyond the company control  including the introduction of new standards requiring the agencies to re assess rating practices and methodologies 
any downgrade to the ratings of the company debt securities may result in higher interest costs for certain of the company credit facilities and other debt financings  and could result in higher interest costs on future financings 
further  downgrades may impact the company ability to obtain adequate financing  including via trade payables with vendors 
customers inclination to purchase goods from the company may also be affected by the publicity associated with deterioration of the company credit ratings 
the company manufactures spot on pesticides for the monthly control of fleas  ticks  or other external parasites in dogs and cats 
these products are safe and effective when used in accordance with label directions  however  pesticide ingredients may cause harm to animals and humans if used improperly 
additional regulation may be enacted to mitigate improper uses of these ingredients  which could have an adverse impact on the company sales of such products and resulting income 
in spring  the epa noticed an increase in pet incidents being reported involving spot on pesticide products for pets 
the epa received a large amount of information on individual reported adverse pet incidents from the companies that hold registrations for these products called the registrants 
the epa also reviewed other information that was submitted 
the epa formed an expert veterinarian team to thoroughly analyze the data 
the epa also partnered with the food and drug administration center for veterinary medicine cvm and canada pest management regulatory agency pmra on the review of this analysis 
the team studied incidents involving cats and dogs  looked at both active and inert ingredients  studied product labeling  and discussed data needs for the future to improve analyses and regulation 
the epa found that the products could be used safely but that some additional restrictions are needed 
the epa team of veterinarians learned that most incidents were minor  but unfortunately there were some pet deaths and major incidents reported 
the epa learned that the most commonly affected organ systems were dermal  gastrointestinal  and nervous 
recommendations to reduce harmful effects include addressing concerns about dosing  improving labeling to avoid confusion between dog and cat products  making labels more understandable with larger fonts and pictograms  addressing uncertainties about the inert ingredients in these products  imposing conditions of registration when granting amendments to existing products or granting new registrations  requiring more standardized reporting on adverse effects and sales  changing data requirements for pre market clinical trials and implementing a formal post market surveillance program 
future pet spot on registrations and amendments to new registrations will be restricted by appropriate conditions and time limitations to allow the epa to continue to ensure the safety of these products after they are available to the public 
the epa mitigation efforts for educating consumers and reducing misuse are ongoing 
the company cannot predict whether further label restrictions may be required  or whether additional regulations may be passed  or to the extent of the adverse impact additional restrictions or regulations may have on the company results of operations 
the company quarterly results are impacted by a number of factors  some of which are beyond the control of management  that may result in significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in operating results 
the company quarterly operating results depend on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the severity  length and timing of the cough cold flu season and flea and tick season  the timing of new product approvals and introductions by the company and its competitors  price competition  changes in the regulatory environment  the magnitude and timing of research and development investments  changes in the levels of inventories maintained by the company customers and the timing of retailer promotional programs 
accordingly  the company may be subject to significant and unanticipated quarter to quarter fluctuations in its operating results 
the competitive markets in which the company operates could lead to reduced demand for its products in favor of its competitors products  which could negatively impact its sales  gross margin  and prospects 
the markets for otc pharmaceutical  animal health  nutritional  infant formula  generic pharmaceutical and api products are highly competitive 
competition is based primarily on price  quality and assortment of products  customer service  marketing support and availability of new products 
competition also comes from national brand companies and branded pharmaceutical companies 
that competition could be intensified should those companies lower prices or manufacture their own store brand or generic equivalent products 
due to the high degree of price competition  the company has not always been able to fully pass on cost increases to its customers 
the inability to pass on future cost increases  the impact of store brand competitors and the impact of national brand companies lowering prices of their products  offering special promotional discounts or operating in the store brand market could have a material adverse impact on financial results 
the company also sells nationally branded animal health products 
the animal health segment has seen a dramatic increase in the direct to consumer advertising of several branded competitors 
the company may see an increase in competition as more competitors increase national advertising expenditures 
as additional companies come to market with product registrations similar to the company  pricing strategies or marketing support may need to become more competitive 
in addition  since the company sells its nutritional products through retail drug  supermarket and mass merchandise chains  it may experience increased competition in its nutritional products business through alternative channels such as health food stores  direct mail and direct sales as more consumers obtain products through these channels 
the company has evaluated  and will continue to evaluate  the products and product categories in which it does business 
future product line extensions  or deletions  could have a material impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
selling prices of generic drugs typically decline  sometimes dramatically  as competition intensifies due to additional companies receiving approvals for a given product or brands launching authorized generics 
to the extent that the company succeeds in being the first to market a generic version of a significant product  the company sales and profit can be substantially increased in the period following the introduction of such product and prior to a competitor introduction of an equivalent product 
the company ability to sustain its sales and profitability on any product over time is dependent on both the number of new competitors for such product  some of whom may be significantly larger than the company  and the timing of their approvals 
certain competitors are choosing to consolidate in the generic pharmaceutical and nutritional industries 
these consolidations may create larger companies with which the company must compete and provide further pressure on prices  development activities or customer retention 
the impact of future consolidation in the industry could have a material impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
the company api business is subject to increased competition from other manufacturers of api located in europe and developing countries  such as india and china 
such competition may result in loss of api customers and or decreased profitability in this business segment 
the company success is dependent  in large part  on continued store brand growth for its otc and nutritionals products  which is influenced by factors outside management control 
there can be no assurance that store brand products will continue to grow and failure to achieve continued growth may adversely impact the company sales and resulting financial condition 
the future growth of domestic store brand products will be influenced  in part  by general economic conditions  which can influence consumers to switch to and from store brand products  consumer perception and acceptance of the quality of the products available  the development of new products and or product delivery forms  the market exclusivity periods awarded on rx to otc switch products and the ongoing or growing strength of the retailers brands in the market 
the otc business does not advertise like the national brand companies and thus is largely dependent on retailer promotional activities to drive sales volume and increase market share 
growth opportunities for the products in which the company currently has a significant store brand market share cough cold flu allergy  analgesic  smoking cessation and gastrointestinal products will be driven by the ability to offer new products to existing domestic customers 
branded pharmaceutical companies may use state and federal regulatory and legislative means to limit the availability of brand equivalent products 
should store brand growth be limited by any of these factors  there could be a significant adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
lack of availability of  or significant increases in the cost of  raw materials used in manufacturing the company products could adversely impact its profit margins and operating results 
affordable high quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of the company business units due to the nature of the products the company manufactures 
raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers 
supplies of certain raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods purchased by the company are limited  or are available from one or only a few suppliers 
in these situations  increased prices  rationing and shortages can occur 
in response to these problems the company tries to identify alternative materials or suppliers for such raw materials  bulk tablets and finished goods 
fda requirements for products approved through the anda or nda process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate material source 
certain material shortages and approval of alternate sources could adversely affect financial results 
the rapid increase in cost of many raw materials from inflationary forces  such as increased energy costs  and the company ability or inability to pass on these increases to its customers  could have a material impact on the company financial results 
the company maintains several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to regulatory  performance  quality  support  or price considerations 
unavailability or delivery delays of single source components or products could adversely affect the company ability to ship the related product in a timely manner 
the effect of unavailability or delivery delays would be more severe if associated with the company higher volume or more profitable products 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualifying the alternate suppliers and establishing reliable supplies could cost more or result in delays and a loss of revenues 
as a result  the loss of a single source supplier could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations 
in addition  raw materials purchased from third parties  including those from foreign countries  may contain counterfeit ingredients or other adulterants 
the company maintains a strict program of verification and product testing throughout the ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process to identify potential counterfeit ingredients  adulterants and toxic substances 
nevertheless  discovery of previously unknown problems with the raw materials or product manufacturing processes or new data suggesting an unacceptable safety risk associated therewith  could result in a voluntary or mandatory withdrawal of the contaminated product from the marketplace  either temporarily or permanently 
any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to the company  and may give rise to product liability litigation  either of which could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the company 
the company infant formula products require certain key raw ingredients that are derived from raw milk  such as skim milk powder  whey protein powder and lactose 
the company supply of milk based ingredients may be limited by the ability of individual dairy farmers and cooperatives to provide raw milk in the amount and quality necessary to meet the needs of the company infant formula product category 
raw milk production is influenced by factors beyond the company control  including seasonal factors  such as dairy cows producing more milk in temperate weather than hot or cold weather  drought and extended unseasonably hot or cold weather potentially leading to lower than expected supplies  environmental factors  such as the volume and quality of milk produced by dairy cows being linked closely to the quality of nourishment provided by the surrounding environment  governmental agricultural and environmental policy  such as government grants  subsidies  land provisions  technical assistance  and other agricultural and environmental policies having a direct effect on the viability of individual dairy farmers and dairy farmer cooperatives and the number of dairy cows and quantities of milk they are able to produce and global demand for milk and key ingredients derived from milk 
the company cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient supplies of these key ingredients derived from raw milk 
any disruption in the supply of these key ingredients derived from raw milk could adversely and materially impact the company infant formula product category 
the company products  and the raw materials used to make those products  generally have limited shelf lives 
the company inventory levels are based  in part  on expectations regarding future sales 
the company may experience build ups in inventory if sales slow 
any significant shortfall in sales may result in higher inventory levels of raw materials and finished products  thereby increasing the risk of inventory spoilage and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs  which may materially and adversely affect the company results of operations 
cargo thefts and or diversions and economically or maliciously motivated product tampering on store shelves may be experienced from time to time  causing unexpected shortages 
additionally  the fda is beginning to scrutinize claims on infant formula labels 
labeling changes required for regulatory compliance could render packaging inventories obsolete 
the costs  both financially and in regard to management attention  of combating legal proceedings could have an adverse impact on the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  the company and or its subsidiaries become involved in lawsuits arising from various commercial matters  including  but not limited to  competitive issues  contract issues  intellectual property matters  false advertising unfair competition  taxation matters  workers compensation  product liability  environmental remediation issues and state or federal regulatory issues 
see the notes to the company annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements incorporated herein 
litigation is unpredictable and can be costly 
no assurance can be made that litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company financial position or results of operations in the future 
similarly  judicial decisions in proceedings to which the company is not a party may result in the setting of legal precedent that could affect the future operation of the company business 
in addition  the company may face environmental exposures including  for example  those relating to discharges from and materials handled as part of its operations  the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances or wastes  and the health and safety of its employees 
while the company does not have any material remediation liabilities currently outstanding  the company may in the future face liability for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or petroleum products on  under  or in its currently or formerly owned property  or from a third party disposal facility that it may have used  without regard to whether the company knew of  or caused  the presence of the contaminants 
the actual or alleged presence of  or failure to remediate properly  these substances could have adverse effects  including  for example  substantial investigative or remedial obligations and limitations on the ability to sell or rent affected property or to borrow funds using affected property as collateral 
there can be no assurance that environmental liabilities and costs will not have a material adverse effect on the company financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company may also be subject to liability if its products violate or are alleged to violate applicable laws or regulations in the jurisdictions where such products are distributed or in the event that its products cause or are alleged to cause injury  illness  or death 
the successful assertion of product liability claims against the company could result in potentially significant monetary damages and diversion of management resources  and require the company to make significant payments and incur substantial legal expenses 
even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful  not merited  or not fully pursued  the company may still incur substantial legal expenses defending against such a claim  and the company reputation may suffer 
court rulings limiting the application of federal preemption may have an adverse effect on the company operations as a result of a potential increase in litigation exposure 
on january   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit issued a decision in gaeta v 
perrigo  reversing a lower court decision that the plaintiff state law causes of action were preempted by the ffdca to the extent that they were based on an alleged lack of adequate warning 
in its decision  the ninth circuit stated that it joined the fifth and eighth circuits in concluding that the us supreme court decision in wyeth v 
levine  s 
ct concluding that the federal regulatory regime governing pharmaceuticals does not preempt state law failure to warn claims against brand name manufacturers extends with equal force to claims against generic manufacturers 
on june   the company filed a writ of certioriari with the united states supreme court seeking an appeal of the ninth circuit ruling in the gaeta case 
subsequently  the us supreme court recently addressed the issue of whether state law failure to warn claims against generic prescription drug manufacturers for failing to modify their labeling to include warnings that differ from the name brand equivalent are automatically preempted by the fdca requirement that the label for a generic drug be the same as the label for the brand name counterpart in the following three cases from the fifth and eighth circuits pliva v 
mensing   actavis v 
mensing   and actavis v 
demahy  collectively  referred to as pliva v 
mensing 
these cases were consolidated for review 
on june   in a reversal of the decisions of the fifth and eighth circuits  the us supreme court issued its decision in pliva v 
mensing and ruled that state law tort claims against generic manufacturers were preempted because the federal statutes and federal regulations required the same warning label as that approved by the fda for the brand name drug 
with the reversal of the decisions of the fifth and eighth circuits  the company and other manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products otc and rx retain their ability to dismiss certain failure to warn claims based on federal preemption 
based on the us supreme court recent decision in pliva v 
mensing  which reversed the decisions on preemption that were relied upon by the ninth circuit  the us supreme court remanded the case back to the ninth circuit to be decided consistent with the court decision in pliva v 
mensing 
upon remand  the ninth circuit affirmed the decision of the lower court that state law causes of action were preempted by the ffdca 
changes in tax laws or income tax rates could have a material adverse effect on the company results of operations and the ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner 
a number of factors may adversely impact the company future effective tax rates  such as income tax rate changes by governments  the jurisdictions in which the company profits are determined to be earned and taxed  changes in the valuation of the company deferred tax assets and liabilities  adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns  adjustments to the company interpretation of transfer pricing standards  changes in available tax credits  grants and other incentives  changes in stock based compensation expense  changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws eg  proposals for fundamental eg international tax reform  changes in us generally accepted accounting principles  expiration or the inability to renew tax rulings or tax holiday incentives  and the repatriation of non us earnings with respect to which the company has not previously provided for us taxes 
a change in the company effective tax rate due to any of these factors may adversely impact the company future results from operations 
also  changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the company ability to utilize cash in a tax efficient manner 
because the company depends upon certain customers for a significant portion of its sales  the company sales and income would be adversely affected by a disruption of its relationship with these customers or any material adverse change in these customers business 
the company believes its primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current marketplace of the retail drug industry 
sales to the company largest customer  walmart  comprised approximately of fiscal net sales 
should walmart current relationship with the company change adversely  the resulting loss of business could have a material adverse impact on the company financial position and results of operations 
in addition  while no other customer individually comprises more than of total net sales  the company does have other significant customers 
if the company relationship with one or more of these other customers  including the terms for doing business with the customers  changes significantly  it could have a material adverse impact on the company financial position and results of operations 
changes in supply relationships with the company customers  such as alternate sources for products  withholding new product introductions and or development of customer store brand programs  could have a material adverse impact on the company financial position and results of operations 
maintaining the supply relationships with the company customers is critical to its success 
if the company is unable to deliver to expected customer service levels  customers may choose to assess penalties  obtain alternate sources for products  withhold new product introductions and or end the relationship with the company 
the success in recent years of private label marketing programs has increased large retailers attention to the importance of their store brand programs  and as a result  many are dedicating significant resources to auditing supplier compliance with their quality  ethical and service standards 
customers may limit the level of product sourcing with the company in protection of the customer own interests 
any or all of these factors could have a material adverse impact on the company financial position and results of operations 
retailer consolidation can increase the company credit risk  which may adversely affect the company financial position or results of operations 
retailer consolidation continues to inherently increase the size of the company customers 
if a large customer should encounter financial difficulties  the company exposure with respect to uncollectible receivables and unusable inventory  as well as the potential loss of future sales  could result in a material adverse impact on the company financial position or results of operations 
conditions in israel affect the company operations and may limit its ability to produce and sell its products 
the company has significant manufacturing and research and development facilities in israel 
political  economic and military conditions in israel directly affect the company operations  and the company could be adversely affected by current or future hostilities involving israel or a significant recession or downturn in the economic or financial condition of israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a number of armed conflicts have taken place between israel and its neighboring countries 
a state of hostility  varying in degree and intensity  has led to security and economic problems for israel in recent years 
these hostilities can adversely affect israel relationship with a number of countries in the region and elsewhere  as well as its relationship with international organizations 
while none of the company facilities in israel have been directly affected by hostile operations  there can be no assurance that a further escalation of hostilities will not impact the company facilities 
furthermore  the company employees in israel include members of the israeli military reserves  some of whom have been called up for active duty 
if a significant number of the company employees in israel are called up for active duty in the military  the company operations in israel may be materially adversely affected 
escalations of hostilities have disruptive effects on israel economy  and any international economic sanctions against israel could further harm israel economy 
these economic developments could have an adverse effect on the company israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products business 
furthermore  certain parties with whom the company does business may decline to travel to israel  which would force the company to make alternative arrangements where necessary 
the united states department of state has at times issued an advisory regarding travel to various sections of israel 
as a result of the state department advisories  the fda has at various times curtailed or prohibited its inspectors from traveling to israel to inspect the facilities of israeli companies  and should this occur with respect to the company israeli facilities  the fda could withhold approval for new products intended to be produced at those facilities 
although it has not yet occurred  the political and security situation in israel may result in certain parties with whom the company has contracts claiming that they are not obligated to perform their commitments pursuant to force majeure provisions of those contracts 
the company could experience disruption of its manufacturing and research and development facilities due to terrorist acts or military actions 
if terrorist acts or military actions were to result in substantial damage to the company facilities  business activities would be disrupted since  with respect to most products  the company would need to obtain prior fda approval for a change in manufacturing site 
the company insurance may not adequately compensate it for losses that may occur and any losses or damages incurred by the company could have a material adverse effect on its business 
some neighboring countries  as well as certain companies and organizations  continue to participate in a boycott of israeli firms and others doing business with israel or with israeli companies 
the company is also precluded from marketing its products to certain of these countries due to us and israeli regulatory restrictions 
because an immaterial amount of the company revenue is currently derived from sales to these countries  the company believes that the boycott has not had a material adverse effect on its current operations 
however  continuation or extension of the boycott or implementation of additional restrictive laws  policies or practices directed towards israel or israeli businesses could have an adverse impact on the expansion of the company business 
changes in global economic conditions may adversely impact the company liquidity and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and the other countries in which the company produces and markets its products continue to be affected by the economic conditions that began with the financial and credit liquidity crisis in late although economic conditions have improved during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  there continues to be uncertainty as to whether this improvement is sustainable 
furthermore  geopolitical issues  sovereign debt issues  and the depressed state of global real estate markets have contributed to increased market volatility 
continued market volatility could adversely affect the company stock price  liquidity and overall financial condition 
the company customers and suppliers may be adversely affected by a worsening of the current economic conditions 
although the company actively reviews the credit worthiness of its customers and suppliers  the company cannot fully predict to what extent its customers and suppliers may be negatively impacted and thus to what extent the company operations would be affected 
the company invests cash and cash equivalents primarily in demand deposits and other short term instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase 
since the advent of the global financial crisis in the first calendar quarter of  the company has maintained a balance between objectives of safety of principal  liquidity and return by investing primarily in us  federal  state and local government obligations  direct obligations of local sovereign governments and in bank obligations of the company credit banks meeting a minimum third party credit rating standard 
the value of the company assets may be adversely affected by a worsening of economic conditions 
although the company lenders have made commitments to make funds available to the company in a timely fashion  if economic conditions worsen or new information becomes publicly available impacting these lenders credit ratings or capital ratios  the company lenders may be unable or unwilling to lend money pursuant to the company existing credit facilities 
in addition  if the company determines that it is appropriate or necessary to raise capital in the future  the cost of raising funds through the debt or equity markets may be more expensive or those markets may be unavailable 
if the company is unable to use its existing credit facilities or raise funds through debt or equity markets  the company liquidity or ability to follow its key growth strategies could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  decreases in personal incomes may have caused consumers to look for and purchase lower priced products  such as generic and store brand products manufactured by the company  as an alternative to higher priced brand name products 
to the extent that this trend has occurred  the company sales could be negatively affected if economic conditions improve and if consumers were enticed to go back to purchasing higher priced brand name products 
the manufacturing of sterile  injectable products is highly exacting and complex  and if the company suppliers encounter production problems  it could have an adverse effect on the company business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company distributes sterile  injectable products that are manufactured by third parties 
the manufacture of sterile  injectable products is highly complex and exacting in part due to strict regulatory and safety requirements and standards that govern both the manufacture and packaging of these types of projects 
failure of the third party manufacturers to maintain strict controls or adherence to procedures may result in product recalls and liability claims  which could adversely affect the company results of operations and reputation 
third party patents and other intellectual property rights may limit the company ability to bring new products to market and may subject the company to potential legal liability 
the failure to bring new products to market in a timely manner without incurring legal liability could cause the company to lose market share and its operating results may suffer 
the company ability to bring new products to market is limited by certain patent  trademark and trade dress factors including  but not limited to  the existence of patents protecting brand products for all business segments and the regulatory exclusivity periods awarded on products 
the cost and time to develop these prescription and switch products is significantly greater than the rest of the new products that the company seeks to introduce 
moreover  the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may have to defend against charges that it violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company defense against charges that it infringed third party patents or proprietary rights could require the company to incur substantial expense and to divert significant effort of its technical and management personnel 
if the company is found to have infringed on the rights of others  it could lose its right to develop or manufacture some products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  the company cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to it on terms it believes to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent the company from manufacturing and selling a number of its products 
at times  the company may seek approval to market nda or anda products before the expiration of patents for those products  based upon its belief that such patents are invalid  unenforceable or would not be infringed by its products 
as a result  the company may face significant patent litigation 
depending upon a complex analysis of a variety of legal and commercial factors  the company may  in certain circumstances  elect to market a generic pharmaceutical product while litigation is pending  before any court decision or while an appeal of a lower court decision is pending 
this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an at risk launch 
the risk involved in an at risk launch can be substantial because  if a patent holder ultimately prevails  the remedies available to the patent holder may include  among other things  damages measured by the profits lost by the holder  which are often significantly higher than the profits the company makes from selling the generic version of the product 
by electing to proceed in this manner  the company could face substantial damages if a final court decision is adverse to the company 
in the case where a patent holder is able to prove that the company infringement was willful or exceptional  the definition of which is subjective  the patent holder may be awarded up to three times the amount of its actual damages 
at the end of the third quarter of fiscal and following a summary judgment ruling of non infringement  the company launched a generic version of mucinex tablets mg from reckitt benckiser prior to the expiration of the relevant patents 
at that time  this was an at risk launch 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the brand dismissed the appeal  and as a result  this is no longer an at risk launch 
the government programs in israel in which the company participates and the tax benefits the company receives require the company to meet several conditions and may be terminated or reduced in the future  which would increase the company costs and tax expenses 
the company has received grants for research and development from the office of the chief scientist in israel ministry of industry and trade 
to continue to be eligible for these grants  the company development projects must be approved by the chief scientist on a case by case basis 
if the company development projects are not approved by the chief scientist  the company will not receive grants to fund these projects  which would increase research and development costs 
the receipt of such grants subjects the company to certain restrictions and pre approval requirements  which may be conditioned on additional royalty payments with rights to transfer intellectual property and or production abroad 
the company also receives tax benefits  in particular exemptions and reductions  as a result of the privileged enterprise status of certain existing operations in israel 
to be eligible for these tax benefits  the company must maintain its privileged enterprise status by meeting conditions  including making specified investments in fixed assets located in specific regions in israel and investing additional equity in itself and its israeli subsidiaries and by meeting projections provided to the regulatory agencies 
if the company fails to meet these conditions in the future  the tax benefits would be canceled  and the company could be required to refund the tax benefits already received 
these tax benefits may not be continued in the future at their current levels or at any level 
if such benefits are reduced or eliminated in the future  the company results of operations will be adversely impacted 
in fiscal  israel enacted new tax legislation that reduced the effective tax rate to for and  for and  and thereafter for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation 
this legislation was rescinded as announced in the official gazette on august  the new legislation enacted a rate for certain qualifying entities that elect to be taxed under the new legislation 
the company has two entities that had previously elected the new tax legislation for years after fiscal therefore  the above risk is only applicable for the company for fiscal year as statutes remain open for this year 
a significant disruption at any of the company main manufacturing facilities could materially and adversely affect the company business  financial position and results of operations 
the company us operations are concentrated in michigan  minnesota  south carolina  new york  vermont  ohio and nebraska 
approximately of the company fiscal revenues are related to these manufacturing facilities 
the company has concentrated manufacturing facilities in israel  which comprise approximately of the company fiscal revenues 
a significant disruption resulting from  but not limited to  fire  tornado  storm  flood  cyber attacks  material supply  insufficient quality  or pandemic at any of the company facilities could impair its ability to develop  produce and or ship products on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial position and operating results 
the success of certain of the company products depends on the effectiveness of measures it takes to protect its intellectual property rights and patents 
the company success with certain of its products depends  in part  on its ability to protect and defend its intellectual property rights 
if the company fails to adequately protect its intellectual property  competitors may manufacture and market similar products 
the company has been issued patents covering certain of its products  and has filed  and expects to continue to file  patent applications seeking to protect newly developed technologies and products in various countries  including the us any existing or future patents issued to or licensed by the company may not provide it with any significant competitive advantages for its products or may even be challenged  invalidated or circumvented by competitors 
in addition  such patent rights may not prevent the company competitors from developing  using or commercializing non infringing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to its products 
the company also relies on trade secrets  unpatented proprietary know how and continuing technological innovation that it seeks to protect  in part by confidentiality agreements with licensees  suppliers  employees and consultants 
if these agreements are breached  the company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
disputes may arise concerning the ownership of intellectual property or the applicability of confidentiality agreements 
furthermore  trade secrets and proprietary technology may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors or  if patents are not issued with respect to products arising from research  the company may not be able to maintain the value of such intellectual property rights 
the company is also increasing its research and development efforts in countries where risks of improper disclosure of trade secrets and proprietary technology are higher than in the united states and israel 
a substantial portion of the sources of raw materials and an increasing volume of sales of the company are outside the united states 
additional legislation or regulation concerning importing exporting may be enacted  which could have an adverse impact on the company net sales of such products and resulting income 
the company imports and exports products and raw materials from to several jurisdictions around the world 
this process involves company subsidiaries and third parties operating in a number of jurisdictions with different customs and import export regulations 
the regulations are subject to change from time to time and the company cannot predict the nature  scope or impact of these changes upon the company operations 
the company is subject to periodic reviews and audits by us and foreign authorities responsible for administering these regulations 
to the extent that the company is unable to successfully defend itself against an audit or review  the company may be required to pay assessments  penalties and increased duties  which may  individually or in the aggregate  negatively impact the company gross margins and operating results 
certain of the company facilities operate in a special purpose subzone established by the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board  which allows the company certain tax advantages on products and raw materials shipped through these facilities 
if the us department of commerce foreign trade zone board were to revoke the subzone designation or limit its use by the company  the company could be subject to increased duties  which may negatively impact the company gross margins and operating results 
conducting business in international markets involves risks and uncertainties such as foreign exchange rate exposure and social  political and economic instability that could lead to increased prices for raw materials  reduced international sales and reduced profitability associated with such sales  which could reduce the company net sales and income 
the company sources certain key raw materials and finished products from foreign suppliers in countries that include  but are not limited to  australia  canada  china  denmark  india and mexico 
the company continues to increase its revenues outside the us the company primary markets for the sale of its products outside the us are canada  germany  israel  mexico  the uk  china and australia 
the company may have difficulty in international markets due  for example  to regulatory barriers  the necessity of adapting to new regulatory systems and problems related to markets with different cultural biases and political systems and strict adherence to all anti corruption laws including the united states foreign corrupt practices act 
violence and crime in mexico could adversely affect the company manufacturing activities and ability to recruit and retain employees there 
sales to customers outside the us and foreign raw material purchases expose the company to a number of risks  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  possible difficulties in enforcing agreements  longer payment cycles  longer shipping lead times  inefficient port operations  exchange rate fluctuations  difficulties obtaining export or import licenses  the imposition of withholding or other taxes  economic or political instability  embargoes  military hostilities or exchange controls 
should any of these risks occur  they may have a material adverse impact on the operating results of the company 
the company is dependent on the services of certain key executive and scientific employees 
the failure to attract and retain such employees may have a material adverse impact on the company results of operations 
the company future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees 
key functions for the company include executive managers  operational managers  research and development scientists  information technology specialists  financial and legal specialists  regulatory professionals  quality compliance specialists and sales marketing personnel 
should the company be unable to attract or retain key qualified employees  future operating results may be adversely impacted 
increasing use of social media could give rise to liability  breaches of data security or reputational damage 
the company and its employees are increasingly utilizing social media tools as a means of communications both internally and externally 
to the extent that the company seeks to use these tools as a means to communicate about its products and or business  there are uncertainties as to either the rules that apply to such communications  or as to the interpretations that authorities will apply to the rules that exist 
as a result  despite the company efforts to monitor evolving social media communication guidelines and comply with applicable rules  there is risk that the company use of social media for such purposes may cause it to be found in violation of them 
in addition  because of the availability of social media tools globally  the company employees may knowingly or inadvertently make use of them in ways that may not be aligned with the company social media strategy  and that may give rise to liability  or could lead to the loss of trade secrets or other intellectual property  or public exposure of personal information including sensitive personal information of the company employees  clinical trial patients  customers and others 
in either case  such uses of social media could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  negative posts or comments about the company or its products in social media could seriously damage its reputation and could adversely affect the price of its securities 
to protect itself against various potential liabilities  the company maintains a variety of insurance programs 
significant increases in the cost or decreases in the availability of such insurance could adversely impact the company financial condition 
the company maintains insurance  including property  general and product liability  and directors and officers liability to protect itself against potential loss exposures 
the company cannot predict whether deductible or retention amounts will increase or whether coverage will be reduced in the future 
to the extent that losses occur  there could be an adverse effect on the company financial results depending on the nature of the loss and the level of insurance coverage maintained by the company 
from time to time  the company may reevaluate and change the types and levels of insurance coverage that it purchases 
the company  like retailers and other distributors and manufacturers of products  is exposed to product liability claims in the event that  among other things  the use of its products results in injury 
there is no assurance that product liability insurance will continue to be available to the company at an economically reasonable cost or at all for certain products or that the company insurance will be adequate to cover liability that the company incurs in connection with product liability claims 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information related to legal proceedings 
the company business requires continuous capital investments and there can be no assurance that financial capital will always be available on favorable terms or at all 
in some instances  the company may determine to issue additional shares of capital stock in order to meet its capital needs  which would dilute existing shareholders ownership 
the company maintains a broad product line to function as a primary supplier for its customers 
capital investments are driven by growth  technological advancements  cost improvement and the need for manufacturing flexibility 
estimation of future capital expenditures could vary materially due to the uncertainty of these factors 
if the company fails to stay current with the latest manufacturing  information and packaging technology  it may be unable to competitively support the launch of new product introductions 
the company anticipates that cash  cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under its credit facilities will substantially fund working capital and capital expenditures 
the company has historically evaluated acquisition opportunities and anticipates that acquisition opportunities will continue to be identified and evaluated in the future 
the historical growth of sales and profits has been positively influenced by acquisitions 
there is no assurance that future sales and profits will  or will not  be impacted by acquisition activities 
the company current capital structure  results of operations and cash flow needs could be materially impacted by acquisitions 
the company senior credit facilities  the agreements governing its senior notes and agreements governing its other indebtedness contain a number of restrictions and covenants that limit the company ability to make distributions or other payments to its investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied 
the company also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
these restrictions could affect the company ability to operate its business and may limit its ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities  such as acquisitions 
if the company does not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its senior credit facilities  agreements governing its senior notes and agreements governing its other indebtedness  the company could be in default under those agreements  and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
any default under the company senior credit facilities or agreements governing its senior notes or other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
if the company indebtedness is accelerated  there can be no assurance that it would be able to repay or refinance its debt or obtain sufficient new financing 
the company has various maturity dates associated with its credit facilities  senior notes and other debt facilities 
there is no assurance that cash  future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of its indebtedness 
further  there is no assurance that future refinancing or renegotiation of the company senior credit facilities  senior notes or other debt facilities  or additional agreements will not have materially different or more stringent terms 
if the company decides to seek additional capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock  existing shareholders ownership may be diluted

executive overview perrigo company the company traces its history back to what was started as a small local proprietor selling medicinals to regional grocers has evolved into a leading global pharmaceutical company that manufactures and distributes more than billion oral solid doses and over billion liquid doses  as well as dozens of other product forms  each year 
the company s mission is to offer quality  affordable healthcare products tm  and it does so across a wide variety of product categories primarily in the us  us  mexico  israel and australia  and distributes into dozens of other markets throughout the world  including canada  china and latin america 
from time to time  the company evaluates its estimates of the allocation of shared service support functions to its reportable segments 
in the first quarter of fiscal  management revised its allocation estimates to better reflect the utilization of shared services by segment 
management believes the update of the allocation estimates results in a more appropriate measure of earnings for each segment 
this change is consistent with how the chief operating decision maker reviews segment results 
prior period results from operations have been updated to reflect the change in the company allocation estimates 
this change had no effect on consolidated results of operations 
the company s fiscal year is a or week period  which ends the saturday on or about june an extra week is required approximately every six years in order to re align the company fiscal reporting dates with the actual calendar months 
fiscal years and were comprised of weeks and ended on june  and june   respectively 
fiscal year was weeks and ended june  using a weekly average  the extra week of operations in fiscal is estimated to have contributed approximately in net sales 
this factor should be considered when comparing the company fiscal and financial results with the company fiscal financial results 
segments the company has four reportable segments  aligned primarily by type of product consumer healthcare  nutritionals  rx pharmaceuticals and api 
in addition  the company has an other category that consists of the israel pharmaceutical and diagnostic products operating segment  which does not individually meet the quantitative thresholds required to be a separately reportable segment 
the consumer healthcare chc segment is the world s largest store brand manufacturer of over the counter otc pharmaceutical products 
major product categories include analgesics  cough cold allergy sinus  gastrointestinal  smoking cessation  and secondary product categories include feminine hygiene  diabetes care and dermatological care 
in addition  the fiscal acquisitions of sergeant pet care products  inc sergeant and velcera  inc 
velcera expanded the company product portfolio into the animal health category 
the chc business markets products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brand products 
the cost to the retailer of a store brand product is significantly lower than that of a comparable nationally advertised brand name product 
generally  the retailers dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product 
the retailer  therefore  can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin 
the consumer benefits by receiving a high quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product 
therefore  the company business model saves consumers on their healthcare spending 
the company  one of the original architects of private label pharmaceuticals  is the market leader for consumer healthcare products in many of the geographies where it currently competes the us  uk  and mexico and is developing its position in australia 
the company market share of otc store brand products has grown in recent years as new products  retailer efforts to increase consumer education and awareness  and economic conditions have directed consumers to the value of store brand product offerings 
the nutritionals segment develops  manufactures  markets and distributes store brand infant and toddler formula products  infant and toddler foods  vitamin  mineral and dietary supplement vms products  and oral electrolyte solution oes products to retailers  distributors and consumers primarily in the us  canada  mexico and china 
similar to the consumer healthcare segment  this business markets store brand products that are comparable in quality and formulation to the national brand products 
the cost to the retailer of a store brand product is significantly lower than that of a comparable nationally advertised brand name product 
the retailer  therefore  can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product yet realize a greater profit margin 
all infant formulas sold in the us are subject to the same regulations governing manufacturing and ingredients under the infant formula act of  as amended 
store brands  which are value priced and offer substantial savings to consumers  must meet the same us food and drug administration fda requirements as the national brands 
substantially all products are developed using ingredients and formulas comparable to those of national brand products 
in most instances  packaging is designed to increase visibility of store brand products and to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products in order to communicate store brand value to the consumer 
the rx pharmaceuticals segment develops  manufactures and markets a portfolio of generic prescription rx drugs primarily for the us market 
the company defines this portfolio as predominantly extended topical and specialty as it encompasses a broad array of topical dosage forms such as creams  ointments  lotions  gels  shampoos  foams  suppositories  sprays  liquids  suspensions  solutions and powders 
the portfolio also includes select controlled substances  injectables  hormones and oral solid dosage forms 
as a result of the recent acquisition of rosemont pharmaceuticals ltd 
rosemont in the third quarter of fiscal  the company expanded its rx product offering into the uk and europe 
rosemont is a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company focused on the manufacturing and marketing of oral liquid formulations 
with the acquisition of a product portfolio from fera pharmaceuticals  llc fera  the company extended its ophthalmic offerings into the rx extended topical space 
the strategy in the rx pharmaceuticals segment is to be the first to market with those new products that are exposed to less competition because they have formulations that are more difficult and costly to develop and launch eg  extended topicals  specialty solutions or products containing controlled substances 
in addition  the rx pharmaceuticals segment offers otc products through the prescription channel referred to as orx marketing 
orx products are otc products that are available for pharmacy fulfillment and healthcare reimbursement when prescribed by a physician 
the company offers over orx products that are reimbursable through many health plans and medicaid and medicare programs 
orx products offer consumers safe and effective remedies that provide an affordable alternative to the higher out of pocket costs of traditional otc products 
the api segment develops  manufactures and markets active pharmaceutical ingredients api used worldwide by the generic drug industry and branded pharmaceutical companies 
the api business identifies apis that will be critical to its pharmaceutical customers future product launches and then works closely with these customers on the development processes 
api development is focused on the synthesis of less common molecules for the us  european and other international markets 
the company is also focusing development activities on the synthesis of molecules for use in its own otc and rx pipeline products 
this segment is undergoing a strategic platform transformation  moving certain production from israel to the acquired api manufacturing facility in india to allow for lower cost production and to create space for other  more complex production in israel 
in addition to general management and strategic leadership  each business segment has its own sales and marketing teams focused on servicing the specific requirements of its customer base 
each of these business segments share research development  supply chain  information technology  finance  human resources  legal and quality services  all of which are directed out of the company s headquarters in allegan  michigan

performance evaluation criteria the company management evaluates business performance using a return on invested capital roic metric 
this includes evaluating performance of business segments  manufacturing locations  product categories and capital projects 
business segment performance is expected to meet or exceed the company weighted average cost of capital wacc each year 
capital expenditures and large projects are required to demonstrate that they will contribute positively to roic in excess of the company wacc 
likewise  potential acquisition targets are evaluated on whether they have the capacity to deliver a roic in excess of basis points over the company wacc within three years 
in addition  improvement in return on capital is incorporated into management long term incentive lti plan 
in order to make the overall roic metric more actionable for the broader operating management team  the metric used in the lti award calculation is linked to return on tangible capital  removing the direct effect of goodwill and acquired intangibles  to place focus on critical business levers which they can directly impact 
both management and the board of directors regularly review corporate and business segment roic calculations as well and the return on tangible capital performance by segment and product category to track year over year improvements and or the actions to achieve performance at or better than the required threshold 
growth strategy and strategic evaluation over recent years  the company has been executing a strategy designed to expand its product offerings through both r d and acquisitions and to reach new healthcare consumers through entry into new markets 
this strategy is accomplished by investing in and continually improving all aspects of the company five strategic pillars high quality  superior customer service  leading innovation  best cost and empowered people 
the concentration of common shared service activities around the world and development of centers of excellence in r d have played an important role in ensuring the consistency and quality of the company s five strategic pillars 
management plans to continue on its strategic path of growing the company organically as well as inorganically 
the company continually reinvests in its own r d pipeline and at the same time also works with partners as necessary to strive to be first to market with new products 
in recent years  the company has grown organically by launching a series of successful new products in the consumer healthcare and rx pharmaceuticals segments 
management expects to continue to grow inorganically through continued expansion into adjacent products  product categories and channels  as well as new geographic markets 
acquisition opportunities are evaluated on the basis of their ability to deliver long term roic for the company 
during fiscal  the company continued its strategic growth through the following product line expansions and acquisitions product launches clobetasol propionate shampoo   the generic version of clobex in august dextromethorphan polistirex  the generic version of delsym extended release oral liquid suspension in august acetylcysteine injection  the authorized generic of acetadote injection in january betamethasone valerate foam  the generic version of luxiq foam in january nicotine polacrilex mini lozenge mg mint flavor and mg mint flavor  the generic equivalent of nicorette mini lozenge in january clobetasol emulsion propionate foam  the generic version of olux e foam in february sergeant pronyl otc flea and tick spray  the value brand of frontline spray in february guaifenesin mg extended release tablets  the generic version of mucinex mg tablets in march trospium chloride extended release tablets  the generic version of sanctura xr tablets in june acquisitions acquisition in october of sergeant  a supplier of animal health products 
the acquisition expanded the company consumer healthcare product portfolio into the animal health category 
acquisition in december of cobrek  a drug development company

acquisition in february of rosemont  a specialty and generic prescription pharmaceutical company 
the acquisition expanded the global presence of the company rx product offering 
acquisition in april of velcera  a manufacturer and marketer of generic pet care products 
the acquisition expanded the company consumer healthcare animal health category 
acquisition in june  of an ophthalmic sterile ointment and solution product portfolio from fera  a specialty pharmaceutical company 
the acquisition expanded the company opthalmic offerings and position within the rx extended topical space 
capital and liquidity the company s goal in managing its capital structure is to provide sufficient liquidity to enable it to pursue its business goals and objectives while optimizing long term flexibility 
over its recent history  the company has placed increased focus on the importance of funding a majority of its core organic objectives through cash flows from operations 
management is incented to achieve improved cash flows from operations through individual segment operating income and working capital targets and strives to achieve annual cash flows from operations greater than net income 
capital expenditures for the last three fiscal years were at higher levels to allow for capacity expansion  quality and technology investments  api strategic transformations and integration of acquisitions 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be at or slightly above fiscal levels to allow for continued manufacturing productivity and capacity projects  quality and technology investments and investments at newly acquired entities 
this estimate does not include any impact of the proposed merger and acquisition involving elan  as previously discussed 
to support its inorganic acquisition strategies  the company seeks to maintain access to a broad range of debt capital markets to optimize cost  flexibility and liquidity 
the company has historically provided shareholder return of capital through its dividend policy  payments under which have increased steadily over recent years 
share repurchases authorized by the company s board of directors are evaluated against alternative uses of cash  such as acquisitions and debt repayments  and when approved are typically made at levels to help offset the dilutive effects of share based compensation awards 
refer to the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and results of operations sections below for a more detailed discussion of the company s capital and liquidity 
events impacting future results in january  a branded competitor in the otc market began to experience certain quality issues at one of its facilities  causing it to temporarily shut down the facility 
due to this situation  the company experienced an increase in demand for its otc products during the second half of fiscal and full year fiscal  which had a positive impact on the consumer healthcare segment net sales and results of operations 
at this time  the branded competitor is in the process of returning to the market with certain products 
the impact on the company future results will largely be determined by the extent of the branded competitor strategies regarding supply chain  manufacturing and marketing as well as the pace at which they are able to regain distribution and consumer market share  each of which may have an impact on the sales for otc products 
over the past several years  the company has been developing the api temozolomide for various finished dose partners in several global markets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company launched temozolomide into the european market 
on february   the company announced that it will exclusively supply teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
teva with the api for the generic version of temodar temozolomide in the us market 
teva will manufacture  market and distribute the product in the us  and the company will share equally with teva in the profitability of the product sold 
teva was the first company to file an anda that contained a paragraph iv certification for temodar 
on january   the united states district court for the district of delaware held that the patent protecting temozolomide was unenforceable 
on march   the fda granted final approval to the teva anda  but teva did not launch the product at that time 
merck appealed the ruling and on november   the appeals court reversed the trial decision  preventing the launch of the teva product 
teva filed a petition for the entire appeals court to rehear the case  and on february  the court denied the motion 
in response  teva filed a petition for certiorari with the united states supreme court that was denied  ending the litigation 
by agreement between teva and merck  teva launched the product on august  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  a branded competitor in the otc market began to experience periodic interruptions of distribution of certain of its products in the adult and pediatric analgesic categories 
these interruptions have included periods of time where supply of certain products has been suspended altogether 
due to this situation  which continued through fiscal  the company experienced an increase in demand for certain adult and pediatric analgesic products 
this increased demand has generally had a positive impact on the consumer healthcare segment s net sales 
at this time  the branded competitor is in the process of returning to the market 
the company is considering this year over year impact in its forward looking sales forecast  but cannot fully predict the extent of consumers reacceptance of the branded products or the extent of the branded competitor marketing activities

consumer healthcare fiscal year percentage change in millions net sales gross profit gross profit operating expenses operating expenses operating income operating income net sales fiscal net sales increased million compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in us sales of existing products of million  primarily in the contract manufacturing  smoking cessation and cough cold categories  million of net sales attributable to the sergeant  velcera and canam acquisitions and new product sales of million  mainly in the cough cold  smoking cessation and gastrointestinal product categories 
the company international locations  primarily the uk  also experienced an increase of million in their existing product sales due primarily to smoking cessation and contract manufacturing sales growth in european markets 
these increases were partially offset by a decline of million in sales of existing products  primarily in the gastrointestinal and analgesics product categories and million in discontinued products 
fiscal net sales increased million compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to new product sales of million  mainly in the cough cold  gastrointestinal  diabetes and dermatological care categories  along with an increase in sales of existing products of approximately million in the cough cold  feminine hygiene and smoking cessation categories 
in addition  incremental net sales attributable to the acquisition of canam were approximately million 
these combined increases were partially offset by a decline of million in sales of existing products within the gastrointestinal  analgesics and contract manufacturing product categories 
the decrease in the gastrointestinal category was driven by competitive pressures on a key product 
the decrease in the analgesics category was driven by a relatively mild cough cold season compared to fiscal in addition  fiscal net sales in the analgesics category benefited from a branded competitor in the otc market experiencing periodic interruptions of distribution of certain of its adult and pediatric analgesic products 
the decrease in the contract manufacturing category was driven by increased competition 
net sales in fiscal were negatively affected by million in unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
gross profit fiscal gross profit increased million compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to gross profit attributable to the net increase in sales of existing products  incremental gross profit attributable to the sergeant  velcera and canam acquisitions and contribution from new product sales 
these increases were partially offset by a one time charge of million to cost of sales as a result of the step up of inventory acquired and sold during fiscal related to the sergeant acquisition 
this one time charge also negatively impacted the gross profit percentage for fiscal  but was entirely offset by favorable product mix 
fiscal gross profit increased million compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to gross profit contribution on new product sales and incremental gross profit attributable to the canam acquisition  partially offset by increased competition on a key product 
the gross profit percentage decreased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to increased competition on a key product 
operating expenses fiscal operating expenses increased million compared to fiscal due primarily to million of incremental operating expenses from the acquisitions of sergeant  velcera and canam 
in addition to the increase due to acquisitions  selling and distribution expenses increased million on higher sales volume 
fiscal operating expenses increased million compared to fiscal the increase  which included million of incremental operating expenses from the acquisition of canam  was related primarily to increases in selling expenses of million and administrative expenses of million 
selling expenses increased due primarily to higher spending on sales and marketing promotions to support the new product launches in fiscal  while administrative expenses increased due to an increase in corporate expenses allocated to the company operating segments 
nutritionals fiscal year percentage change in millions net sales gross profit gross profit operating expenses operating expenses operating income operating income net sales fiscal net sales increased million compared to fiscal due primarily to new product sales of million and a million increase in existing product sales within the vms product category 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in sales of existing products of million  primarily in the infant formula category 
existing product net sales for infant formulas were negatively impacted by a production conversion and ramp up at the company vermont manufacturing facility following the installation of a new plastic container powder infant formula packaging line 
the company has invested approximately million for this new state of the art consumer friendly packaging capability 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  retailers increased purchases in advance of the installation of the new plastic container packaging line and the conversion of the company erp system on july  fiscal net sales decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease was due in part to the transition to next generation formulas within the product portfolio 
this transition resulted in a decline of existing product sales of million  which was largely offset by million in new product sales attributable to the next generation formulas 
existing product sales within the infant formula category were also lower due to the absence of increased demand that the company experienced in the second and third quarters of fiscal as a result of a competitor product recall 
a decline in us birth rates year over year also contributed to lower infant formula existing product sales between periods 
in addition  the vms product category net sales decreased by approximately million due primarily to sku rationalization as a result of increased competition 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales in the infant and toddler foods product category of million 
gross profit fiscal gross profit increased million in line with the net sales increase 
fiscal gross profit decreased million compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to under absorption of fixed production costs relative to lower volume output year over year  along with higher commodity costs  particularly on dairy inputs  and a change in product mix from higher profit formula products to lower profit food products 
the gross profit percentage decreased basis points in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to higher fixed production and commodity costs  as well as the change in product mix 
operating expenses fiscal operating expenses decreased million compared to fiscal due primarily to the absence of million of restructuring charges incurred in the third quarter of fiscal related to the closure of the company florida location 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company florida restructuring plan 
fiscal operating expenses increased million compared to fiscal due primarily to charges incurred as part of the company restructuring plan at its florida facility 
these charges were partially offset by a decrease in administrative expenses due primarily to continued realization of synergies from the pbm acquisition

credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and  therefore  the credit rating assigned to the company by each agency may be subject to revision at any time 
accordingly  the company is not able to predict whether current credit ratings will remain as disclosed above 
factors that can affect the company credit ratings include changes in operating performance  the economic environment  the company financial position  and changes in business strategy 
if further changes in the company credit ratings were to occur  they could impact  among other things  future borrowing costs  access to capital markets  and vendor financing terms 
contractual obligations the company s enforceable and legally binding obligations as of june  are set forth in the following table 
some of the amounts included in this table are based on management s estimates and assumptions about these obligations  including the duration  the possibility of renewal  anticipated actions by third parties and other factors 
because these estimates and assumptions are necessarily subjective  the enforceable and legally binding obligations actually paid in future periods may vary from the amounts reflected in the table 
payment due by period in millions after total operating leases capital leases purchase obligations short and long term debt other non current contractual liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheet deferred compensation and benefits other total used in normal course of business  principally for warehouse facilities and computer equipment 
consists of commitments for both materials and services 
short and long term debt includes interest payments  which were calculated using the effective interest rate at june  includes amounts associated with non qualified plans related to deferred compensation  executive retention and post employment benefits 
of this amount  million has been funded by the company and is recorded in other non current assets on the balance sheet

the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions  which the company expects to be approximately million during fiscal future contributions are dependent upon various factors including employees eligible compensation  plan participation and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included in the contractual obligations table above 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
as of june   the company had approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities 
net deferred income tax liabilities were million as of june  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling net deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
critical accounting estimates determination of certain amounts in the company s financial statements requires the use of estimates 
these estimates are based upon the company s historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
although the estimates are considered reasonable  actual results could differ from the estimates 
the accounting estimates  discussed below  are considered by management to require the most judgment and are critical in the preparation of the financial statements

these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices 
alternatively  the company may pre authorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers 
under either arrangement  the company provides chargeback credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler invoice price 
the accrual for chargebacks is based on historical chargeback experience and confirmed wholesaler inventory levels  as well as estimated sell through levels by wholesalers to retailers 
medicaid rebates the company participates in certain qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector medicaid benefit providers  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
medicaid reserves are based on expected payments  which are driven by patient usage  contract performance  as well as field inventory that will be subject to a medicaid rebate 
medicaid rebates are typically billed up to days after the product is shipped  but can be billed as many as days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the medicaid participant 
as a result  the company medicaid rebate provision includes an estimate of outstanding claims for end customer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed  and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants 
the company calculation also requires other estimates  such as estimates of sales mix  to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates 
returns and shelf stock allowances consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a return policy that allows its customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
generally  product may be returned for a period beginning six months prior to its expiration date to up to one year after its expiration date 
the majority of the company product returns are the result of product dating  which falls within the range set by the company policy  and are settled through the issuance of a credit to the customer 
the company estimate of the provision for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual returns  which is applied to the level of sales for the period that corresponds to the period during which the company customers may return product 
this period is known by the company based on the shelf life of its products at the time of shipment 
additionally  when establishing its reserves  the company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel  product dating and expiration period  size and maturity of the market prior to a product launch  entrance into the market of additional competition and changes in formularies 
shelf stock allowances are credits issued to reflect changes in the selling price of a product and are based upon estimates of the amount of product remaining in a customer inventory at the time of the anticipated price change 
in many cases  the customer is contractually entitled to such a credit 
the allowances for shelf stock adjustments are based on specified terms with certain customers  estimated launch dates of competing products and estimated changes in market price 
rx administrative fees and other rebates rebates or administrative fees are offered to certain wholesale customers  group purchasing organizations and end user customers  consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice 
settlement of rebates and fees may generally occur from one to months from the date of sale

assumptions used to establish the provision include level of wholesaler inventories  contract sales volumes and average contract pricing 
chc nutritionals rebates and other allowances in the chc and nutritionals segments  the company offers certain customers a volume incentive rebate if specific levels of product purchases are made during a specified period 
the accrual for rebates is based on contractual agreements and estimated levels of purchasing 
in addition  the company has a reserve for product returns  primarily related to damaged and unsaleable products 
the company also has agreements with certain customers to cover promotional activities related to the company products 
these activities include coupon programs  new store allowances  product displays and other various activities 
the accrual for these activities is based on customer agreements and is established at the time product revenue is recognized 
allowances for customer related programs are generally recorded at the time of sale based on the estimates and methodologies described above 
the company continually monitors product sales provisions and re evaluates these estimates as additional information becomes available  which includes  among other things  an assessment of current market conditions  trade inventory levels and customer product mix 
the company makes adjustments to these provisions at the end of each reporting period  to reflect any such updates to the relevant facts and circumstances 
current reporting period adjustments to allowance amounts established in prior reporting periods have not historically been material

to the extent such arrangements contain refund clauses triggered by non performance or other adverse circumstances  revenue is not recognized until all contractual obligations are satisfied 
non refundable up front fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the related performance period 
the company estimates the performance period based on the specific terms of each collaborative agreement 
revenue associated with research and development services is recognized on a proportional performance basis over the period that the company performs the related activities under the terms of the agreement 
revenue resulting from the achievement of contingent milestone events stipulated in the agreements is recognized when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are based upon the occurrence of a substantive element specified in the contract 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value

goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows and market valuation multiples 
the estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the company performs its annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment testing for all of its reporting units in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
goodwill was  million at june  and million at june  other intangible assets other intangible assets consist of a portfolio of individual developed product technology formulation and product rights  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships  non compete agreements  in process research and development ipr d and trade names and trademarks 
the assets categorized as developed product technology formulation and product rights  certain distribution and license agreements and non compete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight line method 
customer relationships and certain distribution agreements are amortized on a proportionate basis consistent with the economic benefits derived from those relationships and agreements 
certain trade names and trademarks  as well as ipr d assets  are determined to have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization 
the company  however  reviews them for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that any individual asset might be impaired  and adjusts the carrying value of the asset as necessary 
ipr d assets are initially recognized at fair value and classified as indefinite lived assets until the successful completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any individual asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of an intangible asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
other intangible assets had a net carrying value of  million at june  and million at june  acquisition accounting the company accounts for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting  which requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at fair value  with limited exceptions 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the specifically identified net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
amounts allocated to acquired ipr d are recognized at fair value and initially characterized as indefinite lived intangible assets  irrespective of whether the acquired ipr d has an alternative future use 
if the acquired net assets do not constitute a business  the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition and no goodwill is recognized 
in an asset acquisition  acquired ipr d with no alternative future use is charged to expense at the acquisition date 
the judgments made by management in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of asset acquired and liability assumed can materially impact the company results of operations 
as part of the valuation procedures  the company typically consults an independent advisor 
there are several methods that can be used to determine fair value 
the company typically uses an income approach for valuing its specifically identifiable intangible assets by employing either a relief from royalty or multi period excess earnings methodology 
the relief from royalty method assumes that  if the acquired company did not own the intangible asset or intellectual property  it would be willing to pay a royalty for its use 
the benefit of ownership of the intellectual property is valued as the relief from the royalty expense that would otherwise be incurred 
this method is typically used by the company for valuing readily transferable intangible assets that have licensing appeal  such as trade names and trademarks and certain technology assets 
the multi period excess earnings approach starts with a forecast of the net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its estimated useful life 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
this method is typically used by the company for valuing intangible assets such as developed product technology  customer relationships  product formulations and ipr d 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in one or both of these income approaches include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows  adjusted for the probability of technical and marketing success  the amount and timing of projected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products  the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows  the estimate of an appropriate market royalty rate  and an assessment of the asset life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset  including consideration of any technical  legal  regulatory  or economic barriers to entry 
the company believes the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions  however  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy and validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date  the company estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  the company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the company consolidated statements of operations 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment  as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
useful life is the period over which the intangible asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the company future cash flows 
the company determines the useful lives of intangible assets based on a number of factors  such as legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  and the effects of obsolescence  anticipated demand  existence or absence of competition  and other economic factors on useful life

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest income earned on its investment of cash on hand and interest expense on borrowings used to finance acquisitions and working capital requirements 
the company enters into certain derivative financial instruments  when available on a cost effective basis  to hedge its underlying economic exposure  related to the management of interest rate risk 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s derivative and hedging activities 
because of the use of certain derivative financial instruments and the significant amount of fixed rate debt  the company believes that a fluctuation in interest rates in the near future will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
these instruments are managed on a consolidated basis to efficiently net exposures and thus take advantage of any natural offsets 
derivative financial instruments are not used for speculative purposes 
gains and losses on hedging transactions are offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
foreign exchange risk the company has operations in the uk  israel  mexico and australia 
these operations transact business in their local currency and foreign currencies  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
a large portion of the sales of the company s israeli operations is in foreign currencies  primarily us dollars and euros  while these operations incur costs in their local currency 
in addition  the company us operations continue to expand its export business  primarily in canada  china and europe and are subject to fluctuations in the respective currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar 
due to sales and cost structures  certain segments experience a negative impact as a result of the changes in exchange rates while other segments experience a positive impact related to foreign currency exchange 
the company estimates an additional ten percent devaluation of the us dollar relative to the other foreign currencies it transacts business in would have decreased operating income of its foreign operating units by approximately million for fiscal this sensitivity analysis has inherent limitations 
the analysis disregards the possibility that rates of multiple foreign currencies will not always move in the same direction relative to the value of the us dollar over time 
in addition  the company enters into certain purchase commitments for materials which  although denominated in us dollars  are linked to foreign currency valuations 
these commitments generally contain a range for which the price of materials may fluctuate over time given the value of a foreign currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of the company s international operations is made using their foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  the company could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if it were to exit the market and liquidate its net investment 
as of june   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments increased shareholders equity by million 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than an operating unit s functional currency 
for fiscal  net transaction losses were million 
the company monitors and strives to manage risk related to foreign currency exchange rates 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s derivative and hedging activities 
the company cannot predict future changes in foreign currency exposure 
unfavorable fluctuations could adversely impact earnings
