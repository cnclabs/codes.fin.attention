item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion highlights significant factors influencing the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the national security group  inc referred to in this document as we  our  us  the company or nsg and its subsidiaries 
we are a smaller reporting company under securities and exchange commission sec regulations and therefore qualify for the scaled disclosure of smaller reporting companies 
in general  the same information is required to be disclosed in the management discussion and analysis by smaller reporting companies except that the discussion need only cover the latest two year period and disclosures relating to contractual obligations are not required 
in accordance with the scaled disclosure requirements  this discussion covers the two year period ended december  the national security group  inc is made up of two segments the life segment and the p c segment 
the company life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in the company property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in this discussion and analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
please refer to our note regarding forward looking statements on pages of this report 
information in this discussion is presented in whole dollars rounded to the nearest thousand 
the national security group operates in the property and casualty and life  accident and supplemental health insurance businesses and markets products primarily through independent agents 
the company operates in ten states with of gross premium revenue generated in the states of alabama and mississippi 
property and casualty insurance is the most significant segment  accounting for of total insurance premium revenue for revenue generated from the life segment accounted for of total insurance premium revenue for national security insurance company nsic is a life  accident and health insurance company founded in and is the oldest subsidiary of the company 
the premium revenue produced in nsic from the traditional life products and accident and health products accounted for and  respectively  of total premium revenue 
all references to nsic in the remainder of this management discussion and analysis will refer to the combined life  accident and health insurance operations and will compose the life segment of the company 
nsic is licensed to underwrite life and accident and health insurance in alabama  florida  georgia  mississippi  south carolina and texas 
omega one insurance company omega is a property and casualty insurance company incorporated in omega is a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire and casualty company nsfc and is the smallest of the 
table of contents insurance subsidiaries  accounting for approximately of consolidated premium revenue 
omega is licensed and underwrites property and casualty insurance in the states of alabama and louisiana 
there is no material product differentiation between those products underwritten by nsfc and omega as both primarily underwrite personal lines of insurance 
national security fire and casualty company nsfc is a property and casualty insurance company and is the largest of the insurance subsidiaries  accounting for over of total premium revenue of the company 
nsfc operates primarily in the personal lines segment of the property and casualty insurance market 
nsfc has been in operation since nsfc is licensed and underwrites property and casualty insurance in the states of alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  mississippi  oklahoma  south carolina and tennessee 
nsfc is licensed  but does not currently underwrite any business  in the states of kentucky and west virginia 
nsfc also underwrites insurance on a non admitted or surplus lines basis in the states of louisiana  missouri and texas 
all of the insurance subsidiaries are alabama domiciled insurance companies  therefore  the alabama department of insurance is the primary insurance regulator 
however  each subsidiary is subject to regulation by the respective insurance regulators of each state in which it is licensed to transact business 
insurance rates charged by each of the insurance subsidiaries are typically reviewed and approved by each insurance department for the respective state to which the rates will apply 
all of our insurance companies have been assigned ratings by am best 
the property and casualty group has been assigned a group rating of b good with a negative outlook 
in addition  am best has assigned an issuer credit rating of bbb with a negative outlook 
nsfc  the largest of the insurance subsidiaries  carries the same am best ratings as the group 
omega carries an am best rating of b good with a stable outlook and an issuer credit rating of bbb with a stable outlook 
the life insurance subsidiary  nsic  has been assigned an upgraded rating of b good from b fair with a stable outlook and an issuer credit ratio upgrade of bbb up from bb with a stable outlook 
all ratings are reviewed at least annually by am best with the latest ratings effective date of november  am best is currently undergoing its annual review process of our ratings 
the two primary segments in which we report insurance operations are the personal lines property and casualty segment nsfc and the life  accident and health insurance segment nsic 
due to the small amount of premium revenue produced by omega and the fact that omega is a wholly owned subsidiary of nsfc underwriting similar lines of business  all references to nsfc in the remainder of this management discussion and analysis will include the insurance operations of both nsfc and omega 
our income is principally derived from net underwriting profits and investment income 
net underwriting profit is principally derived from earned premiums received less claims paid  sales commissions to agents  costs of underwriting and insurance taxes and fees 
investment income includes interest and dividend income and gains and losses on investment holdings 
summary of consolidated results of operations condensed revenue and income information follows year ended december  premium earned investment income realized investment gains other income total revenues net loss income net loss income per share for the year ended december   total revenues were  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
a decline in net premiums earned  primarily in the p c segment  was the main contributing factor to the decrease in total revenue for over partially offsetting the decline in revenue was a  increase in realized investment gains in the current year compared to the same period last year 
the increase in realized capital gains was primarily from the sale of equity securities in the life segment 

table of contents year to date net premiums earned were down in compared to the decrease was composed of a  or decline in total life  accident and health premium revenue and a  or decrease in p c net premiums earned 
primary drivers of the decline in net premiums earned were an increase in catastrophe reinsurance costs and a decline in automobile premium  both in the p c segment 
catastrophe reinsurance cost was up approximately in compared to in addition  we added reinsurance premium protection rpp coverage to our reinsurance coverage during to help reduce capital exposure in the event of a major catastrophe in the p c segment 
the rpp coverage cost increased reinsurance ceded and reduced premium revenue by  furthermore  due to the termination of the automobile program in late  p c segment premium revenue was reduced  in the current year compared to the same period last year 
the company ended with a net loss totaling  compared to a net loss of  in the company ended with a net loss per share of compared to net loss per share of in the primary reasons for the net loss in were an increase of  in litigation settlement and defense costs and an increase in incurred losses from hurricane isaac claims 
during  we settled longstanding litigation related to the sale of the mobile attic  inc this settlement was the primary reason for the significant increase in litigation settlement and defense costs in the current year compared to the same period last year 
the final settlement totaled  and the impact of the settlement and remaining legal fees are reflected in these consolidated financial statements 
additional information related to the settlement can be found below in the litigation settlement and defense costs discussion  liquidity and capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
also contributing to the net loss in were hurricane isaac reported losses and lae which totaled  from  claims 
the claims from this cat event increased the p c segment loss ratio by percentage points 
additional discussion regarding this catastrophe follows in the industry segment data section of the management discussion and analysis 
as a percent of net premiums earned  claims were through december  compared to for the same period last year  a decrease of percentage points 
although claims were down in compared to  both years were negatively impacted by a higher frequency of reported losses due to cat events 
as mentioned in the preceding paragraph  the p c segment was negatively impacted by hurricane isaac in during  the p c segment was impacted by an extremely active spring storm season with april being ranked as the most active tornado month on record 
the largest of these spring storms occurred on april th th  referred to as catastrophe and caused widespread damage from tornado  wind and hail damage throughout the southeastern united states 
this cat event led to  reported claims during totaling   net of reinsurance recoveries 
p c segment incurred losses and lae from the automobile program also contributed to the elevated claims levels in the automobile program was terminated in late due to continued unprofitable underwriting results 
year to date incurred losses and lae were  in compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the decline in current year claims was reserve releases 
the decision to discontinue the automobile programs was made by management in an effort to improve the profitability of p c underwriting results and stabilize earnings 
results of operations for years ended december  and the company ended with net premiums earned totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
premium revenue is generated from our two operating segments p c segment and life segment 
the p c segment accounts for approximately of total premium revenue while our life segment contributes the remaining 
the p c segment operates in personal lines insurance products primarily generating premium revenue from dwelling fire and homeowners coverages 
our life segment produces premium revenue primarily from whole life  accident and critical illness insurance policies 

table of contents the table below provides a summary premium revenue by segment and line of business for the year ended december  and year ended december  percent increase decrease life  accident and health operations traditional life insurance accident and health insurance total life  accident and health property and casualty operations dwelling fire extended coverage homeowners including mobile homeowners ocean marine other liability private passenger auto liability commercial auto liability auto physical damage total property and casualty reinsurance premium ceded total net earned premium revenue a primary reason for the decline in net premium revenue was an increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost in in addition to a increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost related to our cat coverage  we also incurred  related to the cost of adding reinsurance premium protection rpp to our catastrophe reinsurance structure in the rpp coverage reduces our risk from a major catastrophe and helps strengthen our capital position 
in the event of a major catastrophe  the rpp coverage limits the pretax impact on earnings of a modeled year cat event by approximately million 
a year event is defined as an event that has approximately a probability of occurring in a given year 
reinsurance ceded in the prior year was up  due to reinstatement premium related to catastrophe discussed previously 
to offset the increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost in the p c segment  we are implementing rate increases in states and territories most impacted by catastrophe reinsurance cost 
we did experience significant margin compression in due to the combination of the previously mentioned increased cat cost which became effective in january of and delays inherent in the rate approval process 
our cat reinsurance cost held steady in and as rate increases are implemented  we should experience some relief from catastrophe cost related margin compression 
net investment income remained relatively unchanged ending at  compared to  in  a decrease of 
a primary reason for comparable results for investment income was the minimal change in invested assets in the current year compared to the prior year 
the company ended with invested assets of  compared to  in  a or  decrease 
in addition  cash flow from p c segment operations was adversely impacted by claims incurred from hurricane isaac in which reduced operating cash flow available to grow investments 
this outflow  coupled with a challenging interest rate environment  were primary reasons for the lack of growth in investment income in the current year compared to the same period last year 
net realized investment gains totaled  in compared to  in  an increase of  the  increase in realized investment gains in compared to was primarily in the life segment which ended the current year with an increase of  while the p c segment increase totaled  the primary reason for the increase was a greater amount of selling activity during the current year compared to the same period last year 
a primary focus during the current year was to moderately reduce the equity portfolio in the life segment in order to increase the allocation to fixed income 
these efforts were made to improve duration matching of liabilities and strengthen regulatory cash flow testing results 
the realization of capital gains in the investment portfolio is influenced by both market conditions and liquidity requirements of the insurance subsidiaries and therefore 
table of contents can vary significantly from year to year 
other activities  such as tax planning strategies  may also lead to significant variation in realized capital gains from year to year 
other income was  for the period ended december  compared to  for the same period last year  a  decrease 
other income consists primarily of billing  payment and policy fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies in the p c segment as well as other  primarily non recurring  miscellaneous income 
the primary reason for the decrease during compared to was a decline in fee income related to the discontinuance of our automobile program in the p c segment 
policyholder benefits paid claims decreased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
claims as a percentage of net premiums earned totaled for compared to in the primary reason for the  decrease was lower claims activity in the p c segment primarily related to less storm activity during compared to coupled with decreased claims in the automobile line of business in compared to however  while comparatively better  claims were still elevated in the current year due to losses and lae reported from hurricane isaac 
the p c segment is affected by storm systems classified as catastrophes by property claims service pcs when a single storm system or other natural disaster causes in excess of million in industry losses 
the losses and loss adjustment expenses lae incurred in the p c segment from claims associated with storm systems classified as catastrophic referred to as cat events hereafter  totaled  in compared to   net of reinsurance in the current year claims were incurred from nine separate cat events and accounted for of total claims during the year compared to of claims on a net basis from eighteen cat events during the prior year 
the largest cat event during was hurricane issac from which we incurred  policyholder claims totaling  hurricane issac claims accounted for of all incurred losses and incurred lae related to cat events during the p c segment maintains catastrophe reinsurance to reduce risk associated with losses from cat events 
the reinsurance is structured with a  retention deductible from a single cat event with coinsurance retained on the first two layers of coverage 
any claim activity exceeding the first two layers is reinsured up to  in ultimate incurred losses and lae 
because the claims from hurricane issac did not exceed our deductible for  they were not reinsured 
a cat event on april th th  catastrophe was the primary source of the overall losses and lae incurred during the reported losses and lae cat totaled  the reinsurance deductible for was  because the p c segment losses and lae reported from catastrophe exceeded the reinsurancedeductible  the p c segment recovered  from reinsurers during the prior year 
the p c segment retained  of the reported losses and lae from catastrophe during amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dac and commissions totaled  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of  the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in premium revenue in the p c segment 
general and administrative expenses decreased  ending at  compared to  for the same period last year 
although general and administrative expenses were down  management continues to focus on this area as we seek ways to maximize efficiency and reduce costs by streamlining processes and cross training employees across both insurance segments of the company 
taxes  licenses and fees were comparable at  in compared to  for the same period last year 
as a percent of premium revenue  taxes  license and fees for the year ended december  and were and  respectively 
premium taxes were moderately higher due to shifts in p c gross written premium with declines in surplus lines states in which we incur no premium taxes and increases in gross written premium in states in which we typically incur higher premium taxes  principally alabama and georgia 
litigation settlement and defense costs were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  on june   the company settled longstanding litigation related to the company sale of mobile attic  inc which was the primary reason for the increase in the current year compared to the prior year 
the company believed that the damages claimed in the litigation were excessive in amount and that a substantial portion of the claimed damages was unrelated to the company involvement in the mobile attic transaction 
however  with no guidance on damages  in the event of an excessive verdict we would have faced 
table of contents significant liquidity constraints in supporting a potentially long  expensive and arduous appeal process 
therefore  after careful consideration  management made a decision to reach a settlement agreement 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will pay a total of million to the plaintiff 
in order to manage the liquidity constraints  the settlement will be in the form of an interest bearing note with amounts to be paid over nine years with the ability to defer payments in years in which the company p c subsidiaries incur substantial catastrophe losses thus allowing capital management flexibility in the p c subsidiaries 
under the terms of the agreement  the annual debt service on the note cannot be less than the dividends paid to our shareholders in the last twelve months 
the company made an initial installment payment of  in september the remaining principal will be repaid in nine annual installments of  accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable with each installment of principal based on the prime rate published in the wall street journal plus 
additional information related to the settlement can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section of the management discussion and analysis as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense for the year ended december  was up  from the prior year at  compared to  in interest expense related to litigation settlement discussed above in the holding company was the primary reason for the increase in compared to the company had an income tax benefit totaling  in compared to income tax benefit totaling  in primary components of the income tax benefit for the year ended december  and included deferred tax benefits associated with the litigation settlement of  and  respectively and deferred tax benefits associated with nol carryforward of  and  respectively

the litigation settlement and million in pretax hurricane isaac losses mentioned above were the primary reasons for the net loss in the claims incurred from cat events and adverse underwriting results in the automobile program were the primary contributing factors to the net loss in stockholder equity and book value per share stockholders equity for the year ended december  was  compared to  at december   a decrease of  or 
the change in stockholders equity is composed of dividends paid to shareholders of  and a net loss of  as well as accumulated other comprehensive income  primarily decreases in accumulated unrealized capital gains  totaling  and unrealized losses on interest rate swap totaling  year end book value per share  defined as stockholders equity divided by common shares outstanding of  was at december  compared to at december  industry segment data premium revenues for the national security group two operating segments life segment  property and casualty segment are summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance property and casualty insurance the property and casualty segment composed of total premium revenue in compared to in the p c segment is primarily composed of dwelling fire and homeowners lines of business 
the life segment composed of premium revenue in compared to in with revenue produced primarily from life  accident and supplemental health insurance products 
the following discussion outlines more specific information with regard to the individual operating segments of the company along with non insurance related information primarily administration expenses associated with the insurance holding company 

table of contents life and accident and health insurance operations our life segment is the smaller of our insurance segments contributing of total insurance premium revenue in and in premium revenues and operating income for the life segment for the year ended december  and are summarized below amounts in thousands revenue net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains other income benefits and expenses policyholder benefits paid or provided amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs commissions general and administrative expenses insurance taxes  licenses and fees interest expense income before income taxes year ended december  compared to year ended december  nsic premium accounted for of total consolidated premium revenue for premium revenue in nsic was  at december  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
the  decrease in gross premium revenue was primarily due to the  or decline in ordinary business related to the independent agent distribution method 
the home service distribution method also contributed to the overall decline in premium revenue ending down compared to the same period last year 
nsic has faced challenges in growing life insurance revenue over the past two years due to new competitors in the market paying independent agent commission rates that we believe to be unprofitable long term and would contribute to short term surplus strain if we matched those commission rates 
we intend to increase focus on niche areas and products in in order to reverse the declining revenue trend 
as mentioned previously  nsic operates using two primary methods of distribution home service employee agents and independent agents 
while the company has used the traditional home service distribution method since its founding in  the independent agent distribution method has become the largest source of renewal business and new business production over the past decade 
for  the home service and independent agent distribution methods accounted for and  respectively of nsic premium revenue 
net investment income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the same period last year 
investment income in nsic is generated from securities held in our investment portfolio as well as mortgage and policy loan interest 
the  increase was primarily related to a increase in invested assets in compared to nsic ended with net realized investment gains totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the  increase in net realized investment gains was increased selling activity in compared to a primary focus during the current year was to moderately reduce the equity portfolio in order to increase the allocation to fixed income 
these efforts were made to improve duration matching of liabilities and strengthen regulatory cash flow testing results 
net realized capital gains were also impacted during the current year by recognized other than temporary impairment losses on one security totaling  however  we had recoveries from previously recognized other than temporary impairments totaling  the life segment recognized other than temporary impairment losses totaling  during with recoveries of previously recognized other than temporary impairments of  
table of contents policyholder claims were  through december  compared to  through december   an increase of  the primary reason for higher claims in the current year compared to the prior year was a increase in death and maturity benefit incurred losses 
deferred policy acquisition cost amortization and commission expenses increased  for the year ended december  at  compared to  for the same period last year  an increase of 
the increase in expense was primarily due to a reduction in cost capitalized in the current year to a change in accounting rules related to limitations on capitalization of costs associated with unsuccessful sales in life and a h insurance products 
general and administrative expenses were  in compared to  in as a percent of earned premium  general and administrative expenses were virtually unchanged ending december  and at and  respectively 
although general and administrative expenses decreased in compared to  as a percent of premium revenue  they were slightly higher 
historically  general and administrative expenses in our life segment have run higher than industry averages due to the small size of the subsidiary 
management continues to review processes to find ways to maximize efficiency and reduce costs and is currently looking into employee cross training opportunities between insurance segments of the company to help achieve this goal 
however  due to the size of our life insurance subsidiary  reduction of general expenses will continue to be a challenge 
for the year ended december  and  insurance taxes  licenses and fees were  and  respectively 
as a percent of earned premium  insurance taxes  licenses and fees were in compared to in the primary reasons for the  decrease were the decline in premium revenue combined with an increase in fees in the prior year associated with a periodic examination which concluded during the first half of nsic had interest expense of  in compared to  in as a percent of earned premium  interest expense was at december  compared to at december  for the year ended december   the life segment had year to date pretax net income of  compared to a pre tax net loss of  for the same period last year 
although the results were better in the current year compared to the prior year  the primary reason for the improvement was the  increase in realized capital gains 
as mentioned previously  we will continue to face challenges due to the small size of our life insurance subsidiary due to scale  however  reduction of expenses will remain a primary focus area with the goal of improved operational results from the life segment 

table of contents property casualty operations property and casualty operations constitute our largest segment composing and of our total premium revenue in and  respectively

the primary reasons for the decrease in premium revenue in compared to were the discontinuance of the automobile program in addition to increases in reinsurance cost and the addition of rpp coverage 
production of premium revenue in the p c segment is primarily driven by our dwelling fire and homeowner lines of business 
the following table provides premiums earned by line of business line of business premium earned of npe premium earned of npe increase decrease over dwelling fire allied lines homeowners ocean marine private passenger automobile commercial automobile reinsurance ceded reinstatement premium net premium earned p c segment premium revenue was down in compared to one primary reason for the decrease in premium revenue was the termination of the private passenger non standard and commercial automobile programs 
due to unprofitable underwriting results for multiple years  the decision was made by management to discontinue the automobile program in late the termination of the automobile programs led to a  or decrease 
table of contents in automobile premium revenue in the current year compared to the prior year 
no auto policies were in force at december  another contributing factor to the decline in p c premium revenue was a slight decrease related to our property programs 
for the year ended december   premium revenue from our property programs totaled  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
a re underwriting project in the first half of led to a net decline in homeowners policies in force contributing to the decline in homeowners premium but should help improve future underwriting profits 
an additional factor contributing to the decline in current year premium revenue was an increase in ceded premium  up in compared to the company maintains catastrophe reinsurance coverage to mitigate loss exposure from catastrophic events 
the premium related to this coverage increased approximately in with our deductible increasing to million from million in the prior year 
in addition to the increase in catastrophe reinsurance cost  we also incurred  related to reinsurance premium protection rpp in the decision to add the rpp coverage was made by management in an effort to reduce earnings volatility in the p c segment 
the rpp coverage reduces our risk from a major catastrophe and helps strengthen our capital position 
under the catastrophe reinsurance program for  the company retains the first  in losses from each event 
reinsurance coverage is maintained in four layers as follows layer reinsurers limits of liability first layer of  in excess of  second layer of  in excess of  third layer of  in excess of  fourth layer of  in excess of  additional details regarding the structure of the current year agreement can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a catastrophe event in late april  which exceeded our single event retention  triggered additional ceded premium payments reinstatement premium in order to reinstate coverage under our catastrophe reinsurance agreement 
this catastrophe reinstatement premium was  in compared to  in net investment income totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in investment income in the p c segment was primarily attributable to a decline in invested assets in compared to for the year ended december  and  p c segment invested assets were  and  respectively  a decrease of 
partially offsetting the decline was an increase in investment income related to the company owned life insurance coli value which increased  in the current year compared to the same period last year 
the p c segment ended with realized capital gains totaling  compared to  for the same period last year 
the increase in realized capital gains was primarily associated with an increase in selling activity during the current year compared to the the prior year 
realized capital gains from the sale of three securities during accounted for of total realized capital gains for the current year 
the realization of capital gains in the investment portfolio is influenced by both market conditions and liquidity requirements and therefore can vary significantly from year to year 
other activities  such as tax planning strategies  may also lead to significant variation in realized capital gains from year to year 
the p c segment was not impacted by the write down of other than temporary impairments in or other income was  in compared to  for the same period last year  a  or decrease 
other income consists primarily of fees related to the issuance of our property and automobile insurance policies as well as miscellaneous income 
as a percent of net earned premium  other income was in compared to in due to the termination of our automobile programs  billing  payment and policy fees declined  which triggered the overall reduction in other income for the current year 
claims were  in compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of  or 
the primary reason for the decrease was a reduction in losses from tornado  wind and hail related cat 
table of contents events as well as claims associated with our automobile line of business 
however  partially offsetting this decrease was adverse claim activity related to hurricane isaac which predominantly impacted louisiana and mississippi in late august the gross losses and adjustment expenses reported in the p c segment from claims associated with cat events during totaled  these claims were incurred from nine separate cat events and accounted for of p c segment claims during the current year 
in comparison  the p c segment had gross losses and adjustment expenses reported from seventeen cat events during totaling  or of p c segment claims during the prior year 
of the nine cat events during  the most notable was hurricane issac which made landfall late in august reported losses and lae from this cat event totaled  and accounted for of total claims related to cat events 
the company had  claims reported from hurricane isaac with an average severity per claim of  because the losses and lae from hurricane isaac did not exceed the catastrophe reinsurance retention of million  the company did not have any ceded losses or lae related to this cat event 
a cat event on april th th  catastrophe was the primary source of the overall losses and lae incurred during the reported losses and lae from cat totaled  the reinsurance deductible for was  because the p c segment losses and lae reported from catastrophe exceeded the reinsurance deductible  the p c segment recovered  from reinsurers during the prior year 
the p c segment retained  of the reported losses and lae from catastrophe during after reinsurance 
in our catastrophe reinsurance model results  which we utilize to establish reinsurance coverage limits  this tornado event exceeded a one in year return period  which means that this event had a probability of occurrence in the models of less than four tenths of one percentage point in any given year 
we routinely evaluate our claims frequency and severity statistics in order to better understand the nature of our risks and aid in the loss reserve liability evaluation process 
claims frequency is a measure of the number of claims incurred during a measurement period regardless of amount 
claims severity is a measure of the average dollar amount of claims during a measurement period 
the p c companies incurred  claims from nine cat events in compared to  claims from seventeen cat events in the average severity per claim related to the cat events was  compared to  per claim  net of reinsurance recoveries in the average severity per claim related to the tornado outbreak on april th th   catastrophe  was  and contributed significantly to skewing s average severity upward 
the personal lines automobile program ended with incurred losses and incurred lae of  compared to  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the decline in current year claims was reserve releases 
the automobile programs were cumulatively unprofitable and produced year over year underwriting losses prior to program termination in because of the continued lack of underwriting profits and significant claim activity associated with this program  the decision was made to terminate the program during the fourth quarter of the automobile policies are six month coverage periods  therefore  all policies have now expired 
the discontinuance of the automobile program  while contributing to a further decline in premium revenue  is expected to positively impact overall underwriting results provided we do not experience any further adverse development on reported claims  many of which are liability coverage claims which tend to take longer to settle 
the p c segment had fewer losses and lae from fire related claims reported in compared to for  the p c segment had reported fire losses and lae of  compared to  for the same period last year  a decrease of 
the p c segment had claims reported from fire losses and lae in compared to fire claims reported during with an average severity per claim of  for both years 
the p c segment continued to be involved in litigation pertaining to claims from hurricane katrina which impacted our coverage areas in louisiana and mississippi in august the cumulative claims associated with hurricane katrina exceeded the  million upper limit of the reinsurance agreement in effect during for the year ended december   claims exceeding the upper limits of our reinsurance related to hurricane katrina totaled  nine claims remain open from hurricane katrina and based on presently available information  management believes reserves are adequate to cover the ultimate liability 
deferred policy acquisition costs totaled  in compared to  in deferred policy acquisition costs were comparable at of premium revenue for  down percentage points compared to 
table of contents of premium revenue for the same period last year 
deferred policy acquisition costs consist of amortization of previously capitalized distribution costs which are primarily commissions 
commission expense for was  of premium revenue compared to  of premium revenue for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the  or decrease in commission expense during compared to was a decline in contingent commissions payments to our general agents 
general and administrative expenses totaled  in compared to  in  a decrease 
the primary reason for the  decline in general and administrative expenses was a reduction in costs associated with the discontinued automobile programs along with continued company wide cost reduction efforts 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees were  in compared to  for the same period last year 
insurance taxes  licenses and fees were up slightly at of premium revenue in compared to in although premium revenue in the p c segment was down in compared to  there was an up tick in premium revenue in a couple of states in which we write business 
the increases led to higher premium taxes in the current year compared to the prior year for these states and was the primary reason for the overall increase in insurance taxes  licenses and fees 
the p c segment ended with pre tax net income of  compared to a pre tax net loss of  for the same period last year 
the primary reason for the net income in the current year was the  decrease in claims in compared to however  partially offsetting the decrease in claims was  in reported losses and lae related to hurricane isaac in in addition  decreases in deferred acquisition costs and commissions of  and  respectively  coupled with an increase of  in realized investment gains all contributed to the increase in net income in compared to the combination of declining revenue and increased claims led to the negative results in the prior year 
property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer underwriting performance is the combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premium revenue 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premium revenue 
the results of these ratios for the past two years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe  however  prohibitive catastrophe reinsurance costs associated with maintaining lower deductibles prevent us from further mitigating hurricane risks 
during  the p c segment experienced a decrease of percentage points in the combined ratio compared to the primary reason for the decrease was a  decline in incurred losses from catastrophe related tornado  wind and hail related claims

table of contents non insurance operations revenue net investment income net realized investment gains benefits and expenses general and administrative expenses litigation settlement and defense costs interest expense loss before income taxes the non insurance operations of the company consist of our parent company  the national security group  inc the national security group has no material sources of revenue and relies almost entirely on dividends from subsidiaries to pay expenses 
dividends from subsidiaries are subject to insurance department approval and are subject to statutory restrictions 
subsidiary dividends are eliminated upon consolidation of the subsidiaries in the audited financial statements included herein 
general and administrative expenses totaled  compared to  for the same period last year  a increase 
the expenses of nsg are primarily associated with the public listing of our stock  taxes and fees  and directors fees 
the most significant item impacting the increase in general expenses were increases in interest costs related to deferred compensation and bank charges related to the line of credit obtained during the year 
litigation settlement and defense costs incurred by nsg for the year ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the  increase is directly related to the settlement of the mobile attic litigation matter as discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements with additional commentary included in liquidity and capital resources 
on june   the company and the bagley family revocable trust bagley trust reached a settlement agreement to dispose of the mobile attic related action 
under terms of the settlement  the company agreed to pay bagley trust  the company paid  to the bagley trust on september   with the balance payable in nine equal annual installments beginning in november with a final payment in the settlement agreement contains an option for the company to defer payments in years in which its p c subsidiaries incur substantial catastrophe losses  providing some flexibility in regards to capital management 
the settlement agreement also requires annual debt service payments to equal or exceed any payment of dividends to shareholders in the preceding twelve months 
interest cost remains a significant expense for nsg 
nsg borrowings include  in long term debt and  in short term notes payable and current portion of long term debt 
long term debt is composed of subordinated debentures  an installment note and a secured line of credit 
the  in subordinated debentures consists of two trust preferred security offerings 
the first being  issued in december and the second being  issued in june the primary use for these proceeds was to add capital to the property and casualty subsidiaries following the hurricanes of and a  promissory note was executed to finance the mobile attic related settlement obligation 
as of december   a total of   included in short term debt was outstanding with principal payments due in equal installments of  payable each november beginning in the company also has a  secured line of credit obtained in september as of december    was drawn on this line 
the line of credit is secured by timber property

investments the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
the types of assets in which the company can invest are influenced by various state insurance laws which prescribe qualified investment assets 
while working within the parameters of these prescribed regulatory requirements 
table of contents as well as liquidity and capital needs  the company considers investment quality  investment return  asset liability matching and composition of the investment portfolio when choosing investments 
at december   the company holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the company utilizes the ratings of various nationally recognized statistical rating organizations when classifying fixed maturity investments by quality rating 
the most significant shift in quality ratings occurring in was the downgrade of us government debt by s p from their highest rating of aaa to aa 
moody and fitch continued to carry us government debt at their highest rating throughout due to the split ratings of the major rating agencies  us government and agency debt is shown in the table below in the category of aaa aa 
the following is a breakdown of the company fixed maturity investments by quality rating of total bond portfolio s p or equivalent ratings aaa aa aa aa a a a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade due to the downgrade of united states government bonds  aaa and aa are presented consolidated for comparability 
most of the securities within this combined category are united states government and agency bonds  which are now rated aa 
as depicted in the table above  the company investment allocation shifted slightly to lower quality investment grade securities 
this shift occurred primarily in the life insurance subsidiary and resulted from an increased allocation in corporate bonds 
most of the shift was composed of purchases of intermediate term corporate bonds 
while credit quality dropped moderately  the corporate bonds provided increased yield and improved cash flow predictability  better matching duration and crediting rate of insurance liabilities in what continues to be a challenging interest rate environment 
the company closely monitors its investment holdings and believes the slight reduction in credit quality will be offset by higher yields versus lower risk alternatives 
the company reviews investment allocations throughout the year and makes adjustments within the portfolio as needed

management has evaluated each security in a significant unrealized loss position 
for the year ended december   the company realized  in other than temporary impairments 
most of the remaining unrealized losses in the fixed income portfolio  for which no impairment has been realized  are interest rate driven as opposed to credit quality driven and management believes no ultimate loss will be realized 
in evaluating whether or not the equity loss positions were other than temporary impairments  management evaluated financial information on each company and where available reviewed analyst reports from at least two independent sources 
based on a review of the available financial information  the prospect for future earnings of each company and consideration of the company s intent and ability to hold the securities until market values recovered  it was determined that the remaining securities in an accumulated loss position in the portfolio were temporary impairments 
there were no recoveries on securities for a portion of which other than temporary impairments were realized during during  recoveries on securities for a portion of which other than temporary impairments were realized totaled the amortized cost and aggregate fair value of debt securities at december   by contractual maturity  are as follows dollars in thousands

as discussed previously the shift in the portfolio will allow for greater yields and provide a moderate increase in duration 
mortgage backed security investments the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include residential mortgage backed securities rmbs of million and million at amortized value at december  and  respectively 
we own no commercial mortgage backed securities 
we also have no material direct exposure in sub prime mortgage loans in our private label rmbs portfolio 

table of contents the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than were expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
in order to minimize risk associated with prepayments on collateralized mortgage obligations  the company typically invests primarily in more predictable planned amortization class pac structures of cmo and typically avoids investment in cmo priced at significant premiums above par value 
as for the composition of the rmbs portfolio  agency mortgage backed securities compose and of the rmbs portfolio at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the rmbs portfolio is composed of private label mortgage backed securities 
these securities consist primarily of conventional and year loans with an average borrower fico score at origination of we own no mortgage backed securities with direct exposure to subprime loans and less than of the rmbs portfolio is composed of loans subject to rate resets 
three securities in the private label mortgage backed security portfolio are rated below investment grade and compose less than of total invested assets 
investment portfolio income investment returns with respect to the investment portfolio for the years ended december  and follows year ended december  net investment income average current yield on investments total return on investments net realized gains on investments before taxes change in accumulated net unrealized gains before income taxes the company was able to maintain current yield on investments primarily by shifting invested dollars into investment grade securities with slightly lower credit quality 
as discussed previously  the shift occurred primarily within the life insurance subsidiary in order to increase yield and extend duration in order to better match life company liabilities 
repurchase agreements the company subsidiaries maintain repurchase agreements under which the policy requires minimum of the fair value of the securities purchased to be maintained as collateral 
cash collateral received is invested in short term investments 
the repurchase investments are limited to government securities that are highly liquid 
the company does not have any reverse repurchase agreements 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the property and casualty insurance subsidiaries are of various terms  and therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various effective maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liabilities of the life insurance subsidiary are typically of a longer duration  and therefore  a higher percentage of securities in the life insurance subsidiary are invested for periods exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
all operations and virtually all investments are maintained by the insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investments  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 

table of contents virtually all invested assets of the company are held in the insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   the maturity schedule for all bonds and notes held by the company  stated at amortized cost  was as follows dollars in thousands maturity available for sale held to maturity total percentage of total maturity in less than year maturity in years maturity in years maturity after years it should be noted that the above table represents maturities based on stated maturity 
due to call and prepayment features inherent in some debt securities  actual repayment  or effective maturities  will differ from stated maturities 
the company routinely evaluates the impact of changing interest rates on the projected maturities of bonds in the portfolio and actively manages the portfolio in order to minimize the impact of interest rate risk 
currently  for every basis point change in interest rates  the company will incur a change in market price of the fixed income portfolio of approximately

the company also has  in short term notes payable and current portion of long term debt 
this debt includes a  operating line of credit to allow flexibility with respect to cash management at the holding company level 
the outstanding balance on the line  at december   was  we had  available at december   under the operating credit line 
also included in short term debt is  the current portion due on a long term notes payable 
the company  primarily through its insurance subsidiaries  had  in cash and cash equivalents at december   compared to  at december  cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled  compared to cash used in the same period last year totaling  net cash provided by investing activities totaled  for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of  for the same period last year 
during the prior year  investment sales were necessary to increase liquidity in order to pay storm claims in the p c segment during the second quarter as a result of losses from catastrophe 
table of contents the following table reflects the anticipated cash flows associated with our short and long term contractual obligations and commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years through years through more than years notes payable debt obligations interest on debt obligations property and casualty claim reserves future life insurance obligations long term debt  consisting of two separate issues of trust preferred securities  a line of credit and the long term portion of an installment note is assumed to be settled at contractual maturity 
interest on long term debt is calculated using the interest rates in effect at december  for each issue 
interest on long term debt is accrued and settled quarterly on the trust preferred securities  monthly on the line of credit and annually on the installment note 
therefore  the timing and amount of interest payments may vary from the calculated value included in the table above 
these calculations do not take into account any potential prepayments 
for additional information regarding long term debt and interest on long term debt  please see note  notes payable and long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated payout of property and casualty claim reserves  which includes loss and loss adjustment expenses  are based upon historical payout patterns 
both the timing and amount of these payments may vary from the payment indicated 
future life insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments and surrender benefits on policies inforce at december  these estimated payments are computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
in contrast to this table  the majority of nsic s obligations is recorded on the balance sheet at the current account values and do not incorporate an expectation of future market growth  interest crediting or future deposits 
therefore  the estimated future life insurance obligations presented in this table significantly exceed the liabilities recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
due to the significance of the assumptions used  the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
management believes that current assets  future premiums and investment income will be sufficient to fund all future life insurance obligations 
included in long term debt held by the company is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed on december  the proceeds from the debentures were used to make a  capital infusion in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty with the remainder to be held for general corporate purposes 
the subordinated debentures mature december  it is anticipated that principal payments will not be made until the expiration of the fixed rate period on the debt in also included in long term debt is the issuance of  in subordinated debentures completed june  the proceeds from the debentures were used to fund general corporate expenses  thereby reducing the amount of dividends to the group paid by the p c subsidiary national security fire casualty in and  thereby continuing to restore capital in the p c subsidiary national security fire and casualty to pre hurricane levels 
the second issue matures june  and may be redeemed following the fifth anniversary of issuance 
also included in long term debt held by the company is a line of credit in the amount of  obtained in september the line of credit is secured by timber property and had  drawn at december  in july  the company executed an installment note in the amount of  to finance the settlement obligation related to the mobile attic litigation 
as of december   a total of  was outstanding   included in notes payable 
in estimating the time interval for payment of property and casualty claim reserves  the company utilized historical payment patterns 
by the nature of the insurance contracts under which these liabilities exist  there can be no certainty that actual payments will fall in the periods indicated above 
however  management believes that current liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to pay these obligations as they come due 
also  due to the relatively short tail nature of the majority of the company property and casualty claim liabilities  management can conclude with a reasonable level of confidence that historical patterns indicate that approximately of claim liabilities at the end of a given year are settled within the following two year period 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments  which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
the company liquidity requirements are primarily met by funds provided from operations of the insurance subsidiaries 
the company receives funds from its subsidiaries through payments for federal income taxes and reimbursement of expenses incurred at the corporate level for the subsidiaries 
these funds are used to pay stockholder dividends  interest on debt  corporate administrative expenses  federal income taxes  and for funding investments in the subsidiaries 
the company maintains minimal liquidity in order to maximize liquidity within the insurance subsidiaries in order to support ongoing insurance operations 
the company has no separate source of revenue other than 
table of contents dividends and fees from the insurance subsidiaries 
also  dividends from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and  therefore  are limited depending on capital levels and earnings of the subsidiaries 
our p c segment  incurred  in losses from hurricane isaac during the third quarter triggering current year underwriting losses in the p c segment 
these underwriting losses coupled with the transfer of timber property to the holding company contributed to a decline in statutory capital levels in the p c segment 
these reduced capital levels  while adequate to operate our existing business  have reduced the subsidiary ability to pay dividends upstream to the holding company in the near term 
dividends paid from the insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulatory restrictions and prior approval of the alabama department of insurance 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k  the amount that the national security group insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company during is limited to  in the life insurance subsidiary and  in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
dividends are limited to the greater of net income operating income for life subsidiary or of statutory capital and regulators consider dividends paid within the preceding twelve months when calculating the available dividend capacity 
therefore  all of the above referenced dividend capacity will not be available for consideration of payment until dividends paid in the preceding twelve months have been considered on a rolling basis 
the company also has to continuously evaluate other factors such as subsidiary operating performance  subsidiary capital requirements and potential impact by rating agencies in making decisions on how much capital can be allocated for dividends to nsg 
these factors are considered along with the goal of growing year over year statutory surplus in the subsidiaries and these considerations along with recent adverse impacts on regulatory surplus will likely lead to dividend payments to nsg substantially below the above referenced regulatory maximums 
in july of  nsfc issued an extraordinary dividend of real estate to the holding company in order to secure a bank line of credit 
the payment of this extraordinary dividend will limit nsfc ability to pay further dividends to the parent company until august of the payment of any subsidiary dividend requires prior notice to the regulatory authorities who may disallow the dividend if  in their judgment  payment of the dividend would have an adverse effect on the surplus of the subsidiary 
the company s subsidiaries require cash in order to fund policy acquisition costs  claims  other policy benefits  interest expense  general expenses  and dividends to the company 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities  calls  and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash for both subsidiaries 
a significant portion of the company s investment portfolio  which is held by the insurance subsidiaries  consists of readily marketable securities  which can be sold for cash 
due to the erosion in capital levels in the p c subsidiaries  we have made changes in order to reduce capital surplus strain in the p c subsidiaries and help protect capital levels from substantial further erosion resulting from a major catastrophic event 
these changes include a combination of reduction in underwriting leverage and an increase in catastrophe reinsurance protection 
a summary of each change follows in late  we discontinued both our private passenger and commercial automobile programs 
these two programs accounted for approximately of net written premium in  down from nearly in but had produced significant underwriting losses over the last five years 
due to a combination of reduced capital levels and a view that it would take some time to achieve underwriting profitability  we made the decision to discontinue the program in order to reduce surplus strain and underwriting leverage in the p c subsidiaries 
the final in force policies in this program expired in mid we have incurred substantial losses from catastrophe events over the past seven years 
these events have driven up catastrophe reinsurance cost and forced our catastrophe reinsurance deductible up from million in to million in our renewal 
as our cat retention has increased  we have attempted to achieve higher margins in our insurance rate structure in order to compensate for the additional risk of the higher catastrophe reinsurance retention but with limited success due to regulatory constraints primarily because this additional retention was not a hard dollar cost in our rate structure 
so  since we were limited in our ability to increase margins for this additional retained risk and due to the capital erosion incurred in  in the second quarter of  we placed additional reinsurance cover in the form of reinsurance premium protection rpp 
the rpp cover will serve to reduce our risk from a major catastrophe and strengthen our capital position 
the effect of adding this additional rpp cover is to reduce our modeled year event net cost net of reinsurance recoveries from approximately million pretax to an estimated million pretax 
a year event is defined as an event that has approximately a probability of occurring in a given year 
this 
table of contents additional cover added million to our cat reinsurance cost in and due to time lags in the rate adjustment process compressed margins in but will help protect capital from major events going forward 
as disclosed in note to these consolidated financial statements regarding contingencies  the company was involved in litigation related to its divestiture of mobile attic  inc the company insurance subsidiaries were not involved in this litigation  and the company has funded all costs associated with defending this action 
the defense cost placed a strain on our liquidity in the holding company leading up to the date of the jury trial which was set for june of as was disclosed in our previous filings  the company believed that the damages claimed in the litigation were excessive in amount and that a substantial portion of the claimed damages was unrelated to the company involvement in the mobile attic transaction 
the company believed that the damages should be limited to a diminished value of the purchaser original investment in mobile attic resulting from the claimed breach of warranty in the stock purchase agreement 
the company had filed motions for summary judgment requesting a court ruling as to how damages should be measured as a matter of law 
as was disclosed in our first quarter form q  on april   the court heard oral arguments on the motion for summary judgment and took the matter under advisement 
several events unfolded in june of  leading up to trial that caused the company to reexamine positions with regard to the litigation 
first  shortly before trial  mobile attic former auditors and our co defendant in the matter reached an out of court settlement with the plaintiff and therefore would not be defending their actions  which were expected to help support the defense of claims 
second  one of the remaining co defendants with whom the company was jointly liable for claims under the stock purchase agreement was the former president of mobile attic who was sentenced to federal prison for bank fraud in and is currently serving a five year sentence in a west virginia federal penitentiary 
third  the court had not made a definitive ruling prior to commencement of the trial on how damages would be calculated 
fourth  with the lack of clarity on potential damages  it appeared that damage amounts were potentially going to be left in the hands of a jury in a matter that involved very complex legal and accounting issues with the potential to include damages for other actions involving our co defendants in which we had no involvement 
fifth  while we believe it is possible that a jury would have returned a verdict for less than the amount for which we settled  we believe it would have been difficult to negotiate post trial settlement terms that would allow us to support our insurance operations and maintain our rating agency ratings 
finally  with no guidance on damages  in the event of an excessive verdict we would have faced significant liquidity constraints in supporting a potentially long  expensive and arduous appeal process 
immediately before the trial  settlement discussions with the plaintiff approached the amount of the financial benefit that nsg had received from the purchaser in the mobile attic transaction 
after careful consideration of the aforementioned factors  management made a decision to reach a settlement agreement just as the trial was about to commence 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company will pay a total of million to the plaintiff 
in order to manage the liquidity constraints  the settlement will be in the form of an interest bearing note with amounts to be paid over nine years with the ability to defer payments in years in which the company p c subsidiaries incur substantial catastrophe losses thus allowing capital management flexibility in the p c subsidiaries 
under the terms of the agreement  the annual debt service on the note cannot be less than the dividends paid to our shareholders in the last twelve months 
the company made an initial payment of  in september the remaining principal will be repaid in nine annual installments of  accrued and unpaid interest shall be payable with each installment of principal based on the prime rate published in the wall street journal plus 
cash to fund the litigation settlement will come from three primary sources 
first  the company owns  acres of timber property with a carrying value of approximately million and an estimated fair market value of million 
as previously discussed  this property was used as collateral to obtain a  operating line of credit through a regional bank to aide in restoring short term liquidity and allow flexibility in managing holding company liquidity 
ultimately  the company will seek to sell the property or use the proceeds from timber sales on the property to retire the debt 
second  the holding company has significant deferred tax assets associated with a net operating loss nol carryforward generated by a combination of this settlement and defense costs incurred over the last two years 
this nol carryforward will generate tax benefits that will offset a portion of future tax liabilities of the p c insurance subsidiaries in our consolidated tax returns 
it is expected that this nol carryforward will generate approximately million in tax benefits over the term of the settlement 
finally  dividends and management fees paid by the insurance subsidiaries will provide an additional source of proceeds to pay this obligation 
although not a preferred source of flexibility  the company can also defer interest payments on the trust preferred securities to provide additional operating cash flow 
in the event that the company elects to defer interest payments  shareholder dividends will be suspended until interest payments are current 

table of contents except as discussed above and in note to these consolidated financial statements  the company is unaware of any known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
the company maintains an unsecured operating line of credit  with a  limit  to allow flexibility with respect to cash management at the holding company level 
the outstanding balance at december  was  the company obtained a  secured line of credit in september to provide additional operating flexibility to the holding company 
the outstanding balance at december  was we have taken and continue to take corrective action to improve our profitability and capital position 
however  due to the adverse effects of six major hurricanes in the last eight years  the financial market meltdown in  continued historically low interest rates  an unprecedented tornado outbreak in april of and the recently settled litigation  we have experienced significant reduction in equity capital 
while we are beginning to see improvement and have put some major obstacles behind us  we are in a position where we have to preserve capital in the near term in order to put our company in the best position to be successful moving forward 
in order to improve our capital position  we will continue to monitor our dividend policy on a quarterly basis and could take action including the suspension of dividends should operating conditions warrant such action 
due to various factors discussed herein  we must remain flexible in our dividend policy until we achieve more consistent profitability and capital growth 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc regulatory event less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of to at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and  respectively

application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based upon the development and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
accounting policies may be based on including but not limited to gaap authoritative literature  statutory authoritative literature  regulations and industry standards 
the company financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to select and apply our accounting policies 
it is management opinion that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in regards to the application of our accounting policies and their effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurance deferred policy acquisition costs income taxes fair values of financial instruments claim liabilities recognition of revenue contingencies recently issued accounting standards reinsurance risk management involves ceding risks to reinsurers for policies underwritten based on contractual agreements 
the reinsurance purchased helps provide protection by individual loss or catastrophic event when claims exceed specified amounts 
although the reinsurance protects our company in the event a loss penetrates into a particular reinsurance agreement  ultimate responsibility for claim settlement rests with our company if any reinsurer defaults on payments due 
we record an asset for reinsurance recoverable on the financials for amounts due from reinsurers and monitor the balances due by reinsurer to ensure the asset is ultimately going to be collectible 
if we discover an amount due may not be received  we remove the balance and charge it to an allowance for doubtful accounts or charge it off to expense based on the information available at the time 
when a claim is made under a policy we have reinsured  we initially pay the full amount owed to the policyholder or claimant 
subsequently  we initiate the process to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of applicable reinsurance treaties 
reinsurance is maintained by the life and accident and health segment for losses that exceed  for any one insured 
nsfc and omega generally reinsure with third parties any liability in excess of  on any single policy 
during  the property and casualty segment maintained a catastrophe contract  which covered losses related to a catastrophic event with multiple policyholders affected 
in the event a catastrophe exceeded the million retention stated in the contract  reinsurers would reimburse the company co pay of gross losses and loss adjustment expenses paid up to million layer one and layer two of the contract 
if losses exceeded million  the contract allowed for reimbursement of losses and loss adjustment expenses up to million 
any losses above the million upper limit were the responsibility of our company 
the contract in place during also allowed one reinstatement for coverage under the contract for a second catastrophic event if needed 
the contract provided protection which exceeded a year near term event as depicted in catastrophe modeling results 
the near term catastrophe modeling results reflect a predicted increase in storm activity given the current weather pattern and various factors projected to impact our weather patterns in the near term 
at december   the estimated reinsurance recoverable recorded was  compared to  for the same period last year 
the company does not anticipate any issues with collection of the recorded amount 
in  catastrophe reinsurance premiums totaled  ceded compared to  in catastrophe reinsurance premiums are based on a premium calculation applying the agreed upon rate to the earned premium of the covered lines of business 
the increase in ceded premium in is attributable to a increase in the rate applied 
in addition to catastrophe reinsurance  the company placed reinstatement premium protection rpp reinsurance during rpp premiums totaled  
table of contents the reinsurance related amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management interpretation of the related reinsurance treaty 
areas in which judgment has been used regarding said estimates include assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed 
there is a possibility that the actual amounts recovered from reinsurers could be materially less than the estimates recorded 
this possibility could result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
reinsurers may dispute claims under reinsurance treaties  such as the calculated amount of reinsurance recoverable 
management does not anticipate any issues with recoverability of reinsurance balances based on current evaluations of collectability 
for more information regarding reinsurance  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs dac are those costs incurred in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
dac is primarily comprised of commissions  premium taxes  and underwriting costs associated with issuing new policies 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these costs are not expensed in their entirety at policy inception  rather  they are recorded as an asset and amortized over the lives of the policies 
a reduction in dac is recognized if the sum of the expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and projected investment income 
management reviews dac calculations throughout the year to establish and assess their recoverability 
changes in management assumptions  estimates or judgment with respect to calculating dac could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
changes in loss ratios  projected investment income  premium rates or overall expense levels could negatively impact the recoverability of dac 
at december  or  the company recorded  and  respectively  as an asset for dac in the financial statements 
we do not foresee any issues related to recoverability of these capitalized costs 
for more information regarding deferred policy acquisition costs  see note to our financial statements 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or are settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period the new rate is enacted 
at december   there is no evidence to suggest to management that any deferred tax asset is unrealizable 
for more information regarding deferred income taxes  see note to our financial statements 
the company evaluates all tax positions taken on its us federal income tax return 
no material uncertainties exist for any tax positions taken by the company 
fair values of financial instruments investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices when available 
quoted prices are available for most investment debt and equity securities included in the financial statements 
further discussion of fair value methodology is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically  the carrying values of an individual investment may become temporarily impaired because of time value  volatility  credit quality and existing market conditions 
management evaluates investments to determine whether the impairment is other than temporary 
evaluation criteria include credit quality of security  severity of decrease between cost and market value  length of time of the impairment and likelihood that the impairment will reverse in the near future 
this evaluation requires significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
if the impairment is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to the current fair value and a realized loss is recorded on the income statement 
we have very limited exposure to less liquid and difficult to value investments such as collateralized debt obligations 
claim liabilities property and casualty loss reserves are maintained to cover the estimated unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported incurred claims 
loss reserves are an estimation based on actuarial projection techniques common in the insurance industry 
reserves are management expectations of what the settlement and administration of claims will cost 
management estimated reserves are based on historical settlement patterns  estimated salvage and subrogation  and an appraisal of the related facts and circumstances 
management 
table of contents reserve estimates are reviewed by consulting actuaries to determine their adequacy and reasonableness 
the reserve analysis performed by management is reviewed by the actuaries during the third quarter each year with a final comprehensive review and actuarial sign off performed at year end 
at december  and  the recorded liability for loss and loss adjustment expense was  and  respectively  a  decrease 
the primary reason for the decline was a reduction in losses from tornado  wind and hail related cat events as well as claims associated with the automobile line of business 
we believe the estimate of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses to be sufficient based on currently available information and a review of our historical reserving practices 
for more information regarding loss and loss adjustment expense  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recognition of revenue life insurance premiums are recognized as revenues when due 
property and casualty insurance premiums include direct writings plus reinsurance assumed less reinsurance ceded and are recognized on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies

prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and is reported as an asset

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under smaller reporting company rules we are not required to disclose information required under item a 
however  in order to provide information to our investors  we have elected to provide information related to market risk 
the company primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company equity portfolio is equity price risk 
since the company assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities and changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
our portfolio has historically been highly correlated to the s p with regard to market risk 
based on an evaluation of the historical risk measure of our portfolio relative to the s p  if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company common stock would decrease by approximately  certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
notes and in the consolidated financial statements present additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities and are incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of losing principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on capital for a sustained period of time  and low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market 
as for shifts in investment allocations  the company has moderately increased allocations to corporate and tax free bonds 
the improved yield spreads on corporate bonds has made this segment more attractive and the risk of investing in corporate bonds versus government bonds is more appropriately priced in our opinion 
we have also increased 
table of contents our allocation to tax free securities to further enhance after tax returns given our improved earnings performance over the last two years
