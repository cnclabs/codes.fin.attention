our field application engineers  or faes  and design engineers are located near many of our customers around the world  enabling us to support our customers in each stage of their product development cycle  from early stages of production design through volume manufacturing and future growth 
by collaborating with our customers  we have opportunities to develop high value added  customized products for them that leverage our existing technologies 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the fiscal years ended november   october  and october   respectively 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant research and development expenditures in order to maintain our competitive position with a continuous flow of innovative and sustainable product platforms 
as of november   we had approximately  employees dedicated to research and development at multiple locations around the world 

table of contents customers  sales  marketing and distribution historically  a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our net revenue 
sales to distributors accounted for of our net revenue for fiscal year in fiscal year  direct sales to foxconn technology group companies  or foxconn  accounted for of our net revenue 
our top ten direct customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we believe our aggregate sales to apple  inc and cisco systems  inc  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  for fiscal year we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we sell our products through our direct sales force and a network of distributors globally 
certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries  such as contract manufacturers  and both often require timely delivery of our products to multiple locations around the world 
our direct sales force is focused on supporting our large oem customers 
additionally  our extensive network of faes enhances our customer reach and our visibility into new product opportunities 
we have strategically developed distributor relationships to serve thousands of customers around the world 
based on net revenue  our main global distributors are avnet  inc  and arrow electronics  inc  complemented by a number of specialty regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges 
as of november   our sales and marketing organization consisted of approximately employees  many of whom have responsibility for emerging accounts  for large  global accounts  or for our distributors 
our sales force has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer s organization 
as part of our global reach  we have a number of sales offices located in various countries  with a significant presence in asia  which is a key center of the worldwide electronics supply chain 
many of our customers design products in north america or europe that are then manufactured in asia 
we maintain dedicated regional customer support call centers  where we address customer issues and handle logistics and other order fulfillment requirements 
we believe we are well positioned to support our customers throughout the design  technology transfer and manufacturing stages across all geographies 
operations we use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including ase korea inc  and inari technology sdn bhd 
a portion of our front end wafer manufacturing operations is outsourced to external foundries  including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company ltd  or tsmc  and win semiconductors corp 
we maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  while we outsource standard cmos processes 
examples of internally fabricated semiconductors include fbar filters for wireless communications and vcsel based and indium phosphide based lasers for fiber optic communications 
the majority of our internal iii v semiconductor wafer fabrication is done in the united states and singapore 
as of november   approximately  manufacturing employees were devoted to our internal fabrication operations as well as management of outsourced activities 
most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process  typically at one particular foundry  either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer  and in some instances  we may only qualify one contract manufacturer to manufacture certain of our products 
for selected customers  we maintain finished goods inventory near or at customer manufacturing sites to support their just in time production 
materials and suppliers our manufacturing operations employ a wide variety of semiconductors  electromechanical components and assemblies and raw materials 
we purchase materials from hundreds of suppliers on a global basis 
these supply relationships are generally conducted on a purchase order basis 
while we have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining the materials used in the conduct of our business and we believe that no single supplier is material  some of the parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for re design or qualification 
our long term relationships with our suppliers allow us to proactively manage our technology development and product discontinuance plans  and to monitor our suppliers financial health 
some suppliers may nonetheless extend their lead times  limit supplies  increase prices or cease to produce necessary parts for our products 
if these are unique components  we may not be able to find a substitute quickly  or at all 
to address the potential disruption in our supply chain  we may use a number of techniques  including qualifying more than one source of supply  redesigning products for alternative components and incremental  or in some cases lifetime  purchases of affected parts for supply buffer 

table of contents competition the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
the competitive landscape is changing as a result of a trend toward consolidation within the industry  as some of our competitors have merged with or been acquired by other competitors while others have begun collaborating with each other 
we expect this consolidation trend to continue 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter the market 
additionally  our ability to compete effectively depends on a number of factors  including quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
in the wireless communications target market  we provide rf amplifiers  filters modules and ambient light and proximity sensors for mobile phones 
our primary competitors for this target market are ams ag formerly taos inc  murata manufacturing co  ltd  rf micro devices  inc  skyworks solutions  inc  and triquint semiconductor  inc 
we compete based on our expertise in amplifier design  fbar technology and module integration 
we also compete against a number of smaller  niche wireless players based on our proprietary design expertise  broad product portfolio  proprietary material processes and integration expertise 
in the wired infrastructure target market  we provide fiber optic transceivers and serdes asics for high speed data communications and server applications 
our primary competitors for this target market are finisar corporation  international business machines corp 
microelectronics division  lsi corporation  st microelectronics nv and sumitomo corporation

in the industrial other target market  we provide fiber optic transceivers for communication networks  leds for displays  motion control encoders and subsystems and optocouplers for factory automation and motor controls 
our primary competitors for this target market are analog devices  inc  cree  inc  hamamatsu photonics kk  heidenhain corporation  renesas electronics corporation and toshiba corporation 
we compete based on our design expertise  broad product portfolio  reputation for quality products and large customer base 
intellectual property our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through security measures to protect our trade secrets 
we believe our current product expertise  key engineering talent and intellectual property portfolio provide us with a strong platform from which to develop application specific products in key target markets 
as of november   we had approximately  us and foreign patents and approximately us and foreign pending patent applications 
our research and development efforts are presently resulting in approximately new patent applications per year relating to a wide range of asic  isolation  encoder  led  rf and optoelectronic components and associated applications 
the expiration dates of our patents range from to  with a small number of patents expiring in the near future  none of which are expected to be material to our intellectual property portfolio 
we are not substantially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents 
we focus our patent application program to a greater extent on those inventions and improvements that we believe are likely to be incorporated into our products  as contrasted with more basic research 
however  we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or the extent to which the examination process could require us to narrow our claims 
we have also entered into a variety of intellectual property licensing and cross licensing arrangements 
a meaningful portion of our intellectual property is the subject of cross licenses to other companies that have been granted by agilent technologies  inc  or if originally derived from hewlett packard company  by hewlett packard company 
in addition  we license third party technologies that are incorporated into some elements of our design activities  products and manufacturing processes 
historically  licenses of the third party technologies used by us have been available to us on acceptable terms 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights 
many of our customer agreements require us to indemnify our customers for third party intellectual property infringement claims 
this has in the past required  and may in the future require  that we defend those claims  and might also require that we pay damages in the case of 
table of contents adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us 
with respect to any intellectual property rights claims against us or our customers or distributors  we may be required to cease manufacture of the infringing product  pay damages  expend resources to develop non infringing technology  seek a license which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  or relinquish patents or other intellectual property rights 
employees as of november   we had approximately  employees worldwide 
approximately  were dedicated to research and development   to manufacturing  to sales and marketing and to general and administrative functions 
by geography  approximately of our employees are located in asia  in north america  and in europe 
the substantial majority of our employees are not party to a collective bargaining agreement 
however in asia  approximately of our employees in singapore  none of whom are in management or supervisory positions  are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with united workers of electronic and electrical industries  which expires on june   and some of our employees in japan are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
in europe  all of our employees in italy are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
in italy we are also subject to national collective agreements between unions and employer associations 
such italian national collective agreements are compulsory for both the employees and the employer 
in addition  in germany we are subject to collective agreements with the works councils at our sites  which apply to german employees other than managing directors and managers with similar authority 
in mexico  approximately of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement  none of whom are in management or supervisory positions 
we believe we have a good working relationship with our employees and we have never experienced an interruption of business as a result of labor disputes 
environmental and other regulation our research and development and manufacturing operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international  federal  state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment 
these regulations include limitations on discharge of pollutants to air  water  and soil  remediation requirements  product chemical content limitations  manufacturing chemical use and handling restrictions  pollution control requirements  waste minimization considerations  and treatment  transport  storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
we are also subject to regulation by the united states occupational safety and health administration and similar health and safety laws in other jurisdictions 
we believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and worker health and safety laws  however  the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws to our business will not require us to incur significant expenditures 
we are also regulated under a number of international  federal  state and local laws regarding recycling  product packaging and product content requirements  including legislation enacted in the european union and china  among a growing number of jurisdictions  which have placed greater restrictions on the use of lead  among other chemicals  in electronic products  which affects materials composition and semiconductor packaging 
these laws are becoming more stringent and may in the future cause us to incur significant expenditures 
we are also subject to new sec rules for companies that use certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
these rules require companies to diligence  disclose and report on whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices  including our products 
in addition  we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products 
backlog our sales are generally made pursuant to short term purchase orders 
these purchase orders are made without deposits and may be  and often are  rescheduled  canceled or modified on relatively short notice  and in most cases without substantial penalty 
therefore  we believe that purchase orders or backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future sales 

table of contents seasonality we have historically been affected by seasonal trends in the semiconductor and related industries 
our net revenue in the second half of the fiscal year has typically been higher than our net revenue in the first half of the fiscal year due to seasonality in our wireless communications target market 
this target market historically tended to experience seasonality due to the calendar year end holiday selling seasons 
from time to time  our key customers  particularly in our wireless communications target market  place large orders causing our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly 
we expect that these fluctuations will continue and that they may be exaggerated by the launches of  and seasonal variations in sales of  consumer products such as mobile handsets  as well as changes in the overall economic environment 
these fluctuations combined with other factors have increasingly overshadowed these seasonal effects in recent periods

table of contents item a 
risk factors our business  operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those described below  that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and the trading price of our ordinary shares 
the following important factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the sec  press releases  communications with investors and oral statements 
risks related to our business adverse global economic conditions could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
adverse global economic conditions have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in the semiconductor industry generally  as well as in our target markets  which adversely affected our business and results of operations 
in recent periods  market and business conditions in general have been adversely affected by investor and customer concerns about the global economic outlook  including concerns about economic recovery in the united states and the level of growth in china 
in addition  us and global economic conditions could be exacerbated by the negative effects on economic growth resulting from the concerns about  and the effects of  the us fiscal and monetary policies  any related spending cuts and tax increases and the possibility of further downgrades to the us government credit rating 
macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue  gross margin and expenses 
sustained uncertainty about  or worsening of  current global economic conditions will likely cause our customers and consumers to reduce or delay spending  leading to reduced demand for our products  could lead to the insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays and customers and intensify pricing pressures 
any or all of these factors could negatively affect our business  financial condition and result of operations 
we operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry  which is subject to significant downturns 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change and price erosion  evolving technical standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles for semiconductors and for the end products in which they are used and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
from time to time  these and other factors  together with changes in general economic conditions  cause significant upturns and downturns in the industry in general and in our business in particular 
periods of industry downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end user products  high inventory levels and periods of inventory adjustment  under utilization of manufacturing capacity  changes in revenue mix and accelerated erosion of average selling prices  resulting in an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable 
if we cannot offset recessionary periods or periods of reduced growth that may occur in the industry  or in our target markets in particular  through increased market share or otherwise  our business could be adversely affected  net revenues may decline and our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
in addition  in any future economic downturn we may be unable to reduce our costs quickly enough to maintain our operating profitability 
the majority of our sales come from a small number of customers and the demands or loss of one or more of our significant customers may adversely affect our business 
we are dependent on a reasonably small number of direct customers  oems and distributors for a majority of our business  revenue and results of operations 
during fiscal year  foxconn technology group companies together accounted for of our net revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during fiscal year  foxconn technology group companies together accounted for of our net revenue  and our top customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we also believe that aggregate sales of our products to certain of our customers exceeds the amount of our direct sales to them 
for example  we believe our aggregate sales to apple inc and cisco systems  inc  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  respectively  for fiscal year we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
this customer concentration increases the risk of quarterly fluctuations in our revenues and operating results 
in addition  our top customers purchasing power has  in some cases  given them the ability to make greater demands on us with regard to pricing and contractual terms in general 
we expect this trend to continue  which may adversely affect our gross margins on certain products 
in addition  we expect this will result in our results of operations becoming increasingly sensitive to deterioration in the financial condition of  or other adverse developments related to  one or more of our significant customers 
although we believe that our relationships with our major customers are good  we generally do not have long term contracts with any of them  which is typical of our industry 
although our customers often provide us with medium to long term 
table of contents product roadmaps and related indications of their product needs and purchases on a periodic basis  they generally purchase our products on a weekly or daily basis and the relationship  as well as particular orders  can be terminated at any time 
in order to ensure availability of our products for some of our largest customers  we start manufacturing our products in advance of receiving purchase orders  based on forecasts provided by these customers 
these forecasts are not binding purchase commitments and  as a result  we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales 
since actual demand for our products may not match these forecasts  manufacturing on this basis subjects us to increased risks of high inventory carrying costs  product obsolescence and increased operating costs 
in addition  the loss of any of our major direct or indirect customers  or any substantial reduction in sales to any of these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are increasingly dependent on the mobile handset market  which is volatile and is characterized by short product life cycles  fluctuations in demand  seasonality and increasingly high customer concentration any of which could negatively impact our business or results of operations 
a substantial and increasing portion of our revenue is generated from sales of products for use in mobile handsets  particularly our fbar products 
during the fiscal years and  revenue from our wireless communications target market accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
the mobile handset market is characterized by intense competition among an increasingly concentrated group of oems  rapidly evolving technology  including the shift to lte and lte advanced standards  and changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  aggressive price competition  short product life cycles  and continually evolving mobile handset specifications 
if we  our customers or mobile handset oems are unable to manage product transitions  our business and results of operations could be negatively affected 
our success in this market is dependent on the continued competitiveness of our fbar products  and on the broad commercial acceptance of the mobile handsets into which our products are incorporated  as well as increasing the amount of our products in successive generations of those handsets 
if the mobile handsets into which our products are designed do not achieve significant customer acceptance  our revenue will be adversely affected 
similarly  even though we may achieve design wins for a particular handset  we may not be designed into the next generation of a particular handset or new model of handset  which could result in a sharp decrease in our revenues 
in the mobile handset market  demand has typically been stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year  but the timing of new handset launches  which also drive demand  is often unpredictable 
if mobile handset oems inaccurately forecast consumer demand  this may lead to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers 
we have experienced both sharp increases and decreases in orders within the same quarter  often with limited advance notice  and we expect such increases and decreases to occur in the future 
in addition  although the worldwide wireless handset market is large  growth trends and other variables are often uncertain and difficult to predict 
since the wireless handset market is a consumer driven market  changes in the economy that affect consumer demand can adversely affect our business and operating results 
our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations 
our revenues and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may occur on a quarterly and annual basis and are due to a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  among others the timing of launches by our customers of new products  such as cell phones  in which our products are included and changes in end user demand for the products manufactured and sold by our customers  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  fluctuations in the levels of component inventories held by our customers  customer concentration and the gain or loss of significant customers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  changes in our product mix or customer mix and their effect on our gross margin  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products and technologies on a timely basis  the timing and extent of our non product revenue  such as product development revenues and royalty and other payments from intellectual property sales and licensing arrangements  our ability to successfully and timely integrate  and realize the benefits of  our acquisition of cyoptics  inc  or cyoptics  and any other significant acquisitions we may make  new product announcements and introductions by us or our competitors  
table of contents timing and amount of research and development and related new product expenditures  and the timing of receipt of any research and development grant monies  seasonality or cyclical fluctuations in our markets  currency fluctuations  utilization of our internal manufacturing facilities  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  significant warranty claims  including those not covered by our suppliers or our insurers  availability and cost of raw materials from our suppliers  intellectual property disputes and associated litigation expenses  loss of key personnel or the shortage of available skilled workers  the effects of competitive pricing pressures  including decreases in average selling prices of our products  the timing of acquisitions of  or making and exiting investments in  other entities  businesses or technologies  and changes in our tax incentive arrangements or structure  which may adversely affect our net tax expense in any quarter in which such an event occurs 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast  and these  as well as other factors  could materially adversely affect our quarterly or annual operating results 
in addition  a significant amount of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature due to our significant sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead costs 
any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful or a reliable indicator of our future performance 
if our operating results in one or more future quarters fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our ordinary shares may occur 
winning business is subject to lengthy  competitive selection processes that require us to incur significant expense 
even if we begin a product design  a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to generate no revenues from a product and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes  known as design wins  to develop semiconductors for use in our customers products 
these selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to incur significant design and development expenditures and dedicate scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity 
we may not win the competitive selection process and may never generate any revenue despite incurring significant design and development expenditures 
these risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products  and the end products into which our products are incorporated  often have very short life cycles 
for example  cell phone manufacturers regularly introduce new or upgraded handsets  often every to months and sometimes more frequently  and will bid out the components for each new model  and often every upgrade of a particular model 
failure to obtain a design win sometimes prevents us from offering an entire generation of a product 
this can result in lost revenues and could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes 
winning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer 
we may experience delays in generating revenue from our products as a result of the lengthy development cycle typically required  or may not realize as much revenue as we had anticipated 
in addition  a delay or cancellation of a customer plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results  as we may have incurred significant expense in the design process and generated little or no revenue 
customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or may fail to successfully market and sell their products  which could reduce demand for our products and materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
finally  the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win  or multiple design wins occurring at or around the same time  may strain our resources and those of our contract manufacturers 
in such event we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional  unanticipated costs and expenses  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents competition in our industry could prevent us from growing our revenue and from raising prices to offset increases in costs 
the global semiconductor market is highly competitive 
we compete in different target markets to various degrees on the basis of  among other things  quality  technical performance  price  product features  product system compatibility  system level design capability  engineering expertise  responsiveness to customers  new product innovation  product availability  delivery timing and reliability  and customer sales and technical support 
current and prospective customers for our products evaluate our capabilities against the merits of our direct competitors 
some of our competitors are well established  have a more extensive product portfolio  have substantially greater market share and manufacturing  financial  research and development and marketing resources to pursue development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing and distribution of their products 
in addition  many of our competitors have longer independent operating histories  greater presence in key markets  more comprehensive patent protection and greater name recognition 
we compete with integrated device manufacturers  or idms  and fabless semiconductor companies as well as the internal resources of large  integrated oems 
our competitors range from large  international companies offering a wide range of semiconductor products to smaller companies specializing in narrow markets 
we expect competition in the markets in which we participate to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings 
in addition  companies not currently in direct competition with us may introduce competing products in the future 
because our products are often building block semiconductors providing functions that in some cases can be integrated into more complex ics  we also face competition from manufacturers of ics  as well as customers that develop their own ic products 
our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control  including industry and general economic trends 
during past periods of downturns in our industry  competition in the markets in which we operate intensified as manufacturers of semiconductors reduced prices in order to combat production overcapacity and high inventory levels 
the actions of our competitors  particularly in the area of pricing  can have a substantial adverse impact on our revenues  and potentially on revenues in specific industry end markets 
in periods where the semiconductor industry experiences significant declines  manufacturers in financial difficulties or in bankruptcy may implement pricing structures designed to ensure short term market share and near term survival  rather than securing long term viability 
in addition  many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us with which to withstand adverse economic or market conditions and any associated pricing actions of other market participants in the future 
our target markets may not perform as expected and our business and operating results could be harmed in such event 
visibility into our target markets is limited and industry and target market growth rates may not be as forecasted 
any decline in our customers markets would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products 
in such an environment  pricing pressures could intensify and  if we were unable to respond quickly  could significantly reduce our gross margins and reduce our revenue 
if target market growth rates are not as expected  particularly in areas such as lte handsets and datacenters  to the extent that we incur expenditures on process and product development that does not align with projected market requirements  this could also have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we may pursue acquisitions  dispositions  investments and joint ventures  which could affect our results of operations 
we may make acquisitions of  and investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services and technologies  augment our market coverage  or enhance our technological capabilities 
we may also enter into strategic alliances or joint ventures to achieve these goals 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition  investment  alliance  or joint venture opportunities  that we will be able to consummate any such transactions or relationships on terms and conditions acceptable to us  or that such transactions or relationships will be successful 
in addition  our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any acquisition that we make may be inaccurate and we may not realize the expected financial or strategic benefits of any such acquisition 
from time to time  we may also divest portions of our business that are no longer strategically important or exit minority investments  which could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations for the period in which such events occur 
these transactions or any other acquisitions or dispositions involve risks and uncertainties 
for example  the integration of acquired businesses may not be successful and could result in disruption to other parts of our business 
in addition  any such integration may require that we incur significant restructuring charges  including as a result of streamlining  or divesting non core portions of  acquired businesses 
to integrate acquired businesses  we must implement our management information systems  operating systems and internal controls  and assimilate and manage the personnel of the acquired operations 
the difficulties of these integrations may be further complicated by such factors as the size of the business or entity acquired  geographic distances  lack of experience operating in the geographic market or industry sector of the acquired business  delays and challenges associated with integrating the business with our existing businesses  diversion of management attention from daily operations of the business  potential loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business  the potential for deficiencies in internal controls at the acquired or combined business  performance problems with the acquired business technology  difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience  exposure to unanticipated 
table of contents liabilities of the acquired business  insufficient revenues to offset increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and our potential inability to achieve the growth prospects and synergies expected from any such acquisition 
even when an acquired business has already developed and marketed products  there can be no assurance that product enhancements will be made in a timely fashion or that all pre acquisition due diligence will have identified all material issues that might arise with respect to such acquired business 
any acquisition may also cause us to assume liabilities and ongoing lawsuits  acquire goodwill and non amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing and potential impairment charges  incur amortization expense related to certain intangible assets  increase our expenses and working capital requirements  and subject us to litigation  which would reduce our return on invested capital 
in addition  if the businesses or products lines that we acquire have a different pricing or cost structure than we do  such acquisitions may adversely affect our profitability and reduce our overall margin 
failure to manage and successfully integrate the acquisitions we make or to improve margins of the acquired businesses and products could materially harm our business  operating results and margins 
any future acquisitions may require significant additional debt or equity financing  which  in the case of debt financing  would increase our leverage and potentially affect our credit ratings and  in the case of equity or equity linked financing  would be dilutive to our existing shareholders 
any downgrades in our credit ratings associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow by resulting in more restrictive borrowing terms 
as a result of the foregoing  we also may not be able to complete acquisitions or other strategic transactions in the future to the same extent as in the past  or at all 
these and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition  and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
all of the above may apply to our pending acquisition of lsi corporation  or lsi  which will be our largest acquisition to date  by a significant margin 
the acquisition of cyoptics and the integration of its business  operations and employees with our own involve risks and the failure to integrate successfully in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results 
our ability to integrate significant acquisitions is unproven  and any failure to successfully integrate the business  operations and employees of cyoptics  which we acquired on june   or to otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  could harm our result of operations 
our ability to realize these benefits will depend  in part  on the timely integration and consolidation of organizations  operations  facilities  procedures  policies and technologies  and the harmonization of differences in the business cultures between the two companies and their personnel 
implementation and integration of the cyoptics business will be complex and time consuming  will involve additional expense and could disrupt our business and divert management attention from ongoing business concerns 
the challenges involved in integrating cyoptics include combining and rationalizing our respective product offerings  preserving customer  supplier and other important relationships of both cyoptics and avago  improving gross margin including by improving fabrication facility  or fab  utilization rates and maintaining or improving average selling prices of cyoptics products  coordinating and integrating operations in mexico  a country in which avago has not previously operated  integrating financial forecasting and controls  procedures and reporting cycles  combining and integrating it systems  and integrating employees and related hr systems and benefits  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees 
the benefits we expect to realize from the acquisition of cyoptics are  necessarily  based on projections and assumptions about the combined businesses of avago and cyoptics and assume  among other things  the successful integration of cyoptics into our business and operations 
we may not successfully integrate cyoptics and our operations in a timely manner  or at all 
if we do not realize the anticipated benefits of this transaction  our growth strategy and future profitability could be affected 
these risks may also apply to our pending acquisition of lsi 
in addition  our future effective tax rate is likely to increase as a result of the acquisition of cyoptics 
the majority of cyoptics revenue is generated in the united states  which has a higher statutory tax rate than many other jurisdictions in which we operate  and such revenues will not receive the benefits of the tax incentive arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and malaysia 
similarly  the acquisition will significantly increase the amount of our goodwill and other intangible assets  which could adversely affect our future results of operations 

table of contents dependence on contract manufacturing and outsourcing other portions of our supply chain may adversely affect our ability to bring products to market  damage our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations 
we operate a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model that principally utilizes third party foundry and module assembly and test capabilities 
as a result  we are highly reliant on third party foundry wafer fabrication capacity  including single sourcing for many components or products 
most of our products are designed to be manufactured in a specific process  typically at one particular foundry  either our own or with a particular contract manufacturer 
we also use third party contract manufacturers for a significant majority of our assembly and test operations  including ase korea inc  and inari technology sdn bhd 
the ability and willingness of our contract manufacturers to perform is largely outside of our control 
if one or more of our contract manufacturers or other outsourced providers fails to perform its obligations in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels  our ability to bring products to market and to timely deliver products to our customers  and our reputation could suffer 
suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies  increase prices or discontinue parts due to capacity constraints  changes to manufacturing processes or other factors 
some parts are not readily available from alternate suppliers due to their unique design or the length of time necessary for design work 
if one of our suppliers  particularly a single source supplier  ceases to  or is unable to  manufacture such a component  or changes its manufacturing process  or if supply is otherwise constrained  we may need to transition the manufacture of that product to another foundry or contract manufacturer or source alternative parts  which may be difficult  expensive and take an extended period of time 
we may also be forced to make a significant lifetime purchase of the affected product  in order to enable us to meet our customer demand  or to re engineer a product 
significant lifetime purchases of such discontinued components could significantly increase our inventory and other expenses  such as insurance costs  and expose us to additional risks  such as the loss of  or damage to  products which may not subsequently be available to us from an alternative source 
such supply issues may also cause us to fail to timely meet customer demand 
this could result in the payment of significant damages by us to our customers  and our net revenue could decline 
in such events  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we review our supply chain on an ongoing basis and may seek to qualify second source manufacturers and suppliers for some components and products 
qualifying such second sources may be a lengthy and potentially costly process 
to the extent we rely on third party manufacturing relationships  we face the following risks inability of our manufacturers to develop manufacturing methods appropriate for our products  manufacturers lack of sufficient capacity  or their unwillingness to devote adequate capacity  to produce our products and unanticipated changes to their manufacturing processes  inaccuracies in the forecasts of our product needs from our manufacturers  product and manufacturing costs that are higher than anticipated  reduced control over product reliability and delivery schedules  more complicated supply chains  and time  expense and uncertainty in identifying and qualifying additional or replacement manufacturers 
much of our outsourcing takes place in developing countries  and as a result may additionally be subject to geopolitical uncertainty 
see our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
a prolonged disruption of our manufacturing facilities or other significant operations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although we operate using a primarily outsourced manufacturing business model  we also rely on the manufacturing facilities we own  in particular our gallium arsenide  or gaas  fabs in fort collins  colorado and singapore  and our inp fab in breinigsville  pennsylvania and inp back end assembly facility in matamoros  mexico  acquired as part of the cyoptics transaction 
we maintain our internal fabrication facilities for products utilizing our innovative materials and processes  to protect our intellectual property  to develop the technology for manufacturing and to ensure supply of certain components 
we are currently expanding our fort collins facility to support anticipated growth in sales of our proprietary products  particularly for our wireless target market  and to leverage our fixed costs 
unanticipated delays in the construction of this expansion  or the failure of suppliers to timely deliver tools and other equipment needed to commence manufacturing in the expanded facility  could result in significant additional costs  and could result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand for the products we plan to manufacture at the expanded facility  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  a prolonged disruption or material malfunction of  interruption in  or the loss of operations at  one or more of our production facilities  especially our fort collins  singapore  breinigsville and matamoros facilities  or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities  would limit our capacity to meet customer demands and delay new product development until a replacement facility and equipment  if 
table of contents necessary  were found 
the replacement of any of our manufacturing facilities could take an extended amount of time and significant expenditures on our part before manufacturing operations could restart 
our us headquarters are located in san jose  california and the lease on our facility there expires in november if we are unable to renew this lease on satisfactory terms  we would be required to locate suitable replacement premises  with the goal of ensuring a smooth transition between facilities on or prior to the expiration of our current lease 
we may not be able to timely find suitable replacement premises or acceptable terms  or at all and relocating our us corporate headquarters could require us to incur significant expenses and may cause disruptions to our operations 
the potential delays and significant costs resulting from such steps could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also dependent on various information technology systems  including  but not limited to  networks  applications  and outsourced services 
we continually enhance and implement new systems and processes throughout our global operations 
failure of these systems to operate effectively  could disrupt our operations and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  and results of operations by harming our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and production facilities  fulfill customer orders  and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
if we or our contract manufacturers suffer loss or significant damage to our factories  facilities or distribution system due to catastrophe  our operations could be seriously harmed 
our factories  facilities and distribution system  and those of our contract manufacturers  are subject to risk of catastrophic loss due to fire  flood  earthquake or other natural or man made disasters 
the majority of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturers are located in the pacific rim region  a region with above average seismic and severe weather activity 
in addition  our research and development personnel are concentrated in a few locations  primarily malaysia  singapore  south korea  fort collins  colorado  san jose  california  and breinigsville  pennsylvania  with the expertise of the personnel at each such location tending to be focused on one or two specific areas 
any catastrophic natural disaster in those regions or catastrophic loss or significant damage to any of our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers in those regions would likely disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
such events could also result in significant expenses to repair or replace our affected facilities  and in some instances could significantly curtail our research and development efforts in a particular product area or target market 
we generally do not have any long term supply contracts with our contract manufacturers or materials suppliers and may not be able to obtain the products or raw materials required for our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we either obtain the products we need for our business from third party contract manufacturers or we obtain the materials we need for our products from suppliers  some of which are our single source suppliers for these materials 
we purchase a significant portion of our semiconductor materials and finished goods from a few suppliers and contract manufacturers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six suppliers 
for fiscal year  we purchased of the materials for our manufacturing processes from six suppliers 
substantially all of our purchases are on a purchase order basis  and we have not generally entered into long term contracts with our contract manufacturers or suppliers 
in the event that these purchase orders or relationships with suppliers are terminated  we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials at reasonable prices  the quality of the material deteriorates  we fail to satisfy our customers requirements or we are not able to pass on higher materials or energy costs to our customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
our manufacturing processes rely on many materials  including silicon and gaas and inp wafers  copper lead frames  precious metals  mold compound  ceramic packages and various chemicals and gases 
from time to time  suppliers may extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to commodity price increases  capacity constraints or other factors 
although we believe that our current supplies of materials are adequate  shortages could occur in various essential materials due to interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry 

table of contents failure to adjust our supply chain volume due to changing market or other conditions or failure to accurately estimate our customers demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
we make significant decisions  including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept  production schedules  levels of reliance on contract manufacturing and outsourcing  personnel needs and other resource requirements  based on our estimates of customer requirements 
the short term nature of commitments by many of our customers and the possibility of rapid changes in demand for their products reduces our ability to accurately estimate future customer requirements 
our results of operations could be harmed if we are unable to adjust our supply chain volume to address market fluctuations  including those caused by the seasonal or cyclical nature of the markets in which we operate  or by other unanticipated events such as natural disasters 
in addition  the sale of our products is dependent  to a large degree  on customers whose industries are subject to seasonal or cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
for example  the smartphone market is particularly volatile and is subject to seasonality related to the holiday selling season  making demand difficult to anticipate 
severe supply chain disruptions  such as those caused by large scale natural disasters  can adversely affect our  and our customers  ability to source materials and components needed to manufacture products 
in such event  even if we are able to promptly resume production of our affected products  if our customers cannot timely resume their own manufacturing following such an event  they may cancel or scale back their orders from us and this may in turn adversely affect our results of operations 
from time to time  customers may require rapid increases in production  for example when they are ramping up for a new product launch  such as a new generation smartphone  which can challenge our resources and reduce margins 
we may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or components or secure sufficient contract manufacturing capacity  to meet such increases in product demand 
this could harm our reputation  prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities  reduce revenue growth and subject us to additional liabilities if we are not able to timely satisfy customer orders 
in order to secure components for the production of our products  we may enter into non cancelable purchase commitments with vendors or make advance payments to suppliers  which could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands 
prior commitments of this type have resulted in an excess of parts when demand for our products has decreased 
downturns in the semiconductor industry have in the past caused  and may in the future cause  our customers to reduce significantly the amount of products ordered from us 
if demand for our products is less than we expect  we may experience excess and obsolete inventories and be forced to incur additional charges 
conversely  if oems order more of our products in any particular quarter than are ultimately required to satisfy end customer demand  inventories at these oems may grow in such quarter  which could adversely affect our product revenues in a subsequent quarter as such oems would likely reduce future orders until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand 
in addition  because certain of our sales  research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed  a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income 
we rely on third parties to provide corporate infrastructure services necessary for the operation of our business 
any failure of one or more of our vendors to provide these services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on third party vendors to provide critical corporate infrastructure services  including  among other things  certain services related to accounting  billing  human resources  benefit plan administration  information technology  or it  network development and network monitoring 
we depend on these vendors to ensure that our corporate infrastructure will consistently meet our business requirements 
the ability of these third party vendors to successfully provide reliable  high quality services is subject to technical and operational uncertainties that are beyond our control 
while we may be entitled to damages if our vendors fail to perform under their agreements with us  our agreements with these vendors limit the amount of damages we may receive 
in addition  we do not know whether we will be able to collect on any award of damages or that any such damages would be sufficient to cover the actual costs we would incur as a result of any vendor failure to perform under its agreement with us 
any failure of our corporate infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
upon expiration or termination of any of our agreements with third party vendors  we may not be able to replace the services provided to us in a timely manner or on terms and conditions  including service levels and cost  that are favorable to us and a transition from one vendor to another vendor could subject us to operational delays and inefficiencies until the transition is complete 
our gross margin is dependent on a number of factors  including our product mix  customer mix  commodity prices  non product revenue  acquisitions we may make and level of capacity utilization 
our gross margin is highly dependent on product mix  with proprietary products and products sold into our industrial other target market typically providing higher gross margin than other products 
a shift in sales mix away from our higher margin products could adversely affect our future gross margin percentages 
in addition  oems are becoming increasingly price conscious when they design semiconductors from third party suppliers into their products 
this sensitivity  combined with large oems purchasing power  can lead to intense price competition among competing suppliers  which may require us 
table of contents to decrease our prices in order to win a design with an oem customer 
this can  in turn  adversely affect our gross margin 
our margin may also be affected by fluctuations in commodity prices  either directly in the price of the raw materials we buy  or as a result of prices increases passed on to us by our suppliers 
we do not hedge our exposure to commodity prices  some of which including gold and fuel prices are very volatile  and sudden or prolonged increases in commodities prices may adversely affect our gross margin 
our gross margin is also affected by the timing and amount of our non product revenue  including non refundable payments from customers for research and development projects during product development and intellectual property related revenue such as licensing royalty payments and revenues from sales of intellectual property 
our non product revenue is generally high margin  but fluctuates significantly from quarter to quarter 
businesses or companies that we may acquire from time to time may have different gross margin profiles than us and could  therefore  affect our overall gross margin 
for example  cyoptics products typically carry a lower gross margin  on average  than avago products and  as a result  the acquisition of cyoptics may have an adverse effect on our gross margin unless we are able to improve the gross margins of the acquired business 
in addition  semiconductor manufacturing requires significant capital investment  leading to high fixed costs  including depreciation expense 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we do retain some semiconductor fabrication facilities 
we are making substantial capital investments in our fort collins  colorado manufacturing facility and we may not realize the benefit we anticipate from these investments 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a high level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities  such as depreciation expense  will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
in the past  we have experienced periods where our gross margins declined due to  among other things  reduced factory utilization resulting from reduced customer demand  reduced selling prices and a change in product mix towards lower margin devices 
increased competition and the existence of product alternatives  more complex engineering requirements  lower demand  reductions in our technological lead  compared to our competitors  and other factors may lead to further price erosion  lower revenues and lower margins for us in the future 
if the tax incentive or tax holiday arrangements we have negotiated in singapore and other jurisdictions change or cease to be in effect or applicable  in part or in whole  for any reason  or if our assumptions and interpretations regarding tax laws and incentive or holiday arrangements prove to be incorrect  the amount of corporate income taxes we have to pay could significantly increase 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and renewals and extensions of such tax incentives are in the discretion of the singapore government  and we may not be able to extend these tax incentive arrangements after their expiration on similar terms or at all 
we may elect not to seek to renew or extend certain tax incentive arrangements 
absent these tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 
in february  the malaysian government granted us a tax holiday on our qualifying malaysian income  which is effective for years beginning with our fiscal year the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia and other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot  or elect not to  comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits 
in such event  we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 
any such modified structure or strategy may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
for the fiscal years ended november   october  and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million  million  and million  respectively  and increase diluted net income per share by  and  respectively 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our 
table of contents operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm length standard among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
we are subject to  and are under  audit in various jurisdictions  and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us 
although we believe our tax positions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our recorded income tax provisions and accruals 
the ultimate results of an audit could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights or demands that we license third party technology  which could result in significant expense and loss of our intellectual property rights 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by companies holding large numbers of patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets and by the vigorous pursuit  protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights  including actions by patent holding companies that do not make or sell products 
from time to time  third parties assert against us and our customers and distributors their patent  copyright  trademark  trade secret and other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business 
litigation or settlement of claims that our products or processes infringe or misappropriate these rights  regardless of their merit  are frequently costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  many of our customer agreements  and in some cases our asset sale agreements  require us to indemnify our customers or purchasers for third party intellectual property infringement claims  which have required and may in the future require that we defend those claims  and might require that we pay damages in the case of adverse rulings 
claims of this sort could also harm our relationships with our customers and might deter future customers from doing business with us 
we do not know whether we will prevail in such proceedings given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation 
if any pending or future proceedings result in an adverse outcome  we could be required to cease the manufacture  use or sale of the infringing products  processes or technology  pay substantial damages for past  present and future use of the infringing technology  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  license technology from the third party claiming infringement  which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  enter into cross licenses with our competitors  which could weaken our overall intellectual property portfolio and our ability to compete in particular product categories  indemnify customers or distributors  pay substantial damages to our customers or end users to discontinue use or replace infringing technology with non infringing technology  or relinquish intellectual property rights associated with one or more of our patent claims  if such claims are held invalid or otherwise unenforceable 
any of the foregoing results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we utilize a significant amount of intellectual property in our business 
if we are unable or fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends in part upon protecting our intellectual property 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights  including patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property  as well as customary contractual protections with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights  and even with significant expenditures we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights valuable to our business 
we are unable to predict that intellectual property rights that we presently employ in our business will not lapse or be invalidated  circumvented  challenged  or  in the case of third party intellectual property rights  licensed or sub licensed to us  be licensed to others  our intellectual property rights will provide competitive advantages to us  rights previously granted by third parties to intellectual property rights licensed or assigned to us  including portfolio cross licenses  will not hamper our ability to assert our intellectual property rights against potential competitors or hinder the settlement of currently pending or future disputes  
table of contents any of our pending or future patent  trademark or copyright applications will be issued or have the coverage originally sought  or our intellectual property rights will be enforced in certain jurisdictions where competition may be intense or where legal protection may be weak 
in addition  our competitors or others may develop products or technologies that are similar or superior to our products or technologies  duplicate our products or technologies or design around our protected technologies 
effective patent  trademark  copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or more limited in one or more relevant jurisdictions  relative to those protections available in the united states  may not be applied for or may be abandoned in one or more relevant jurisdictions 
we may elect to abandon or divest patents or otherwise not pursue prosecution of certain pending patent applications  due to strategic concerns or other factors 
in addition  when patents expire  we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us 
from time to time we pursue litigation to assert our intellectual property rights  including  in some cases  against third parties with whom we have ongoing relationships  such as customers and suppliers  and third parties may pursue litigation against us 
an adverse decision in such types of legal action could limit our ability to assert our intellectual property rights and limit the value of our technology  including the loss of opportunities to sell or license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property against others 
in addition  such legal actions or adverse decisions could otherwise negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time we may need to obtain additional intellectual property licenses or renew existing license agreements 
we are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to attract  train and retain qualified personnel  especially our design and technical personnel  we may not be able to execute our business strategy effectively 
our future success depends on our ability to retain  attract and motivate qualified personnel  including our management  sales and marketing  legal and finance personnel  and especially our design and technical personnel 
we also seek to acquire talented engineering and technical personnel through acquisitions we may make from time to time  including  for example  cyoptics and javelin 
we do not know whether we will be able to retain all of these employees as we continue to pursue our business strategy 
we have historically encountered difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified engineers because there is a limited pool of engineers with expertise in analog and optoelectronic semiconductor design 
competition for such personnel is intense in the semiconductor industry  particularly in southeast asia where qualified engineers are in high demand 
in addition  employees of companies or businesses that we acquire may decide not to continue working for us  with little or no notice  for reasons that may include dissatisfaction with our corporate culture  compensation or new roles and responsibilities 
as the source of our technological and product innovations  our design and technical personnel represent a significant asset 
the loss of the services of key employees  especially our key design and technical personnel  or our inability to retain  attract and motivate qualified design and technical personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to warranty claims  product recalls and product liability 
from time to time we may be  subject to warranty or product liability claims that have lead  and may in the future lead  to significant expenses as we compensate affected customers for costs incurred related to product quality issues 
although we maintain reserves for reasonably estimable liabilities and purchase product liability insurance  our reserves may be inadequate to cover the uninsured portion of such claims 
conversely  in some cases  amounts we reserve may ultimately exceed our actual liability for particular claims and may need to be reversed 
although we maintain product liability insurance  such insurance is subject to significant deductibles and there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or adequate to protect against all such claims  or we may elect to self insure with respect to certain matters 
we may incur costs and expenses in the event of any recall of a customer product containing one of our devices 
the process of identifying a recalled product in devices that have been widely distributed may be lengthy and require significant resources  and we may incur significant replacement costs  contract damage claims from our customers and reputational harm 
our customer contracts typically contain warranty and indemnification provisions  and in certain cases may also contain liquidated damages provisions  relating to product quality issues 
the potential liabilities associated with such provisions are significant  and in some cases  including in agreements with some of our largest customers  are potentially unlimited 
any such liabilities may greatly exceed any revenues we receive from the relevant products 
costs  payments or damages incurred or paid by us in connection with warranty and product liability claims and product recalls could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses or undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products  damage our reputation with current or prospective customers  and materially and adversely affect our operating costs 
highly complex products such as those we offer  may contain defects and bugs when they are first introduced or as new versions are released  or their release may be delayed due to unforeseen difficulties during product development 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  such defects  bugs and delays 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  we may not be able to successfully design workarounds 
consequently  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers  and our financial results 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
to resolve these problems  we may have to invest significant capital and other resources 
although our products are tested by our suppliers  our customers and ourselves  it is possible that our new products will contain defects or bugs 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
for example  if a delay in the manufacture and delivery of our products causes the delay of a customer product delivery  we may be required  under the terms of our agreement with that customer  to compensate the customer for the adverse effects of such delays 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts  and we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
as a result  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with our distributors product inventories and product sell through 
we sell many of our products to customers through distributors who maintain their own inventory of our products for sale to dealers and end users 
we limit distributor return rights and we allow limited price adjustments on sales to distributors 
price adjustments may be effected by way of credits for future product or by cash payments to the distributor either in arrears or in advance based on estimates 
we record reserves for distributor rights related to these limited stock returns and price adjustments 
we recognize revenues for sales to distributors upon delivery to the distributors  net of estimated provisions for these stock return and price adjustment programs 
we have extended these programs to certain distributors in the united states  asia and europe and may extend them on a selective basis to some of our other distributors in these geographies 
the reserves recorded for these programs are based on significant judgments and estimates  using historical experience rates  inventory levels in distribution  current trends and other factors  and there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
these programs may require us to deploy a substantial amount of cash to fund them 
as at november   we had an aggregate of approximately million on deposit with various distributors to fund these programs 
the timing and mix of payments and credits associated with such price adjustments could change over time  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
if our distributors are unable to sell an adequate amount of their inventory of our products in a given quarter to dealers and end users or if they decide to decrease their inventories for any reason  such as due to adverse global economic conditions or due to any downturn in technology spending  our sales to these distributors and our revenues may decline 
we also face the risk that our distributors may purchase  or for other reasons accumulate  inventory levels of our products in any particular quarter in excess of future anticipated sales to end customers 
if such sales do not occur in the time frame anticipated by these distributors for any reason  these distributors may substantially decrease the amount of product they order from us in subsequent periods until their inventory levels realign with end customer demand  which would harm our business and could adversely affect our product revenues in such subsequent periods 
our reserve estimates associated with products stocked by our distributors are based largely on reports that our distributors provide to us on a weekly or monthly basis 
to date  we believe this data has been generally accurate 
to the extent that this resale and channel inventory data is inaccurate or not received in a timely manner  we may not be able to make reserve estimates for future periods accurately or at all 
we do not always have a direct relationship with the end customers of our products sold through distributors 
as a result  our products may be used in or for applications for which they were not necessarily designed or tested  including  for example  medical devices  and they may not perform as anticipated in such applications 
in such event  failure of even a small number of parts could result in significant liabilities to us  damage our reputation and harm our business and results of operations 
unless we and our suppliers continuously improve manufacturing efficiency and quality  our financial performance could be adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductors involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our suppliers  as well as our competitors  continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
defects or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can reduce yields and increase costs 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future financial performance  and we may be unable to maintain or increase our 
table of contents manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
for products that we outsource manufacturing  our product yields and performance will be subject to the manufacturing efficiencies of our third party suppliers 
from time to time  we and our suppliers have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities  achieving and maintaining a high level of process quality and effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes  all of which have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we and our suppliers may experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or experience product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities  including our fort collins facility  or changing our process technologies  any of which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by any increase in costs related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
the enactment of legislation implementing changes in us taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other international tax reform policies or principles could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
tax bills are introduced from time to time to reform us taxation of international business activities 
depending on the final form of legislation enacted  if any  these consequences may be significant for us due to the large scale of our international business activities 
if any of these proposals are enacted into legislation  or if other international  consensus based tax policies and principles are amended or implemented  they could have material adverse consequences on the amount of tax we pay and thereby on our financial position and results of operations 
we make substantial investments in research and development to improve existing and develop new technologies to remain competitive in our business and unsuccessful investments could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor industry requires substantial investment in research and development in order to develop and bring to market new and enhanced technologies and products 
in order to remain competitive  we have made significant investments in research and development and anticipate that we will need to maintain or increase our levels of research and development expenditures 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
the technologies where we have focused or may focus our research and development expenditures may not become commercially successful 
significant investments in unsuccessful research and development efforts could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  increased investments in research and development could cause our cost structure to fall out of alignment with demand for our products  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
our business would be adversely affected by the departure of existing members of our senior management team or if our senior management team is unable to effectively implement our strategy 
our success depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our senior management team  in particular  the services of mr 
hock e 
tan  our president and chief executive officer and mr 
bryan t 
ingram  our senior vice president and chief operating officer 
none of our senior management is bound by written employment contracts to remain with us for a specified period 
in addition  we do not currently maintain key person life insurance covering our senior management 
the loss of any of our senior management could harm our ability to implement our business strategy and respond to the rapidly changing market conditions in which we operate 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations 
we sell our products throughout the world 
in addition  as at november   approximately of our employees are located outside of the united states 
multiple factors relating to our international operations and to particular countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these factors include changes in political  regulatory  legal or economic conditions  restrictive governmental actions  such as restrictions on the transfer or repatriation of funds and foreign investments and trade protection measures  including export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs  disruptions of capital and trading markets  changes in import or export licensing requirements  transportation delays  
table of contents civil disturbances or political instability  geopolitical turmoil  including terrorism  war or political or military coups  changes in labor standards  limitations on our ability under local laws to protect our intellectual property  nationalization of businesses and expropriation of assets  changes in tax laws  currency fluctuations  which may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers or foreign sourced materials and services becoming more expensive for us  and difficulty in obtaining distribution and support 
a significant legal risk associated with conducting business internationally is compliance with various and differing anti corruption and anti bribery laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business  including the us foreign corrupt practices act  the uk bribery act and similar laws in china 
in addition  the anti corruption laws in various countries are constantly evolving and may  in some cases  conflict with each other 
our code of ethics and business conduct and other policies prohibit us and our employees from offering or giving anything of value to a government official for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business and from engaging in unethical business practices  including kick backs to or from purely private parties 
however  there can be no assurance that all of our employees or agents will refrain from acting in violation of this and our related anti corruption policies and procedures 
any such violation could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a majority of our products are produced and sourced in asia  including in china  malaysia  the philippines  singapore  south korea  taiwan and thailand 
as a result of the acquisition of cyoptics  we also have facilities and personnel in  and conduct business from  mexico  an area in which we have not previously operated 
any conflict or uncertainty in these countries  including due to political or civil unrest  public health or safety concerns or natural disasters  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if the government of any country in which our products are manufactured or sold sets technical standards for products manufactured in or imported into their country that are not widely shared  it may lead certain of our customers to suspend imports of their products into that country  require manufacturers in that country to manufacture products with different technical standards and disrupt cross border manufacturing relationships which  in each case  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our subsidiaries may require future equity related financing  and any capital contributions to certain of our subsidiaries may require the approval of the relevant authorities in the jurisdiction in which the subsidiary is incorporated 
the approvals are required from the investment commissions or similar agency of the particular jurisdiction and relate to any initial or additional equity investment by foreign entities in local corporations 
our failure to obtain the required approvals and our resulting inability to provide such equity related financing or capital contributions could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not realize the full benefits of our research and development grants 
we have accepted research and development grants  the receipt and amount of which are subject to our compliance with specified terms and conditions  both individually and in the aggregate 
during fiscal year  we recorded an aggregate of million in credits to research and development expense and million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants 
during fiscal year  we recorded an aggregate of million in credits to research and development expense and million as a deferred credit for capital expenditures pursuant to these grants 
if we cannot or elect not to satisfy the terms and conditions of any of these grants  expenses incurred in respect of the relevant research and development projects will not be approved for reimbursement  we may be required to return amounts previously paid to us under the grants and further grants may not be available to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to comply with the terms of any such grant  we may seek to amend the terms 
however  any amendment  extension or renewal of such grants is in the discretion of the granting authority and we may not be able to effect any such change 
our business is subject to various governmental regulations  and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expenses 
if we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations  we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our business is subject to various significant international and us laws and other legal requirements  including packaging  product content  labor and import export regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have generally become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
certain cyoptics products  when customized for use with or incorporation into a 
table of contents defense article  are subject to the jurisdiction of the us department of state in accordance with the international traffic in arms regulation  or itar 
we have not previously had to comply with itar and are currently integrating cyoptics itar controls and compliance with our own programs 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations  including itar  could result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  product recalls or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations 
in addition  because many of our products are regulated or sold into regulated industries  we must comply with additional regulations in marketing our products 
our products and operations are also subject to the rules of industrial standards bodies  like the international standards organization  as well as regulation by other agencies  such as the us federal communications commission 
if we fail to adequately address any of these rules or regulations  our business could be harmed 
we must conform the manufacture and distribution of our semiconductors to various laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change 
if we fail to comply with these requirements in the manufacture or distribution of our products  we could be required to pay civil penalties  face criminal prosecution and  in some cases  be prohibited from distributing our products commercially until the products or component substances are brought into compliance 
we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  which could increase our costs  restrict our operations and require expenditures that could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to a variety of international and us laws and other legal requirements relating to the use  disposal  clean up of and human exposure to  hazardous materials 
any failure by us to comply with environmental  health and safety requirements could result in the limitation or suspension of production or subject us to future liabilities in excess of our reserves 
in addition  compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly pollution control equipment  incur other significant expenses or modify our manufacturing processes 
in the event of the discovery of new contamination  additional requirements with respect to existing contamination  or the imposition of other cleanup obligations for which we are responsible  we may be required to take remedial or other measures which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products  including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that apply to specified electronics products sold in the european union as of july  under the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment directive 
other countries  such as the united states  china and japan  have enacted or may enact laws or regulations similar to the eu legislation 
other environmental regulations may require us to re engineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible 
such re engineering and component substitution may result in excess inventory or other additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental  health and safety requirements  we may in the future incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by government agencies and private parties 
we may be defendants in lawsuits brought by parties in the future alleging environmental damage  personal injury or property damage 
a significant judgment against us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the last few years  there has been increased media scrutiny and associated reports focusing on a potential link between working in semiconductor manufacturing clean room environments and certain illnesses  primarily different types of cancers 
regulatory agencies and industry associations have begun to study the issue to see if any actual correlation exists 
because we utilize clean rooms  we may become subject to liability claims 
in addition  these reports may also affect our ability to recruit and retain employees 
we cannot predict changes in environmental or health and safety laws or regulations  the manner in which environmental or health and safety laws or regulations will be enforced  administered or interpreted  our ability to enforce and collect under indemnity agreements and insurance policies relating to environmental liabilities  or the cost of compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or the costs associated with any future environmental claims  including the cost of clean up of currently unknown environmental conditions  particularly at sites that we may acquire from time to time 

table of contents new regulations related to conflict minerals may force us to incur additional expenses  may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers 
pursuant to the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  or the dodd frank act  the sec has adopted new requirements for companies that use certain minerals and metals  known as conflict minerals  in their products  whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties 
these requirements will require companies to diligence  disclose and report whether or not such minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
the implementation of these new requirements could adversely affect the sourcing  availability and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of semiconductor devices  including our products 
in addition  we will incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals and metals used in our products 
since our supply chain is complex  we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins for these minerals and metals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement  which may harm our reputation 
in such event  we may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who require that all of the components of our products are certified as conflict mineral free 
in addition to our employee sales representatives  we also rely on third party distributors to sell our products  as well as using manufacturers representatives in some circumstances  and the failure of these distributors or representatives to perform as expected could reduce our future sales 
in addition to selling products through our employee sales representatives  we also rely on distributors to sell our products to our customers 
in some cases we also use manufacturers representatives to sell our products  particularly  for example  in markets where we do not have a significant physical presence and new markets that we are seeking to enter 
we are unable to predict the extent to which our distributors and manufacturers representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
moreover  many of our distributors and manufacturers representatives also market and sell competing products 
our relationships with our distributors and manufacturers representatives may be terminated by either party at any time 
our future performance will depend  in part  on our ability to attract additional distributors or manufacturers representatives that will be able to market and support our products effectively  especially in markets where we have not previously distributed our products  and on our ability to effectively manage distribution efforts by our remaining global  full line distributors 
if we cannot retain our current distributors or manufacturers representatives  recruit additional or replacement distributors or manufacturers representatives where needed  or effectively manage changes to our sales and distributions strategies  our sales and operating results will be harmed 
the average selling prices of products in our markets have historically decreased rapidly and will likely do so in the future  which could harm our revenues and gross profits 
the products we develop and sell are used for high volume applications 
as a result  the prices of those products have historically decreased rapidly 
gross profits on our products may be negatively affected by  among other things  pricing pressures from our customers  and the proportion of sales of our wireless and other products into consumer application markets  which are highly competitive and cost sensitive 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling prices of our products in anticipation of future competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by us or our competitors and other factors 
in addition  some of our customer agreements provide for volume based pricing and product pricing roadmaps  which can also reduce the average selling prices of our products over time 
our gross margin and financial results will suffer if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes  reducing manufacturing costs  or developing new and higher value added products on a timely basis 
we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any adverse findings from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and ultimately have an adverse effect on our share price 
we are required to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually  as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act 
even though  as at october   we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective  we need to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them as our business grows and changes 
this continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with section is expensive  time consuming and requires significant management attention 
we cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial processes and reporting and ensure compliance with section furthermore  as we grow our business or acquire other businesses  our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure they remain effective 
failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  either in our existing business or in businesses that we may acquire  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
we are in the process of integrating our and cyoptics financial and controls  to ensure the effectiveness of their controls and procedures 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so effectively in the one year post acquisition exemption period or at all 

table of contents if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses in our internal controls  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline 
remediation of a material weakness could require us to incur significant expense and if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate  our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected  our access to the capital markets may be restricted  the trading price of our ordinary shares may decline  and we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities  including the sec or the nasdaq global select market 
we may also be required to restate our financial statements from prior periods 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by employee benefit related costs and expenses 
we sponsor several defined benefit plans outside of the united states and post retirement medical benefit plans in the united states 
we are required to make contributions to these plans to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by laws governing these employee benefit plans 
the difference between the obligations and assets of these plans  or the funded status of these plans  is a significant factor in determining our pension expense and the ongoing funding requirements of these plans 
weak economic conditions and related under performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and post retirement benefit expenses 
we may also seek to move defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans and any such changes may adversely affect our results of operations  including our profitability and cash flow 
in the united states  we also self fund a significant portion of our employees health benefits 
the costs of providing these benefits has been increasing steadily and significantly  and may increase further as the patient protection and affordable care act of is implemented 
also  a significant portion of our employees cash compensation is performance related  based on achievement of annual metrics  which can cause significant fluctuations in our employee compensation expense  and in cashflows in the period in which payment occurs 
significant increases in the compensation  costs and expenses of the benefits we provide to our employees could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
a breach of our security systems may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our security systems are designed to maintain the physical security of our facilities and protect our customers  suppliers and employees confidential information 
however  we are also dependent on a number of third party cloud based service providers of critical corporate infrastructure services relating to  among other things  human resources  electronic communication services and certain finance functions  and we are  of necessity  dependent on the security systems of these providers 
accidental or willful security breaches or other unauthorized access by third parties to our facilities  our information systems or the systems of our cloud based service providers or the existence of computer viruses in our or their data or software could expose us to a risk of information loss and misappropriation of proprietary and confidential information 
any theft or misuse of such information could result in  among other things  unfavorable publicity  damage to our reputation  difficulty in marketing our products  allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations  litigation by affected parties and possible financial obligations for liabilities and damages related to the theft or misuse of such information  as well as fines and other sanctions resulting from any related breaches of data privacy regulations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and financial condition 
since the techniques used to obtain unauthorized share repurchase program access or to sabotage systems change frequently and are often not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
risks relating to investments in singapore companies it may be difficult to enforce a judgment of us courts for civil liabilities under us federal securities laws against us  our directors or officers in singapore 
we are incorporated under the laws of the republic of singapore  and certain of our officers and directors are resident outside the united states 
moreover  a majority of our consolidated assets are located outside the united states 
although we are incorporated outside the united states  we have agreed to accept service of process in the united states through our agent designated for that purpose 
nevertheless  since a majority of the consolidated assets owned by us are located outside the united states  any judgment obtained in the united states against us may not be collectible within the united states 
there is no treaty between the united states and singapore providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters and a final judgment for the payment of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability  whether or not predicated solely upon the federal securities laws  would  therefore  not be automatically enforceable in singapore 
there is doubt whether a singapore court may impose civil liability on us or our directors and officers who reside in singapore in a suit brought in the singapore courts against us or such persons with respect to a violation solely of the federal securities laws of the united states  unless the facts surrounding such a violation 
table of contents would constitute or give rise to a cause of action under singapore law 
consequently  it may be difficult for investors to enforce against us  our directors or our officers in singapore judgments obtained in the united states  which are predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states 
we are incorporated in singapore and our shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states  and we may have more difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executives 
our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association and by the laws governing corporations incorporated in singapore 
the rights of our shareholders and the responsibilities of the members of our board of directors under singapore law are different from those applicable to a corporation incorporated in the united states 
therefore  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interest in connection with actions taken by our management or members of our board of directors than they would as shareholders of a corporation incorporated in the united states 
draft legislation that would make significant changes to the singapore companies act has recently been proposed by the singapore authorities  some of which may alter the rights of shareholders that are currently provided under the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association 
however  it is not yet certain which of these amendments will be included in the final legislation or when such amendments will become effective 
in addition  being a public company incorporated in singapore may make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on committees of our board  and qualified executive officers 
for a limited period of time  our directors have general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as may be determined by our board of directors in its sole discretion 
under singapore law  we may only allot and issue new ordinary shares with the prior approval of our shareholders in a general meeting 
at our agm  our shareholders provided our directors with the general authority to allot and issue any number of new ordinary shares until the earlier of i the conclusion of our agm  ii the expiration of the period within which the next annual general meeting is required to be held ie within months from the conclusion of the last general meeting or iii the subsequent revocation or modification of such general authority by our shareholders acting at a duly noticed and convened meeting 
subject to the general authority to allot and issue new ordinary shares provided by our shareholders  the provisions of the singapore companies act and our memorandum and articles of association  our board of directors may allot and issue new ordinary shares on terms and conditions as they may think fit to impose 
any additional issuances of new ordinary shares by our directors may adversely impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
risks relating to owning our ordinary shares at times  our share price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future  which could result in substantial losses for our investors 
the trading price of our ordinary shares has  at times  fluctuated significantly 
the trading price of our ordinary shares could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many of the risk factors listed in this risk factors section  and others  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results  issuance of new or updated research or reports by securities analysts  fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us  announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors  announcements of  or expectations of additional debt or equity financing efforts  share price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares  and changes in our dividend or share repurchase policies 
these fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance 
these broad market and industry fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions such as recessions  interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations  may negatively impact the market price of our ordinary shares 
you may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation 
we may be the target of this 
table of contents type of litigation in the future 
securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention from other business concerns  which could seriously harm our business 
a substantial amount of our shares are held by a small number of institutional investors and significant sales of our ordinary shares in the public market by one or more of these holders could cause our share price to fall 
as of september   we believe that our five largest shareholders are institutional investors and that they hold over of our outstanding ordinary shares in the aggregate 
these institutional investors may sell their shares for a variety of reasons  including dissatisfaction with our short or long term results 
these holders may sell their shares at any time and such sales could depress the market price of our ordinary shares  given the large amounts of our shares held by these investors 
such sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase shares 
our board adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which the company will pay quarterly dividends on our ordinary shares  and  following our agm on april   our board approved our share repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase up to million of the company ordinary shares  in their discretion  which authorization will expire the day prior to our agm 
the declaration and payment of any future dividend is subject to the approval of our board and our dividend policy could change at any time 
similarly  our share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or terminated at any time prior to its expiration 
there can be no assurance that we will declare cash dividends or repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts  or at all 
furthermore  we may declare dividends as interim dividends  which are wholly provisional under singapore law and may be revoked by our board at any time prior to the payment thereof 
the payment of cash dividends is restricted by applicable law and our corporate structure 
pursuant to singapore law and our articles of association  no dividends may be paid except out of our profits 
also  because we are a holding company  our ability to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares and to repurchase our shares may be limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain sufficient funds through dividends from subsidiaries  including restrictions under the terms of our credit agreement 
while our cash dividend payments have historically increased over time  this trend may not continue any may be discontinued or reduced at any time 
future dividends and share repurchases  if any  their timing and amount  as well as the relative allocation of cash between dividends and share repurchases  may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for strategic transactions  including acquisitions  earnings levels  contractual restrictions  cash position and overall financial condition  and changes to our business model 
in addition  the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our share repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors  including the share price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares 
a reduction in  or elimination of  our dividend payments and or share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price 
singapore corporate law may impede a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
the singapore code on take overs and mergers contains provisions that may delay  deter or prevent a future takeover or change in control of our company for so long as we remain a public company with more than shareholders and net tangible assets of s million or more 
any person acquiring an interest  whether by a series of transactions over a period of time or not  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  in or more of our voting shares  or  if such person holds  either on their own or together with parties acting in concert with such person  between and both inclusive of our voting shares  and such person or parties acting in concert with such person acquires additional voting shares representing more than of our voting shares in any six month period  must  except with the consent of the securities industry council in singapore  extend a mandatory takeover offer for the remaining voting shares in accordance with the provisions of the singapore code on take overs and mergers 
while the singapore code on take overs and mergers seeks to ensure equality of treatment among shareholders  its provisions may discourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change of control of our company 
these legal requirements may impede or delay a takeover of our company by a third party  which could adversely affect the value of our ordinary shares 
our actual operating results may differ significantly from our guidance 
from time to time  we release guidance regarding our future performance that represents our management estimates as of the date of release 
this guidance  which consists of forward looking statements  is prepared by our management and is qualified by  and subject to  the assumptions and the other information contained or referred to in the release 
our guidance is not prepared with a view toward compliance with published guidelines of the american institute of certified public accountants  and neither our independent registered public accounting firm nor any other independent expert or outside party compiles or examines the guidance and  accordingly  no such person expresses any opinion or any other form of assurance with respect thereto 

table of contents guidance is based upon a number of assumptions and estimates that  while presented with numerical specificity  is inherently subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies  many of which are beyond our control and are based upon specific assumptions with respect to future business decisions  some of which will change 
we generally state possible outcomes as high and low ranges which are intended to provide a sensitivity analysis as variables are changed but are not intended to represent that actual results could not fall outside of the suggested ranges 
the principal reason that we release this data is to provide a basis for our management to discuss our business outlook with analysts and investors 
we do not accept any responsibility for any projections or reports published by any such persons 
guidance is necessarily speculative in nature  and it can be expected that some or all of the assumptions of the guidance furnished by us will not materialize or will vary significantly from actual results  particularly any guidance relating to the results of operations of acquired businesses or companies  such as cyoptics  as our management will  necessarily  be less familiar with their business  procedures and operations 
accordingly  our guidance is only an estimate of what management believes is realizable as of the date of release 
actual results will vary from the guidance and the variations may be material 
investors should also recognize that the reliability of any forecasted financial data diminishes the farther in the future that the data is forecast 
in light of the foregoing  investors are urged to put the guidance in context and not to place undue reliance on it 
any failure to successfully implement our operating strategy or the occurrence of any of the events or circumstances set forth in this annual report on form k could result in the actual operating results being different than the guidance  and such differences may be adverse and material

in fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit totaling million 
the income tax benefit is associated with the release of million of deferred tax asset valuation allowances  mainly associated with the company irrevocably calling our senior subordinated notes for redemption in october  partially offset by the write off of million of deferred tax assets resulting from the grant of malaysia tax incentive status  and an increase in overall tax provision due to an increase in worldwide taxable income 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors or in other parts of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading designer  developer and global supplier of a broad range of analog semiconductor devices with a focus on iii v based products 
iii v semiconductor materials have higher electrical conductivity than silicon and thus tend to have better performance characteristics in radio frequency  or rf  and optoelectronic applications 
iii v refers to elements from the rd and th groups in the periodic table of chemical elements  and examples of these materials are gallium arsenide  or gaas  gallium nitride  or gan  and indium phosphide  or inp 
we differentiate ourselves through our high performance design and integration capabilities 
we serve three primary target markets wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial other 
our product portfolio is extensive and includes thousands of products 
applications for our products in these target markets include smartphones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  factory automation and industrial equipment 
we have an over year history of innovation  dating back to our origins within hewlett packard company 
over the years  we have assembled a large team of analog design engineers around the world 
we maintain design and product development engineering resources at multiple locations in each of the united states  asia and europe  which allows us to leverage this worldwide engineering expertise 
our history and market position enable us to strategically focus our research and development resources to address niche opportunities in our target markets 
we have also developed an extensive portfolio of us and foreign patents and other intellectual property  and we leverage our significant intellectual property portfolio to integrate multiple technologies and create component solutions that target growth opportunities 
we design products that deliver high performance and provide mission critical functionality 
in particular  we were among the first to deliver commercial film bulk acoustic resonator  or fbar  filters which offer technological advantages over competing filters for smartphones to function more efficiently in today congested rf spectrum 
fbar technology has historically maintained a significant market share within code division multiple access  or cdma  and g w cdma markets 
as cellular carriers move to the g long term evolution  or lte  and lte advanced standards worldwide  we believe these advantages will continue to facilitate rapid adoption of fbar technology throughout the mobile phone ecosystems 
in optical solutions  we were a pioneer in commercializing vertical cavity surface emitting laser  or vcsel 
our fiber optic products and our vcsel based products  including high bandwidth parallel optic transceivers and modules  have been widely adopted throughout the wired infrastructure and computing industries 
in optoelectronics  we are a market leader in optocoupler and optical encoder solutions 
original equipment manufacturers  or oems  and distributors typically account for the substantial majority of our sales 
we have established strong relationships with leading oem customers across multiple target markets 
many of our major customer relationships have been in place multiple years and we have supplied multiple products during that time period 
our close customer relationships have often been built as a result of years of collaborative product development which has enabled us to build our intellectual property portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customer s requirements  including substantial system level knowledge 
this collaboration has provided us with key insights into our customers and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers 
we have a direct sales force focused on supporting large oems 
we also distribute a substantial portion of our products through our broad distribution network  and a significant amount of these sales are to large global electronic components distributors  including avnet  inc and arrow electronics  inc we also have a diversified and well established base of thousands of end customers  located throughout the world  which we serve through our multi channel sales and fulfillment system 
we focus on maintaining an efficient global supply chain and a variable  low cost operating model 
accordingly  we have outsourced a majority of our manufacturing operations utilizing third party foundry and assembly and test capabilities  as well as some of our corporate infrastructure functions 
we aim to minimize capital expenditures by focusing our internal manufacturing capacity on products utilizing our innovative materials and processes to protect our intellectual property and to develop the technology for manufacturing  while outsourcing standard complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  processes 
we also have over years of operating history in asia  where approximately of our employees are located and where we produce and source the majority of our products 
our presence in asia places us in close proximity to many of our customers manufacturing facilities and at the center of worldwide electronics manufacturing 

table of contents our business is impacted by general conditions of the semiconductor industry  seasonal demand patterns in our target markets  to some extent  and the timing of major product launches by our oem customers  particularly in our wireless target market 
in recent years our wireless target market has typically accounted for the largest portion of our revenue 
however  we believe that our focus on multiple target markets and geographies helps mitigate our exposure to volatility in any single target market 
erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry 
consistent with trends in the industry  we anticipate that average selling prices will continue to decline in the future 
however  as part of our normal course of business  we seek to offset declining average selling prices with efforts to reduce manufacturing costs of existing products and the introduction of new and higher value added products 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue 
sales to distributors accounted for and of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended november  and october   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended november   or fiscal year  foxconn technology group companies  or foxconn  accounted for of our net revenue  and our top direct ten customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
during the fiscal year ended october   or fiscal year  foxconn accounted for of our net revenue and our top ten customers  which included three distributors  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we believe our aggregate sales to apple  inc and cisco systems  inc  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  for fiscal year and fiscal year we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from  any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and is likely to continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including the following general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and in our target markets  our ability to define specifications for  develop or acquire  complete  introduce and market  new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of expected customer orders and our ability to manage inventory  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  and the rate at which our customers products that include our technology are accepted in their markets  and the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
current uncertainty in global economic conditions  including the economic recovery in the united states and the level of growth in china  still poses significant risks to our business 
for example  customers may defer purchases in response to tighter credit and negative financial news  which would in turn negatively affect product demand and our results of operations 
net revenue substantially all of our net revenue is derived from sales of semiconductor devices which our customers incorporate into electronic products 
we serve three primary target markets wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial other 
applications for our products in these target markets include smartphones  consumer appliances  data networking and telecommunications equipment  enterprise storage and servers  factory automation and industrial equipment 
we sell our products primarily through our direct sales force  although we may also use manufacturers representatives in particular geographic areas and for new customers 
we also use distributors for a portion of our business and recognize revenue upon delivery of product to the distributors 
such revenue is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market historically represented a small portion of our total net revenue 
as this became a mature and non strategic market for us  during fiscal year  we transitioned from manufacturing and selling products to selling and licensing intellectual property relevant to this market 
this transition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and we now generate royalty revenue instead of product sales from this former target market 
due to the structure of these licensing arrangements  royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
beginning with fiscal year  we ceased to separately present or discuss revenues from the consumer and computing peripherals target market 
instead  they have been combined with revenues from our industrial and automotive electronics target market  which is referred to as our industrial other target market 
costs and expenses total cost of products sold 
cost of products sold consists primarily of the cost of semiconductor wafers and other materials  and the cost of assembly and test 
cost of products sold also includes personnel costs and overhead related to our manufacturing operations  including share based compensation  and related occupancy  computer services and equipment costs  
table of contents manufacturing quality  order fulfillment  warranty and inventory adjustments  including write downs for inventory obsolescence  energy costs  other manufacturing expenses and acquisition related costs 
total cost of products sold also includes amortization of intangible assets and restructuring charges 
although we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  we also have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication and assembly and test facilities 
if we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication and assembly and test facilities at a desired level  the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed  resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies  including share based compensation expense 
these expenses also include project material costs  third party fees paid to consultants  prototype development expenses  allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses  computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process and acquisition related costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel  including share based compensation expense  sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives  costs of advertising  trade shows  corporate marketing  promotion  travel related to our sales and marketing operations  related occupancy and equipment costs and other marketing costs 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management  finance  human resources and other administrative personnel  outside professional fees  allocated facilities costs  acquisition related costs and other corporate expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
in connection with acquisitions  we recorded intangible assets that are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of year to years 
in connection with these acquisitions  we also recorded goodwill which is not being amortized 
interest expense 
on march   we terminated our senior secured revolving credit facility  and avago technologies finance pte 
ltd  or avago finance  and certain other subsidiaries of the company entered into a credit agreement which initially provided for a million unsecured revolving credit facility  or the credit facility 
on august   avago finance exercised the accordion feature under this credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments for its unsecured revolving credit facility from million to million 
interest expense in fiscal year included commitment fees under our revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with this credit facility 
on october   we terminated the credit facility and avago finance  and certain other subsidiaries of the company entered into a new credit agreement  which initially provides for a million unsecured revolving credit facility  on substantially the same terms as the credit facility  other than the aggregate principal amount of the facility  referred to as the credit facility 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal year  the termination of the credit facility noted above resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  related to the write off of debt amortization costs and other related expenses and is shown on the consolidated statements of operations 
other income  net 
other income  net includes net realized gains on the sale of available for sale securities  realized and unrealized gains on trading securities  gains on the sale of cost method investments  interest income  currency gains losses on balance sheet remeasurement and other miscellaneous items 
provision for income taxes 
we have structured our operations to maximize the benefit from various tax incentives and tax holidays extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment 
for example  we have obtained several tax incentives from the singapore economic development board  an agency of the government of singapore  which provide that certain classes of income we earn in singapore are subject to tax holidays or reduced rates of singapore income tax 
each such tax incentive is separate and distinct from the others  and may be granted  withheld  extended  modified  truncated  complied with or terminated independently without any effect on the other incentives 
in order to retain these tax benefits in singapore  we must meet certain operating conditions specific to each incentive relating to  among other things  maintenance of a treasury function  a corporate headquarters function  specified intellectual property activities and specified manufacturing activities in singapore 
some of these operating conditions are subject to phase in periods through the singapore tax incentives are presently scheduled to expire at various dates generally between and  subject in certain cases to potential extensions 
renewals and extensions of such tax incentives are in the discretion of the singapore government  and we may not be able to extend these tax incentive arrangements after their expiration on similar terms or at all 
we may elect not to seek to renew or extend certain tax incentive arrangements 
absent such tax incentives  the corporate income tax rate in singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 
in february  the malaysian government granted us a tax holiday on our qualifying malaysian income  which is effective for years beginning with our fiscal year the tax incentives that we have negotiated in malaysia and other jurisdictions are also subject to our compliance with various operating and other conditions 
if we cannot  or elect not to  comply with the operating conditions included in any particular tax incentive  we will lose the related tax benefits 
in such event  we could be required to refund material tax benefits previously 
table of contents realized by us with respect to that incentive and  depending on the incentive at issue  could likely be required to modify our operational structure and tax strategy 
any such modified structure may not be as beneficial to us from an income tax expense or operational perspective as the benefits provided under the present tax concession arrangements 
as a result of the tax incentives and tax holidays we have obtained  if we continue to comply with their respective operating conditions  we expect the income from our operations to be subject to relatively lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary income tax rules 
for the fiscal years ended november   october   and october   the effect of all these tax incentives  in the aggregate  was to reduce the overall provision for income taxes from what it otherwise would have been in such year by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our interpretations and conclusions regarding the tax incentives are not binding on any taxing authority  and if our assumptions about tax and other laws are incorrect or if these tax incentives are substantially modified or rescinded we could suffer material adverse tax and other financial consequences  which would increase our expenses  reduce our profitability and adversely affect our cash flows 
in addition  taxable income in any jurisdiction is dependent upon acceptance of our operational practices and intercompany transfer pricing by local tax authorities as being on an arm s length basis 
due to inconsistencies in application of the arm s length standard among taxing authorities  as well as lack of adequate treaty based protection  transfer pricing challenges by tax authorities could  if successful  substantially increase our income tax expense 
going forward  our effective tax rate will vary based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before income taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits and acquisitions we may make from time to time 
in particular  we may owe significant taxes in jurisdictions outside singapore during periods when we are profitable in those jurisdictions even though we may be experiencing low operating profit or operating losses on a consolidated basis  potentially resulting in significant tax liabilities on a consolidated basis during those periods 
our historical provision for income taxes is not necessarily reflective of our future results of operations 
acquisitions and investments acquisitions javelin in the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of javelin semiconductor  inc  or javelin  a us based company engaged in developing mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  integrated circuits  or ics  for wireless communications applications for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition is intended to generate cost savings and form the foundation of the company radio frequency cmos design and development for our wireless target market due to the radio frequency cmos engineering talent and technical personnel and technology that we acquired in this transaction 
cyoptics in the third quarter of fiscal year  we completed our acquisition of cyoptics  inc  or cyoptics  a us based company that manufactures and sells indium phosphide  or inp  optical chip and component technologies for the data communications and telecommunications markets 
cyoptics has front end manufacturing operations in the us and back end manufacturing operations in mexico 
the aggregate consideration for the acquisition was million including a million working capital adjustment payment made in the fiscal quarter ended november   of which million was paid in cash exclusive of million of cash acquired in the transaction 
in addition  approximately million in cash was paid into escrow and is payable to key cyoptics employees in the form of retention bonuses over a three year period  and which we will recognize as compensation expense over the same period 
we also agreed to pay additional consideration to the previous shareholders of cyoptics in the amount of million  one year subsequent to acquisition closing  which was recorded as a current liability 
this transaction is intended to strengthen our fiber optics product portfolio for emerging g and g enterprise and data center applications for our wired infrastructure target market 
cyoptics single mode inp laser  receiver and photonics integration capability is expected to help extend our technology leadership position in these applications 
to date  avago optical transceiver products have primarily leveraged vcsel based technology 
in addition  the acquisition of cyoptics is expected to facilitate avago establishment of a complementary fiber optic components business  not only to serve enterprise and data center segments  but also for growing segments of the access  metro and long haul markets 
our and cyoptics products are complementary to one another  with little overlap between our respective product portfolios 
as a result of the cyoptics acquisition  we acquired approximately  additional employees  with of these employees located in mexico 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results of operations of acquired companies commencing on their respective acquisition dates 
see note acquisitions and investments lsi corporation on december   we entered into a merger agreement with lsi corporation  or lsi  a us publicly traded company that designs semiconductors and software that accelerate storage and networking in datacenters  mobile networks and client computing 
the aggregate acquisition consideration payable in the transaction is approximately billion in cash  or in cash per share of lsi common stock 
the transaction has been approved by the avago and lsi boards of directors and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions  including the receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions  as well as approval of lsi stockholders 
the transaction is presently expected to close in the first half of calendar investments during the first quarter of fiscal year  we invested million in the common stock of a us based stock exchange listed company which is accounted for as a trading securities 
see note fair value 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  in addition to our initial million investment made in fiscal year in a non us based stock exchange listed company resulting in our initial ownership of million ordinary shares  we made an additional investment of million in this company as part of a rights offering to its existing shareholders 
in connection with this additional investment  we purchased approximately million ordinary shares and received approximately million warrants to acquire a corresponding number of ordinary shares of the company per the terms of the rights offerings 
we classified our total investment in the company ordinary shares as available for sale securities and the warrants as trading securities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we exited our entire investment in the ordinary shares and warrants of this company 
for the fiscal year  we realized net gains of million  respectively  from the sale of the ordinary shares and warrants which were recorded in other income  net 
see note other income  net during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we made a cash investment of million in a privately held non us based company 
we accounted for the investment in the equity of this company using the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence or control 
we periodically review cost investments for impairment 
this equity investment is included at cost on the consolidated balance sheets in other long term assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our historical financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies include revenue recognition  business combinations  valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  inventory valuation and warranty reserves  accounting for income taxes  retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions  share based compensation and employee bonus programs 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue related to sales of our products  net of sales returns and allowances  provided that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments or when any such adjustments can be estimated 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine that appropriate credit limits are established prior to the acceptance of an order 
revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors  is reduced for estimated returns and distributor allowances 
we recognize revenue from sales of our products to distributors upon delivery of product to the distributors 
an allowance for distributor credits  covering price adjustments and scrap allowances  is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates as well as consideration of prevailing economic conditions and contractual terms 
to date  actual distributor claims activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our historical estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
we enter into development agreements with some of our customers and recognize revenue from these agreements upon completion and acceptance by the customer of contract deliverables  upon achievement of milestones or as services are provided  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
revenue is deferred for any amounts billed or received prior to completion of milestones or delivery of services 
as we retain the intellectual property generated from these development agreements  costs related to these arrangements are included in research and development expense 

table of contents we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenue from upfront payments for the licensing of our patents is recognized when the arrangement is mutually signed  if there is no future delivery or future performance obligation and all other criteria are met 
revenue from guaranteed royalty streams are recognized when paid  or collection is reasonably assured and all other criteria are met 
when patent licensing arrangements include royalties for future sales of the licensees products using our licensed patented technology  revenue is recognized when the royalty report is received from the licensee  at which time the sales price is fixed and determinable  provided that all other criteria have been met 
accounting for business combinations 
we use the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed measured at their fair values on the date acquired 
this requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values 
goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
while we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration  where applicable  our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement 
as a result  during the measurement period  which may be up to one year from the acquisition date  we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill 
upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed  whichever comes first  any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at the acquisition date  including our estimates for intangible assets  contractual obligations assumed  restructuring liabilities  pre acquisition contingencies and contingent consideration  where applicable 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based  in part  on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets we have acquired include  but are not limited to future expected cash flows from product sales  customer contracts and acquired technologies  expected costs to develop in process research and development into commercially viable products  estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets including business combinations related in process research and development  or ipr d  assets  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review of our long lived and intangible assets  include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and before interest from the use of the asset is less than the net book value of the asset 
the amount of the impairment loss will generally be measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset or asset group and its their estimated fair value 
we perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year  and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist  and we follow the two step approach in performing the impairment test in accordance with the accounting guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with the related carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  the reporting unit s goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the test must be performed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination  with the carrying amount of such goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we have one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing purposes which is based on the manner in which we operate our business and the nature of those operations  including consideration of how the chief operating decision maker  as defined in the accounting guidance on segment reporting  manages the business as a whole 
see note segment information we operate as one semiconductor company with sales of semiconductors representing the only material source of revenue 
substantially all products offered incorporate analog functionality and are manufactured under similar manufacturing processes 
for fiscal year  we used the quoted market price of our ordinary shares to determine the fair value of our reporting unit  which is the company as a whole 
no impairment of goodwill was identified based on the annual impairment review 
table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal year a decline in the quoted market prices of our ordinary shares would not impact the result of our goodwill impairment assessment 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of long lived assets under the accounting guidance on property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets such as ours  is also highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects about our business or the part of our business that the long lived asset relates to  consider market factors specific to the business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by the business  which requires significant judgment as it is based on assumptions about market demand for our products over a number of future years 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to take an impairment charge to reduce the value of the long lived asset stated on our consolidated balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors  such as the real estate market  industry and economic trends  and internal factors  such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
inventory valuation and warranty reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory  with cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our forecast of product demand and production requirements 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  which may cause us to understate or overstate both the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory and cost of products sold 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality control programs and processes  our warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  product recalls  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure  as well as possible claims for consequential costs 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required 
in that event  our gross margins would be reduced 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with the accounting guidance on income taxes 
the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for valuation allowances 
if we determine  in the future  that a valuation allowance is required  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase our tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
conversely  if we determine  in the future  a valuation allowance exceeds our requirement  such adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease tax expense in the period in which such determination is made 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold for recognition 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in singapore and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the actual amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would be required 
if the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist 
the gross unrecognized tax benefit increased by million during fiscal year to million as of november  from million as of october  the gross unrecognized tax benefit as of october  was million 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes line in the consolidated statements of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the other long term liabilities line in 
table of contents the consolidated balance sheets 
as of november   october   and october   the combined amount of cumulative accrued interest and penalties was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs over the employees average expected future service to the company  based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of gaap 
one critical assumption is the discount rate used to calculate the estimated costs 
other important assumptions include the expected long term return on plan assets  the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover  retiree mortality rates  and portfolio composition 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the relevant measurement dates november  and october   for both us and us plans  in fiscal years and  respectively 
for fiscal years and  the us discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a published pension discount curve 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
lower discount rates increase present values of pension liability and subsequent year pension expense  higher discount rates decrease present values of pension liability and subsequent year pension expense 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns 
plan assets are valued at fair value 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on plan assets for assumptions set in would result in an immaterial impact on non us pension expense for fiscal year we have no plan assets under our us plan 
the net periodic retirement and post retirement benefit costs recorded in consolidated statement of operations excluding curtailments and settlements were million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year share based compensation expense 
share based compensation expense consists of expense for stock options and restricted share units  or rsus  granted to both employees and non employees as well as expense associated with avago technologies limited employee share purchase plan  or espp 
we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method required under the authoritative guidance using black scholes valuation model with a straight line amortization method 
since the authoritative guidance requires that share based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  estimated share based compensation expense for such awards has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
changes in the estimated forfeiture rates can have a significant effect on share based compensation expense since the effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company began granting share price performance options  which are accounted for as market based stock options 
the fair value of these market based option awards is estimated on the date of grant using a monte carlo simulation model 
assumptions utilized in the monte carlo simulation model follow the same methodology as our time based option awards 
compensation expense for market based option awards is amortized based upon a graded vesting method and is recognized if the service period is met even if the market condition is not met the weighted average assumptions utilized for our black scholes valuation model for options and employee share purchase rights granted during the fiscal years ended november   october  and october  are as follows time based options market based options espp year ended year ended year ended november  october  october  november  november  october  october  risk free interest rate dividend yield volatility expected term in years the dividend yields for the years ended november   october  and october  are based on the historical and expected dividend payouts as of the respective option grant dates 
for the fiscal year ended november   expected volatility is based on the combination of historical volatility of guideline publicly traded companies and our own 
table of contents historical share price volatility over the period commensurate with the expected life of the awards and the implied volatility from traded options in guideline publicly traded companies and our own shares with a term of days or greater measured over the last three months 
effective for the first quarter of fiscal year we updated our guideline publicly traded companies based on direct competitors in our target markets 
prior to fiscal year  expected volatility was based on the combination of historical volatility of our previous group of guideline publicly traded companies over the period commensurate with the expected life of the options and the implied volatility of guideline publicly traded companies from traded options with a term of days or greater measured over the last three months 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury strips rate during the period  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant 
our computation of expected term was based on other data  such as the data of peer companies and company specific attributes that we believe could affect employees exercise behavior 
in fiscal year  we began to grant rsus  which are equity awards that are granted with an exercise price equal to zero and represent the right to receive one of our ordinary shares per rsu immediately upon vesting 
we recognize compensation expense for rsus using the straight line amortization method based on the fair value of rsus on the date of grant 
the fair value of rsus is the closing market price of our ordinary shares on the date of grant  which is equal to their intrinsic value on the date of grant 
we also record share based compensation expense based on an estimate of the fair value of rights to purchase ordinary shares under the espp and recognize this share based compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
employee bonus programs 
our employee bonus programs  which are overseen by our compensation committee  provide for variable compensation based on the attainment of overall corporate annual targets and functional performance metrics 
in the first fiscal quarter of the year  if management determines that it is probable that the targets and metrics will be achieved and the amounts can be reasonably estimated  a variable  proportional compensation accrual is recorded based on an assumed achievement of the targets and metrics 
the bonus payout levels can be greater if attainment of metrics and targets is greater than and a portion of the payouts may not occur if a minimum floor of performance is not achieved 
in subsequent quarters  we monitor and accrue for variable compensation expense based on our actual progress toward the achievement of the annual targets and metrics 
the actual achievement of target metrics at the end of the fiscal year  which is subject to approval by our compensation committee  may result in the actual variable compensation amounts being significantly higher or lower than the relevant estimated amounts accrued in earlier quarters  which would result in a corresponding adjustment in the fourth fiscal quarter 
fiscal year presentation we operate on a or week fiscal year which ends on the sunday closest to october fiscal year consisted of weeks  with the extra week falling in the first quarter of fiscal year each of fiscal years and consisted of weeks 
the financial statements included in this annual report on form k are presented in accordance with gaap and expressed in us dollars 

table of contents results from operations year ended november  compared to year ended october  the following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended november  and october  year ended november  october  november  october  in millions as a percentage of net revenue statement of operations data net revenue cost of products sold cost of products sold amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total cost of products sold gross margin research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges total operating expenses income from operations interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income net revenue 
net revenue was  million for fiscal year  compared to  million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the increase in net revenue was primarily due to strength in the wireless communications target market and in the wired infrastructure target market and due to continued revenue contribution from the cyoptics acquisition  partially offset by the transition from developing  manufacturing and selling our legacy consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing intellectual property relevant to these products in our industrial other target market 
further  fiscal year consisted of weeks compared to weeks in fiscal year our three target markets are wireless communications  wired infrastructure and industrial other 
the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in each of our target markets varies from fiscal quarter to quarter  due largely to fluctuations in end market demand  including the effects of seasonality 
the first fiscal quarter has historically been our lowest revenue and cash generating quarter due  in part  to holiday shut downs at many original equipment manufacturer  or oem  customers and distributors  and the first half of the fiscal year has tended to generate lower revenue than the second half of the fiscal year 
however  in recent periods typical seasonality and industry cyclicality have been increasingly overshadowed by other factors such as wider macroeconomic effects  the timing of significant product transitions and launches by large oems  particularly in the wireless communications target market  and new product launches by our competitors 
in fiscal year  strength in the smartphone market  particularly in the second half of the fiscal year  and strong sales to our two largest smartphone oems  as well as g long term evolution  or lte  product launches by other oems in our wireless target market contributed to the revenue increase from this market 
however  this increase was partially offset by a significant decrease in net revenue from our industrial other target market  primarily as a result of our transition from developing  manufacturing and selling consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing intellectual property relevant to these products 

table of contents historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue 
during the fiscal year ended november   foxconn technology group companies accounted for of our net revenue 
our top ten customers for fiscal year ended november   which included three distributors each  collectively accounted for of our net revenue 
we believe our aggregate sales to apple inc and cisco systems  inc  when direct sales are combined with indirect sales to them through the respective contract manufacturers that they utilize  each accounted for more than of our net revenues  for the fiscal year ended november  we expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods 
the loss of  or significant decrease in demand from  any of our top ten customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operation and financial condition 
net revenue by target market data is derived from our understanding of our end customers primary markets 
as discussed previously  effective fiscal year our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market will no longer be presented separately and has been included in our industrial other target market 
net revenue by target market was as follows year ended of net revenue november  october  change wireless communications wired infrastructure industrial other total net revenue year ended net revenue november  october  change in millions wireless communications wired infrastructure industrial other total net revenue net revenue from our wireless communications target market increased in fiscal year compared with the prior year due to continued strength in mobile smartphone sales 
unit sales of smartphones containing our products  as well as the amount of our product content in those phones is a key driver of our revenue from this target market 
new g lte product ramps at major smartphone oems and handset launches at other oems  as well as improvements in our content in those phones  also drove revenue growth during fiscal year as a result  we experienced higher demand for our power amplifiers and our film bulk acoustic resonator  or fbar  duplexers in fiscal year net revenue from our wired infrastructure target market increased in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year the increase in revenue from this target market in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily due to revenues resulting from our cyoptics acquisition and improvement in datacenter demand  partially offset by weak carrier routing spending 
net revenue from our industrial other target market decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to our transition from developing  manufacturing and selling our consumer and computing peripherals products to licensing intellectual property relevant to these products 
this decrease was partially offset by improved demand from our industrial distributors and oems  notably in transportation and power generation  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year however  demand in asia tapered off towards the end of fiscal year in fiscal year  we generated approximately million compared to million in fiscal year of intellectual property sales and licensing royalty revenue 
due to the structure of these licensing arrangements  royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
gross margin 
gross margin was  million for fiscal year compared to  million for fiscal year  an increase of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin was flat at for fiscal years and the increase in gross margin  in absolute dollars  in fiscal year was driven by increased sales  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from sales and licensing of intellectual property of million 
in addition  during fiscal year less favorable product mix  with a higher proportion of sales into our wireless communication target market  and the effects of lower margin cyoptics related revenue  also impacted gross margin compared to fiscal year 
table of contents research and development 
research and development expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses were for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the majority of this increase  in absolute dollars  resulted from investments in our wired infrastructure and wireless communications solutions 
part of the increase was attributable to a million increase in research and development project consumables and services 
the overall dollar increase in research and development expense was also attributable to a million increase in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program  which is a variable expense related to our achievement of program performance metrics  and annual merit based salary increases  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense  due to annual merit based salary increases and additional headcount costs from the cyoptics acquisition  a million increase in share based compensation expense attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant date fair values  a million increase in retention compensation expense primarily related to cyoptics acquisition  a million increase in computer software expenses and a million increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures supporting research and development efforts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in accrued reimbursements pursuant to research and development grants in fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for the fiscal year ended november  compared to million for the fiscal year ended october   an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expense increased slightly to for the fiscal year ended november  compared to for the fiscal year ended october  changes in components of selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year  consisted primarily of a million increase in share based compensation attributable to annual focal employee equity awards at higher grant date fair values  a million increase in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense related primarily to annual merit based salary increases  and partially offset by decreased overhead expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
total amortization expense of intangible assets incurred was million and million  respectively  for fiscal years and we anticipate our amortization expense will continue to be higher in future periods primarily as a result of a significant increase in amortizable intangible assets resulting from the cyoptics and javelin acquisitions 
restructuring charges 
we incurred total restructuring charges of million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  both predominantly representing employee termination costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year this million increase was due to commitment fees related to our revolving credit facility and amortization of related deferred debt issuance costs 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
in fiscal year  the termination of the credit facility resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million related to the write off of debt amortization costs and other related expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net includes net realized gains on the sale of available for sales securities  realized and unrealized gains on trading securities  gains on the sale of cost method investments  interest income  currency gains losses on balance sheet remeasurement  and other miscellaneous items 
other income  net was million for fiscal year compared to other income  net of million for fiscal year this increase in other income  net for fiscal year is primarily attributable to realized gains on the sale of available for sale and trading securities and unrealized gains on trading securities

net revenue was  million for fiscal year  compared to  million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
the slight increase in net revenue was primarily due to strength in our wireless communications target market  largely offset by weakness in our industrial target market 
net revenue from our consumer and computing peripherals target market remained relatively flat compared to fiscal year  benefiting from the last time purchases of product due to our transition from manufacturing and sales of products to an intellectual property licensing and royalty business model in this target market 
this transition was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year until august  we also manufactured products for the consumer and computing peripherals target market  including motion control encoders that control the paper feed and print head movement in printers and other office automation products and image sensors for optical mouse applications  using leds and cmos image sensors to create a subsystem that can detect motion over an arbitrary desktop surface 
during fiscal year  we transitioned from manufacturing and selling these products to selling or licensing our intellectual property relevant to this target market  thereby generating royalty revenue instead of product sales

we experienced higher demand for our multi mode  multi band power amplifiers  in particular  as well as for our fbar duplexers in fiscal year demand for fbar duplexers in fiscal year also benefited from transitions by various cellular carriers to the g lte standard 
net revenue from our wired infrastructure target market remained relatively flat in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year during fiscal year  we saw strong growth from sales of our asics used in data center applications compared to fiscal year revenues from this target market for fiscal year also reflect an increase in development agreement and intellectual property licensing revenue of million 
however for fiscal year  these effects were substantially offset by a decrease in high performance computing hardware sales  as well as a pullback in sales of proprietary parallel optics at several of our large communications oem customers due to weak core routing spending with service providers 
net revenue from our industrial and automotive electronics target market decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this decrease was due primarily to continued  and worse than expected  supply chain corrections and weakness in industrial spending  in china in particular  in fiscal year compared with fiscal year these effects were partially offset by increases in revenue from development agreements and the sale of certain of our intellectual property of approximately million  for fiscal year net revenue from our legacy consumer and computing peripherals target market increase slightly in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this was largely due to the last time purchases of product in the third quarter of fiscal year  resulting from our transition from manufacturing and sales of products to an intellectual property licensing and royalty business model in this target market 
the transition to the intellectual property licensing royalty model was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the fiscal year  we generated approximately million in intellectual property related revenue from this target market 
due to the structure of these licensing arrangements  royalty revenue may fluctuate from period to period 
gross margin 
gross margin was  million for fiscal year compared to  million for fiscal year  a decrease of million 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin decreased slightly to for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year the slight decrease in gross margin in fiscal year was driven by product mix  with a higher proportion of sales into our wireless communication target market compared to sales into our higher margin industrial and automotive electronics target market 
this mix effect was substantially offset by i an increase in revenue from development agreements and sales and licensing of intellectual property of million in fiscal year  ii a million decrease in cost of products sold due to a revision in wafer cost allocation methodology during fiscal year  and iii a million decrease in depreciation expense during the fiscal year  resulting from a change in the duration of the useful lives of certain of our manufacturing equipment which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year during the fiscal quarter ended january  
table of contents  we revised our cost allocation methodology to fully burden with overhead costs the expense for wafers used in research and development projects that are processed through our internal fabrication facilities  or r d wafer cost allocation methodology 
research and development 
research and development expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses remained flat at for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year the majority of this increase  in absolute dollars  resulted from investments in our wired infrastructure and wireless communications solutions 
part of the increase was attributable to a million increase in research and development project consumables and services  million of which was due to the change in r d wafer cost allocation methodology  as discussed above under gross margin  which increased gross margin by a corresponding amount 
the overall dollar increase in research and development expense was also attributable to an million increase in depreciation expense related to capital expenditures supporting research and development efforts  a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense  and a million increase in share based compensation expense attributable to grants of share based awards at higher fair market values and to our espp 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our employee bonus program  which is a variable expense related to our achievement of program performance metrics  and a million decrease in computer software expenses in fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year the overall dollar increase in research and development expense is also net of million in accrued reimbursements pursuant to research and development grants 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  due to the increasing complexity and number of products we plan to develop 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense was million for the year ended october  compared to million for the year ended october   a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased slightly to for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  changes in components of selling  general and administrative expense for the fiscal year  compared to the fiscal year  consisted of a million decrease in legal expenses related to offensive litigation matters  a million decrease in accrued incentive compensation expense related to our performance based employee bonus program  a million decrease in external services related to consulting and it  a million decrease in depreciation expense  and a million decrease in salaries and wages expense  partially offset by a million increase in share based compensation expense attributable to grants of share based awards at higher fair market values and to our espp 
amortization of intangible assets

we incurred total restructuring charges of million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  both predominantly representing employee termination costs 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year  which represents a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily due to the redemption of the remaining million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated rate notes on december  loss on extinguishment of debt 
during fiscal year  we redeemed million aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
the redemption of the senior subordinated notes resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million 
during fiscal year  we also terminated our senior secured revolving credit facility 
there were no outstanding loan borrowings under this facility at the time of termination 
this termination resulted in a loss on extinguishment of debt of million  related to the write off of debt amortization costs and other related expenses

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following section discusses our principal liquidity and capital resources as well as our principal liquidity requirements and sources and uses of cash 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of days or less at the time of purchase 
we believe our cash equivalents are liquid and accessible 
the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held in financial institutions in singapore 
our primary sources of liquidity as at november  consisted of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  cash we expect to generate from operations and our new million unsecured  revolving credit facility  which is committed until october   all of which is available to be drawn 
our short term and long term liquidity requirements primarily arise from i working capital requirements  ii research and development and capital expenditure needs  including acquisitions from time to time and iii quarterly dividend payments if and when declared by our board and any share repurchases we may choose to make under our share repurchase program 
our ability to fund these requirements will depend on our future cash flows  which are determined by future operating performance and are  therefore  subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
on april   our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its ordinary shares  referred to as the share repurchase program 
prior to the expiration of the share repurchase program on april   during fiscal year the company repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash under the share repurchase program 
on april   our board authorized the company to repurchase up to million of its ordinary shares in open market transactions  referred to as the share repurchase program  to replace the expired share repurchase program 
the share repurchase program will expire the day prior to the company agm  unless earlier terminated 
during fiscal year  the company repurchased and retired an aggregate of million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash under the share repurchase program 
share repurchases under our share repurchase programs are made in the open market at such times and in such amounts as the company deems appropriate 
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased depend on a variety of factors including price  market conditions and applicable legal requirements 
the share repurchase program does not obligate the company to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice 
our cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at november  from  million at october  primarily as a result of an aggregate of million in cash paid for business acquisitions completed during fiscal year  million in cash paid for equity investments  million in cash paid for capital expenditures  million in cash paid to repurchase million of our ordinary shares  and million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders 
partially offsetting the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was million in cash provided by operating activities  million in cash received from the issuance of ordinary shares pursuant to the exercise of options under our employee share option plans and purchase rights under our employee share purchase plan  million in cash received from the sale of equity investments and million in cash received from government grants 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our unsecured  revolving credit facility  will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations  projected working capital requirements  capital spending  quarterly cash dividends if and when declared by our board and any share repurchases we may choose to make under our share repurchase program for at least the next months 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for fiscal year may be higher than for fiscal year  due primarily to continued spending related to ongoing capacity expansion in our fort collins internal fabrication facility  as well as spending on equipment to support various research and development projects 
from time to time  we engage in discussions with third parties regarding potential acquisitions of  or investments in  businesses  technologies and product lines  such as our recent acquisitions of cyoptics and javelin 
any such transaction could require significant use of our cash and cash equivalents  or require us to issue debt or equity securities  or borrow under our revolving credit facility to fund the transaction 
if we do not have sufficient cash to fund our operations or to finance growth opportunities  including acquisitions  or unanticipated capital expenditures  our business and financial condition could suffer 
we could also reduce certain expenditures such as repurchases of our ordinary shares and payment of our quarterly cash dividend 
in such circumstances we may seek to obtain debt or equity financing in the future 
however  we cannot assure that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our ability to service any indebtedness we may incur  including under our unsecured  revolving credit facility  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional debt or equity securities or increase our current credit facility for other reasons 

table of contents the aggregate acquisition consideration payable in our recently announced transaction to acquire lsi is approximately billion in cash 
in connection with our entry into the merger agreement relating to that transaction  we also entered into a note purchase agreement with an affiliate of silver lake partners  or slp  to purchase billion aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes  or convertible notes 
the completion of the private placement of the convertible notes is contingent on satisfaction or waiver of customary conditions  as well as a requirement that that the merger with lsi shall have been consummated or shall be consummated substantially 
the initial conversion rate for the convertible notes is shares of avago ordinary shares per  principal amount of convertible notes  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per ordinary share 
the balance of the acquisition consideration payable by us in connection with the merger agreement is expected to be provided by approximately billion of cash on hand of the combined company and a billion term loan 
the term loan is expected to be entered into by a newly formed avago subsidiary  or borrower  and will be guaranteed by certain of our other subsidiaries and secured by  subject to certain exceptions  all of the assets of such other subsidiaries and of the borrower 
we have received commitments from a group of banks to provide us with the billion term loan  as well as a million secured  revolving credit facility that would replace our current unsecured revolving credit facility

table of contents indemnifications to hewlett packard and agilent agilent technologies  inc has given multiple indemnities to hewlett packard company in connection with its activities prior to its spin off from hewlett packard company in june for the businesses that constituted agilent prior to the spin off 
as the successor to the spg business of agilent  we may acquire responsibility for indemnifications related to assigned intellectual property agreements 
additionally  when we completed the spg acquisition in december  we provided indemnities to agilent with regard to agilent s conduct of the spg business prior to the spg acquisition 
in our opinion  the fair value of these indemnifications is not material and no amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations 
other indemnifications as is customary in our industry and as provided for in local law in the united states and other jurisdictions  many of our standard contracts provide remedies to our customers and others with whom we enter into contracts  such as defense  settlement  or payment of judgment for intellectual property claims related to the use of our products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency derivative instruments although a majority of our revenue and operating expenses is denominated in us dollars  and we prepare our financial statements in us dollars in accordance with gaap  a portion of our revenue and operating expenses is in foreign currencies 
our revenues  costs and expenses and monetary assets and liabilities are exposed to changes in currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
to mitigate the exposures resulting from the changes in the exchange rates of these currencies  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of these exposures 
contracts that meet accounting criteria are designated at inception as hedges of the related foreign currency exposures  which include committed and anticipated transactions that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the criteria for designating a derivative as a hedge include the assessment of the instrument s effectiveness in risk reduction  matching of the derivative instrument to its underlying transaction  and the assessment of the probability that the underlying transaction will occur 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally mature within three to six months 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes
