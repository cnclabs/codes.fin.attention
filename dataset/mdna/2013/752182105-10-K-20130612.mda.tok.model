item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations all dollar amounts are presented in millions except share  per share and per day amounts 
the following management discussion and analysis md a is written to help the reader understand our company 
the md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying financial statement notes of the company appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  overview business rand formerly rand acquisition corporation was incorporated in the state of delaware in as a blank check company 
in  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of lower lakes towing and its affiliate  grand river 
subsequent to the acquisition of lower lakes towing and grand river  we have added ten vessels to our fleet through acquisition transactions  including the acquisitions of three self unloading articulated tug and barge units and two bulk carriers 
we have also retired two smaller vessels 
our shipping business is operated in canada by lower lakes towing and in the united states by lower lakes transportation 
lower lakes towing was organized in march under the laws of canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the great lakes and has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full service shipping company with a fleet of sixteen cargo carrying vessels 
we have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the great lakes and the leading service provider in the river class market segment  which we define as vessels less than feet in overall length 
we transport construction aggregates  coal  iron ore  salt  grain and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction  electric utility  integrated steel and food industries 
we believe that lower lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port to port services to both canada and the united states in the great lakes region 
lower lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both us and canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the shipping act   and the merchant marine act   commonly referred to as the jones act in the us and the coasting trade act in canada

according to the lake carriers association  which we refer to as the lca  during the sailing season  us flagged vessels industry wide experienced a decrease in overall customer demand for the commodities that we carry on the great lakes compared to the sailing season 
other than aggregates  for which us flagged shipments increased  overall industry tonnage decreased for all of the major commodities that we carried on the great lakes during the sailing season compared to the sailing season 
freight and other related revenue generated from company operated vessels increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  excluding the impact of currency changes  freight revenue increased during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  tonnage hauled by our operated vessels for the fiscal year ended march  increased compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase in revenue was attributable to contractual price increases and net additional sailing days 
of these additional sailing days  only sailing days out of a potential sailing days were gained from two of the three vessels acquired in the fiscal year ended march  one of these vessels was delayed in being put into service until october  versus our projected introduction date of august  due to modifications to such vessel taking longer than anticipated 
the second of the two acquired vessels was impacted by a poor grain market earlier in the year sailing days lost and an early layup for further modifications at the end of the year sailing days lost 
the third vessel sailed days more than in the prior year 
the increase in freight and other related revenue for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  was muted because the benefits from the acquisition of our three new vessels were partially offset by two vessel incidents that i reduced sailing days from the directly affected vessels and ii impacted the trade patterns on our other vessels 
furthermore  our vessels sailed fewer days in the three month period ended march  as compared to the three month period ended march  due to an earlier onset of winter weather as compared to the prior year 
we operated sixteen vessels during the fiscal year ended march   including the three vessels acquired during the fiscal year ended march   compared to fourteen vessels operated during the fiscal year ended march  however  one of the aforementioned vessels however only began sailing on october  management believes that each of our vessels should achieve a theoretical maximum sailing days april through december  assuming no major repairs  incidents or vessel layups and normal drydocking cycle times performed during the winter lay up period 
the company s vessels sailed an average of approximately sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to an average of sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  the average number of sailing days per vessel during the fiscal year ended march  was adversely impacted by the following events that we consider non recurring sailing days lost as a result of the loss of sailing days due to mechanical repairs on two vessels following incidents that occurred during the sailing season  sailing days lost related to a bulker that was taken out of service on december  for further modifications sailing days lost  and sailing days lost related to the articulated tug barge which was introduced into service on october  and only sailed days during such period 
freight and related revenue per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was somewhat offset by a slightly weaker canadian dollar and an approximately decrease in salt tonnage hauled for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  the reduction in our salt tonnage carried was due to an abnormally dry winter during the fiscal year ended march  in the great lakes region 
finally  we experienced erratic customer demand throughout the fiscal year ended march   which impacted the efficiency of our delivery patterns 
all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby changes in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers 
such increases and decreases in fuel surcharges impact margin percentages  but do not significantly impact our margin dollars 
fuel and other surcharges decreased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was attributable to reduced fuel prices and a weaker canadian dollar  offset by an increased number of sailing days 
fuel and other surcharges per sailing day decreased by  or  to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to a greater number of sailing days attributable to three additional vessels acquired in the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses were adversely impacted by associated start up and incremental operating costs related to the three vessels we acquired during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses were partially offset by a slightly weaker canadian dollar  reduced fuel pricing and reduced operating expenses due to vessel repairs 
vessel operating expenses per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance expenses  which primarily consist of expensed winter work  increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  primarily due to the two acquired vessels which first sailed in fiscal repairs and maintenance per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to the combined impact of the delays in completing winter work at the start of the sailing season  the normal winter work done during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  and the associated impact of fewer sailing days for two of the three recently acquired vessels 
our general and administrative expenses were million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million or 
these costs increased due to higher legal and consulting costs  financing amendment fees related to our credit agreements and increased compensation and benefit costs related in part to higher engineering and it headcount 
our general and administrative expenses represented of freight revenues during the fiscal year ended march  and during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our operating companies 
depreciation expense increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the increase in depreciation expense was primarily attributable to two bulkers and the articulated tug barge unit acquired during the fiscal year ended march  that we sailed during the fiscal year ended march   winter capital expenditures and the repowering of one vessel that was completed in june  offset by a weaker canadian dollar during the fiscal year ended march  amortization of drydock costs increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company amortized the deferred drydock costs of twelve of its sixteen operated vessels  compared to nine vessels during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the items described above  during the fiscal year ended march   the company s operating income decreased million to million compared to operating income of million during the fiscal year ended march  operating income plus depreciation  amortization of drydock costs and amortization of intangibles decreased  or million  to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense increased million to million during the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  this increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to higher average debt balances due to the cdn million increase in the canadian term loan in july  the million increase in the us term loan on december   the million net increase in us term loan on august  and higher average revolver balance 
as a result of the third amended and restated credit agreement discussed below  we recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of million during the fiscal year ended march   which comprised the unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with our previously existing financing arrangements 
we recorded a gain on interest rate swap contracts of million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to a gain of million during the fiscal year ended march  such gains were due to the recording of the fair value of our two interest rate swaps at the end of each such period 
the contracts for these two interest swaps expired march  our loss before income taxes was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to income before income taxes of million during the fiscal year ended march  our effective tax rate was on a pre tax loss for the fiscal year ended march  compared to on pre tax income for the fiscal year ended march  our provision for income tax was a benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march  compared to a tax benefit of million for the fiscal year ended march  in addition to pre tax earnings variances  the decrease in income tax benefit was due to a foreign statutory rate change as applied to the foreign net deferred tax liabilities in the fiscal year ended march  and the absence of a tax benefit from a change in valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended march  as compared to the fiscal year ended march  the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  is lower than the statutory tax rate due to permanent differences  primarily imputed interest  and the change in the foreign statutory rate as applied to the foreign net deferred tax liabilities 
the effective rate for the fiscal year ended march  was lower than the statutory rate due to the tax benefit associated with the full reversal of the valuation allowance totaling million 
our net loss before preferred stock dividends was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to our net income of million during the fiscal year ended march  we accrued million for dividends on our preferred stock during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  the dividends accrued at a rate of during the fiscal year ended march  compared to an average rate of during the fiscal year ended march  the dividend rate increased to a cap of effective july  our net loss applicable to common stockholders was million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to net income of million during the fiscal year ended march  the canadian dollar weakened by compared to the us dollar  averaging approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  compared to approximately usd per cdn during the fiscal year ended march  the company balance sheet translation rate decreased from usd per cdn at march  to usd per cdn at march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company operated an average of seven vessels in the us and nine vessels in canada 
the percentage of our total freight and other revenue  fuel and other surcharge revenue  vessel operating expenses  repairs and maintenance costs and combined depreciation and amortization costs approximate the percentage of vessels operated by country 
our outside voyage charter revenue and costs relate solely to our canadian subsidiary and approximately half of our general and administrative costs are incurred in canada 
nearly half of our interest expense is incurred in canada 
all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us

other than coal  for which us flagged shipments decreased by  overall industry tonnage increased for all of the major commodities during the sailing season compared to the sailing season 
freight and other related revenue generated from company operated vessels increased million  or  to million during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million during the fiscal year ended march  excluding the impact of currency changes  freight revenue increased during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  this increase was attributable to additional sailing days resulting in an increase in tonnage hauled by our operated vessels and contractual price increases 
we operated fourteen vessels during the fiscal year ended march   including the two vessels acquired in february and the vessel acquired in july  compared to twelve vessels during the fiscal year ended march  the company did not sail the two vessels acquired in the third quarter of the fiscal year ended march the company vessels sailed an average of approximately sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  compared to sailing days during the fiscal year ended march  freight and related revenue per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  compared to  per sailing day during the fiscal year ended march  this increase was somewhat offset by inefficiencies experienced earlier in the year in matching fleet configuration with customer requirements  delays in completing required winter work which delays caused us to begin the sailing season later than our typical april start date and one of our vessels being out of service for days due to its repowering 
all of our customer contracts have fuel surcharge provisions whereby increases and decreases in our fuel costs are passed on to our customers 
such increases and decreases in fuel surcharges impact margin percentages  but do not significantly impact our margin dollars

vessel operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily attributable to higher fuel costs  an increased number of sailing days  two additional vessels acquired in february  one additional vessel acquired in july and a stronger canadian dollar  partially offset by a reduction of costs due to the long term lay up of one of our vessels during the fiscal year ended march  vessel operating expenses per sailing day increased  or  to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance expenses  which primarily consist of expensed winter work  increased million to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million during the fiscal year ended march  repairs and maintenance per sailing day increased to  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  from  per sailing day in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was primarily due to the combined impact of the delays in completing winter work at the start of the sailing season and the normal winter work done during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses increased million to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase was a result of higher compensation costs  million attributable to bank administrative fees due under the black creek loan  million of audit costs associated with the implementation of compliance with section b of the sarbanes oxley act and the stronger canadian dollar in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  our general and administrative expenses represented of freight revenues during the fiscal year ended march   a decrease from of freight revenues during the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   million of our general and administrative expenses was attributable to our parent company and million was attributable to our operating companies

our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended march  was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the tax benefit associated with the reversal of the valuation allowance related to the net us federal deferred tax assets against current income before taxes 
the federal valuation allowance was reversed based on our improved profitability

all of our preferred stock dividends are accrued in the us 
impact of inflation and changing prices during the fiscal years ended march   and  there were major fluctuations in our fuel costs 
however  our contracts with our customers provide for recovery of these costs over specified rates through fuel surcharges 
in addition  there was volatility in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during the past three fiscal years  which impacted our translation of total revenue and costs to us dollars by a decrease of approximately during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  and an increase of during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations  the proceeds of our credit facility and proceeds from sales of our common stock 
our principal uses of cash are vessel acquisitions  capital expenditures  drydock expenditures  operations and interest and principal payments under our credit facility 
information on our consolidated cash flow is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows categorized by operating  investing and financing activities which is included in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  the company makes seasonal net borrowings under its revolving credit facility during the first quarter of each fiscal year to fund working capital needed to commence the sailing season 
such borrowings are then reduced during the second half of each fiscal year 
we believe cash generated from our operations and availability of borrowings under our credit facilities will provide sufficient cash availability to cover our anticipated working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if the company experiences a material shortfall to its financial forecasts or if the company customers materially delay their receivable payments due to further deterioration of economic conditions  the company may breach its financial covenants and collateral thresholds and be strained for liquidity 
the company has maintained its focus on productivity gains and cost controls  and is closely monitoring customer credit and accounts receivable balances 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net cash provided was primarily due to lower deferred drydock costs paid in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended march  was million  an increase of million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  this increase in net cash provided was primarily due to higher cash earnings  offset in part by substantially higher deferred drydock costs paid in the fiscal year ended march  the company did not incur any significant bad debt write offs or material slowdowns in receivable collections during the fiscal years ended march   or the timing of the end of the company fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of a sailing season receivables to be collected prior to the end of the company fiscal year 
in addition  the earlier start of a sailing season prior to april  can increase the amount of accounts receivable and accounts payable in the company balance sheet at the end of our fiscal year 
net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was due primarily to the costs of upgrading acquired vessels being lower than the costs to acquire such vessels in the fiscal year ended march  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  from net cash used of million during the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was due primarily to the purchase of three vessels during the fiscal year ended march  at a lower combined acquisition cost than the vessels acquired in the fiscal year ended march   offset by higher capital spending primarily attributable to upgrades to the vessels we acquired in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided in financing activities decreased million to million provided during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million provided in the fiscal year ended march  net cash provided in financing activities decreased million to million provided during the fiscal year ended march  compared to million provided in the fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   the company received debt proceeds of million  revolver debt proceeds of million  and made principal payments on its term debt of million

on july   lower lakes acquired a canadian flagged dry bulk carrier for cdn million with borrowings under its canadian term loan 
on september   lower lakes towing and grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement with usuos pursuant to which lower lakes towing agreed to purchase a bulk carrier from usuos for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard such bulk carrier at the closing of the acquisition 
we completed the acquisition of such bulk carrier on october  we used a portion of the net proceeds from the equity offering described above under liquidity and capital resources to fund deferred drydock costs and improvements to such bulk carrier 
also on september   grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement the tug agreement with usuos pursuant to which grand river purchased a tug the tug from usuos for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard the tug at the closing of the acquisition 
we completed the acquisition of the tug on december  additionally  on september   grand river entered into an asset purchase agreement the barge agreement with usuos pursuant to which usuos granted grand river the option to act as usuos third party designee to purchase a self unloading barge the barge for a purchase price of million plus the value of the remaining bunkers and unused lubricating oils onboard the barge at the closing of the acquisition

contractual commitments the following table summarizes the company contractual obligations for the next five years and thereafter as of march  payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations bareboat charter agreement total foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign currency exposure related to the currency related translation of various financial instruments denominated in the canadian dollar fair value risk and operating cash flows denominated in the canadian dollar cash flow risk 
these exposures are associated with period to period changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
at march   our liability for financial instruments with exposure to foreign currency risk was approximately cdn million of term borrowings and cdn million of revolving borrowings in canada 
although we have tried to match our indebtedness and cash flows from earnings by country  a sudden increase in the canadian dollar exchange rates could increase the indebtedness converted to us dollars before operating cash flows can make up for such a currency conversion change 
from a cash flow perspective  our operations are insulated against changes in currency rates as operations in canada and the united states have revenues and expenditures denominated in local currencies and our operations are cash flow positive 
however  as stated above  a significant portion of our financial liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars  exposing us to currency risks related to principal payments and interest payments on such financial liability instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates associated with our banking facilities and senior debt bearing variable interest rates under our third amended and restated credit agreement  which carries interest rates which vary with canadian prime rates and ba rates for canadian borrowings  and us prime rates and libor rates on us borrowings 
in december  the company entered into two interest rate cap contracts through december  covering of its outstanding term debt at a cap of three month libor at on of its us term debt borrowings and three month ba rates at on of its canadian term debt borrowings 
the notional amount on each of these instruments will decrease with each scheduled principal payment 
off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
lack of historical operating data for acquired vessels from time to time  as opportunities arise and depending on the availability of financing  we may acquire additional secondhand drybulk carriers 
consistent with shipping industry practice  other than inspection of the physical condition of the vessels and examinations of classification society records  there is typically no historical financial due diligence process conducted when we acquire vessels 
accordingly  in such circumstances  we do not obtain the historical operating data for the vessels from the sellers because that information is not material to our decision to make vessel acquisitions  nor do we believe it would be helpful to potential investors in our stock in assessing our business or profitability 
consistent with shipping industry practice  we generally treat the acquisition of a vessel as the acquisition of an asset rather than a business 
in cases where a vessel services a contract of affreightment with a third party customer and the buyer desires to acquire such contract  the seller generally cannot transfer the contract to the buyer without the customer consent 
the purchase of a vessel itself typically does not transfer the contracts of affreightment serviced by such vessel because such contracts are separate service agreements between the vessel owner and its customers 
where we identify any intangible assets or liabilities associated with the acquisition of a vessel  we allocate the purchase price of acquired tangible and intangible assets based on their relative fair values 
when we purchase a vessel and assume or renegotiate contracts of affreightment associated with the vessel  we must take the following steps before the vessel will be ready to commence operations obtain the customer consent to us as the new owner if applicable  arrange for a new crew for the vessel  replace all hired equipment on board  such as gas cylinders and communication equipment  negotiate and enter into new insurance contracts for the vessel through our own insurance brokers  and implement a new planned maintenance program for the vessel 
the following discussion is intended to provide an understanding of how acquisitions of vessels affect our business and results of operations 
our business is comprised of the following main elements employment and operation of our drybulk vessels  scheduling our vessels to satisfy customer contracts of affreightment  and management of the financial  general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our drybulk vessels 
the employment and operation of our vessels requires the following main components vessel maintenance and repair  crew selection and training  vessel spares and stores supply  planning and undergoing drydocking  special surveys and other major repairs  organizing and undergoing regular classification society surveys  contingency response planning  onboard safety procedures auditing  accounting  vessel insurance arrangement  vessel scheduling  vessel security training and security response plans isps  obtain ism certification and audit for each vessel within six months of taking over a vessel  vessel hire management  vessel surveying  and vessel performance monitoring 
the management of financial  general and administrative elements involved in the conduct of our business and ownership of our vessels requires the following main components management of our financial resources  including banking relationships eg  administration of bank loans  management of our accounting system and records and financial reporting  administration of the legal and regulatory requirements affecting our business and assets  and management of the relationships with our service providers and customers 
the principal factors that affect our profitability  cash flows and stockholders return on investment include rates of contracts of affreightment and charterhire  scheduling to match vessels with customer requirements  including dock limitation  vessel trade patterns and backhaul opportunities  weather conditions  vessel incidents  levels of vessel operating expenses  depreciation and amortization expenses  financing costs  and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
critical accounting policies rand significant accounting policies are presented in note to its audited consolidated financial statements  and the following summaries should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
while all accounting policies affect the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
revenue and operating expenses recognition the company generates revenues from freight billings under contracts of affreightment voyage charters generally on a rate per ton basis based on origin destination and cargo carried 
voyage revenue is recognized ratably over the duration of a voyage based on the relative transit time in each reporting period when the following conditions are met the company has a signed contract of affreightment  the contract price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
included in freight billings are other fees such as fuel surcharges and other freight surcharges  which represent pass through charges to customers for toll fees  lockage fees and ice breaking fees paid to other parties 
fuel surcharges are recognized ratably over the duration of the voyage  while freight surcharges are recognized when the associated costs are incurred 
freight surcharges are less than of total revenue 
marine operating expenses such as crewing costs  fuel  tugs and insurance are recognized as incurred or consumed and thereby are recognized ratably in each reporting period 
repairs and maintenance and certain other insignificant costs are recognized as incurred 
the company subcontracts excess customer demand to other freight providers 
service to customers under such arrangements is transparent to the customer and no additional services are provided to customers 
consequently  revenues recognized for customers serviced by freight subcontractors are recognized on the same basis as described above 
costs for subcontracted freight providers  presented as outside voyage charter fees in the consolidated statements of operations  are recognized as incurred and therefore are recognized ratably over the voyage 
the company accounts for sales taxes imposed on its services on a net basis in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  all revenues are presented on a gross basis 
vessel acquisitions vessels are stated at cost  which consists of the purchase price and any material expenses incurred upon acquisition  such as initial repairs  improvements  delivery expenses and other expenditures to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage 
subsequent expenditures for conversions and major improvements are also capitalized when they appreciably extend the life  increase the earnings capacity or improve the efficiency or safety of the vessels 
significant financing costs incurred during the construction period of the vessels are also capitalized and included in the vessels cost 
otherwise these amounts are charged to expense as incurred 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  financing costs  trademarks  trade names and customer relationships and contracts 
intangible assets are amortized as follows trademarks and trade names years straight line customer relationships and contracts years straight line deferred financing costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related debt  which approximates the effective interest method 
impairment of fixed assets fixed assets eg property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets eg customer lists are tested for impairment upon the occurrence of a triggering event that indicates the carrying value of such an asset or asset groups eg tugs and barges  might be no longer recoverable 
examples of such triggering events include a significant disposal of a portion of such assets  an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related asset s  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from an acquired business  difficulties or delays in integrating the business  and a significant change in the operations of an acquired business 
once a triggering event has occurred  the recoverability test employed is based on whether the intent is to hold the asset s for continued use or to hold the asset s for sale 
if the intent is to hold the asset for continued use  the recoverability test involves a comparison of undiscounted cash flows excluding interest expense  against the carrying value of the asset s as an initial test 
if the carrying value of such asset s exceeds the undiscounted cash flow  the asset s would be deemed to be impaired 
impairment would then be measured as the difference between the fair value of the fixed or amortizing intangible asset and the carrying value of such asset s 
the company generally determines fair value by using the discounted cash flow method 
if the intent is to hold the asset s for sale and certain other criteria are met ie  the asset s can be disposed of currently  appropriate levels of authority have approved the sale and there is an actively pursuing buyer  the impairment test is a comparison of the asset carrying value to its fair value less costs to sell 
to the extent that the carrying value is greater than the asset fair value less costs to sell  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the twelve month period ended march  impairment of goodwill the company annually reviews the carrying value of goodwill to determine whether impairment may exist 
accounting standards codification asc intangibles goodwill and other and accounting standards update asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which was adopted march   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed annually for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a three step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the reporting unit when testing goodwill for impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is determined  based on qualitative factors  to be more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then entities are required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of the company two reporting units  which are the company canadian and us operations excluding the parent  are determined using various valuation techniques with the primary techniques being a discounted cash flow analysis and peer analysis 
a discounted cash flow analysis requires various judgmental assumptions  including assumptions about future cash flows  growth rates  and discount rates 
the assumptions about future cash flows and growth rates are based on the company forecast and long term estimates 
discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the risk inherent in the respective reporting units 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the third step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
as of march   the company conducted the qualitative assessment and determined that the fair value of its two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts and the remaining two step impairment testing was therefore not necessary 
the company has determined that there were no adverse changes in our markets or other triggering events that could affect the valuation of our assets during the twelve month period ended march  income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes  which requires the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recognized  if necessary  to measure tax benefits to the extent that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
the company adopted accounting guidance surrounding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january   which had no impact on the company consolidated financial statements because management concluded that the tax benefits related to the company uncertain tax positions can be fully recognized 
the company classifies interest expense related to income tax liabilities  when applicable  as part of the interest expense in its consolidated statements of operations rather than income tax expense 
to date  the company has not incurred material interest expenses or penalties relating to assessed taxation amounts 
there have been no recent examinations by the us taxing authorities 
the company was examined by the canadian taxing authority for the tax years and and such examination is now complete

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our primary market risk is the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our variable rate borrowings 
excluding the interest rate cap agreements discussed below  as of march   approximately million of our long term debt bore interest at interest rates ranging from to 
based on our total outstanding floating rate debt as of march  and subject to the interest rate cap agreements discussed below  the impact of a change in interest rates would result in a change in interest expense  and a corresponding impact on income before income taxes  of approximately million annually on the company us term debt borrowings and approximately million annually on the company canadian term debt borrowings 
as of march   the company had two outstanding interest rate cap agreements covering of its outstanding term debt at a cap of three month libor at on of its us term debt borrowings and three month ba rates at on of its canadian term debt borrowings 
the notional amount on each of these instruments will decrease with each scheduled principal payment 
as of march   we were paying a weighted average fixed rate of including applicable margins 
the primary objective of these contracts is to reduce the aggregate risk of higher interest costs associated with variable rate debt 
we are exposed to credit related losses in the event of non performance by counterparties to these instruments  however  the counterparties are major financial institutions and we consider such risk of loss to be minimal 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
fuel price risk we partially mitigate our direct fuel price risk through fuel price escalation clauses  which are included in substantially all of lower lakes contracts of affreightment and which enable lower lakes to pass the majority of its increased fuel costs on to its customers 
additionally  fuel costs are only one element of the potential movement in spot market pricing  which generally respond only to long term changes in fuel pricing 
we also believe that fuel is a significant element of the economic model of our vendors on the great lakes  with increases passed through to us in the form of higher costs for external shifting and towing
