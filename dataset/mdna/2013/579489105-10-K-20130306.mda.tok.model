in connection with the sale  the miami herald media company entered into a lease agreement with the buyer pursuant to which we have continued to operate our miami newspaper operations rent free from the existing location through may  while our new facilities are being constructed 
we must vacate the facilities by the end of may as a result of our continuing involvement in the property and given the fact that we will not pay rent during this period  the sale was treated as a financing transaction 
accordingly  we will continue to depreciate the carrying value of the building until our operations are moved 
in addition  we have recorded a million liability in financing obligations equal to the sales proceeds received of million plus the million received from the escrow account for reimbursement of moving expenses 
we are imputing rent based on comparable market rates  which will be reflected as interest expense until the operations are moved

we estimate that purchases of property  plant and equipment pp e in fiscal year will be approximately million with approximately million of the amount going towards final costs of the new miami production facility

table of contents difference in contributions to our plan  as discussed below  and a decrease of accrued interest of approximately million related to the retirement of notes 
the decrease in cash from continuing operating activities in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily related to the use of cash for the following operational purposes in contribution to our plan see discussion of pension contributions resulting from the miami property sale below  payment of interest on the notes  which were issued in february but had only one semi annual interest payment in fiscal year  payment of supplemental contributions accrued throughout fiscal year but payable to our k plan in fiscal year  payment of fiscal year employee bonuses in fiscal year no similar payments were made in fiscal year  and payment of higher severance costs in than in fiscal year pension plan matters we made a million cash contribution to our plan in january to meet our required contributions for fiscal year  while in fiscal year we made a voluntary cash contribution of million using a portion of our million in proceeds from the sale of real property in miami 
in fiscal year  in addition to the cash contribution  we made a non cash contribution of certain of our real property to meet our required funding obligation 
the property contributed in fiscal year was appraised at million 
in january  we contributed million of cash to the plan to meet our required contributions in fiscal year we expect this contribution will satisfy all of our required contributions in fiscal year see note for further discussion of our contributions 
as of the end of fiscal year  the projected benefit obligations of our plan exceeded plan assets by million compared to million at the end of fiscal year legislation enacted in the second quarter of mandated a change in the discount rates used to calculate the projected benefit obligations for purposes of funding pension plans 
the new legislation and calculation use historical averages of long term highly rated corporate bonds within ranges as defined in the legislation  which has resulted in the application of a higher discount rate to determine the projected benefit obligations for funding and current long term interest rates 
in addition  the pension relief act of pra provided relief with respect to the funding requirements of the plan 
under the pra  we elected an option that allows the required contributions related to our and plan years to be paid over years 
as a result of these two legislative actions  we estimate that under internal revenue service funding rules the projected benefit obligations of our plan exceeded plan assets by approximately million at the end of calendar however  even with the relief provided by the two legislative rules discussed above  based on the current funding position of the plan  we expect future contributions will be required 
while amounts of future contributions are subject to numerous assumptions  including  among others  changes in interest rates  returns on assets in the plan and future government regulations  we estimate that a total of approximately million will be required to be contributed to the plan in fiscal year the timing and amount of payments to the plan reflect actuarial estimates we believe to be reasonable but are subject to changes in estimates 
we believe cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our contribution requirements

in addition  we paid million to retire million in aggregate principal of notes that would have matured in fiscal year and we paid million in costs associated with the various refinancing transactions  most of which were recorded as deferred financing charges and the rest recorded as a loss on debt extinguishment 
debt and related matters as of december   we had approximately billion in total principal indebtedness outstanding  including a current portion of long term debt of million in notes  resulting from our commitment to redeem the notes by january  in addition  we had the following aggregate principal amounts of debt outstanding million of notes  million of notes due in  million of notes due in  million of debentures due in and million of debentures due in credit agreement in connection with the issuance of the notes  discussed below  we entered into the credit agreement  dated as of december  the credit agreement amended and restated in its entirety the second amended and restated credit agreement dated june  the credit agreement provides for million in revolving credit commitments  with a million letter of credit subfacility  
table of contents and a maturity date of december  as of december   there were no draws and million face amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement 
as of december   million  net of the letters of credit  was available under our revolving facility under the credit agreement 
in february  we purchased million aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt  in the open market  which consisted of million aggregate principal amount of our notes due in and million aggregate principal amount of our notes due in loans under the credit agreement bear interest  at our option  at either the london interbank offered rate plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  or at a base rate plus a spread ranging from basis points to basis points  in each case based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
the credit agreement provides for a commitment fee payable on the unused revolving credit ranging from basis points to basis points  based upon our consolidated total leverage ratio 
the financial covenants under the credit agreement require us to comply with a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio  each measured quarterly 
we are required to maintain a consolidated total leverage ratio of not more than to  which ratio will decrease at the end of our first fiscal quarter of to to for the remainder of the term of the credit agreement 
we are also required to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least to 
the credit agreement also prohibits the payment of a dividend if a payment would not be permitted under the indenture for the senior secured notes discussed below 
dividends under the indenture for the senior secured notes are allowed if the consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than to and the priority leverage ratio as defined in the indenture is less than to 
as of december   our consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement was to and consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement was to 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants 
due to the significance of our outstanding debt  remaining in compliance with debt covenants is critical to our operations 
if revenue declines continue beyond those currently anticipated  we expect to continue to restructure operations and reduce debt to maintain compliance with our covenants 
on june   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement previous agreement to amend and replace our amended and restated credit agreement from january  the previous agreement terms  among other things  i reduced the size of the revolving loan facility from million to million to cover our issuances of standby letters of credit and ii extended the maturity of the previous agreement to january  the new committed amount was only available for the issuance of standby letters of credit 
senior secured notes and indenture on december   we issued million aggregate principal amount of notes

in connection with the tender offer of the notes  we recorded a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately million 
by january   we redeemed the remaining million aggregate principal amount of notes not tendered in the tender offer and will record a loss on the extinguishment of debt of approximately million during the quarter ended march  the indenture for the notes includes a number of restrictive covenants that are applicable to us and our restricted subsidiaries

h the table excludes unrecognized tax benefits  and related penalties and interest  totaling million because a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments  if any  cannot be determined 
the table also excludes purchase commitments associated with the purchase of  metric tons of newsprint  as the price is not determinable because it is based on the market price at the time of purchase 

table of contents critical accounting policies the accompanying md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  future events are subject to change and the best estimates and judgments routinely require adjustment 
the most significant areas involving estimates and assumptions are amortization and or impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  pension and post retirement expenses  insurance reserves  and our accounting for income taxes 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  in particular  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible impairment we test goodwill for impairment annually at year end or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such indicators of impairment may include  but are not limited to  changes in business climate such as an economic downturn  significant operating cash flow declines related to our newspapers or a major change in the assessment of future operations of our newspapers  or a sustained decline in our stock price below the per share book value of stockholders equity 
we conducted our annual impairment testing as of december   december   and december  summary of approach and analysis of impairments the required two step approach to test for impairment requires the use of accounting judgments and estimates of future operating results 
because accounting standards require that impairment testing be done at a reporting unit level  we perform this testing on our operating segments which are considered reporting units 
an impairment charge generally is recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
we estimated fair value of the reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow dcf model and market based approaches 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value are based upon a combination of historical results and trends  new industry developments  future cash flow projections  and relevant comparable company valuation multiples for the market based approach 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the market based approach used in the valuation effort includes guideline public company method 
the various valuation methods are weighted to reach a fair value conclusion for our operating reporting units 
assumptions used in the dcf model including the following the projected cash flows are based on estimates of revenues  newsprint expenses and other cash costs 
while these estimates are always inherently subject to risks and uncertainties  the ability to project future operations and in particular advertising revenues is difficult 
the discount rate is determined using our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for risks perceived by investors which are implicit in our publicly traded stock price 
the amount of a goodwill impairment charge requires management to allocate the fair value of the reporting units to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  using our best judgments and estimates in valuing the reporting unit  to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting total fair value of the reporting units is then reconciled to our market capitalization  giving effect to an appropriate control premium 
a goodwill impairment charge 
table of contents is recorded to the extent that the implied goodwill values are below the book value of goodwill for the reporting units 
fair value calculations by their nature require us to make assumptions about future operating results that can be difficult to predict with certainty 
they are influenced by our views of future advertising trends in the industry and in the markets in which we operate newspapers 
the variability in these trends and the difficulty in projecting advertising growth  in particular  in each newspaper market are impacted by the declines in advertising in recent years 
we implemented restructuring plans which have mitigated the impact of these declines on our cash flows and helped stabilize operations 
based on our analysis  at december   the fair values of our reporting units that primarily consists of operations in california  the northwest and texas  exceeded the carrying value by approximately  and the operating segment that primarily consists of operations in the southeast  the gulf coast and the midwest exceeded the carrying value by approximately 
masthead considerations newspaper mastheads newspaper titles and website domain names are not subject to amortization and are tested for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of each newspaper masthead with its carrying amount 
we use a relief from royalty approach that utilizes a dcf to determine the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
our judgments and estimates of future operating results in determining the reporting unit fair values are consistently applied to each newspaper in determining the fair value of each newspaper masthead 
we performed our annual impairment tests on newspaper mastheads as of december   december   and december  as a result of our testing  we recorded a charge of million for masthead impairments in fiscal year no impairment charges to the value of mastheads were recorded in or other intangible assets considerations long lived assets such as intangible assets are subject to amortization primarily advertiser and subscriber lists and are tested for recoverability whenever events or change in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of each asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of such asset group 
no impairment loss was recognized on intangible assets subject to amortization in fiscal years  or pension and post retirement benefits we have significant pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in establishing these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future because of changes resulting from fluctuations in our employee headcount and or changes in the various assumptions 
current standards of accounting for defined benefit pension plans and post retirement benefit plans requires recognition of the funded status of a pension plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation and the funded status of a post retirement plan difference between the plan assets at fair value and the accumulated benefit obligation  as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december   net retirement obligations in excess of the retirement plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets and for our qualified plan 
at december   net retirement obligations in excess of retirement 
table of contents plans assets were million 
this amount included million for non qualified plans that do not have assets and million for our qualified plan 
we used discount rates of to and an assumed long term return on assets of to calculate our retirement plan expenses in for fiscal year  a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net benefit cost a decrease of basis points in the long term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
for fiscal year  we expect to reduce our long term return on assets from to 
income taxes our current and deferred income tax provisions are calculated based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if needed  throughout the year 
adjustments between our estimates and the actual results of filed returns are recorded when identified 
the amount of income taxes paid is subject to periodic audits by federal and state taxing authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
these audits may challenge certain aspects of our tax positions such as the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of taxable income to the various tax jurisdictions 
income tax contingencies require significant judgment in estimating final outcomes 
actual results could materially differ from these estimates and could significantly affect the effective tax rate and cash flows in future periods 
insurance we are insured for workers compensation using both self insurance and large deductible programs 
we rely on claims experience in determining an adequate provision for insurance claims 
we used a discount rate of to calculate workers compensation reserves as of december  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have had an immaterial effect on total workers compensation reserves 
a increase in the claims would have increased the total workers compensation reserves  net of estimated recoveries  by approximately million

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and credit risk 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonably possible losses 
our exposure to market risk primarily relates to discount rates used in our pension liabilities 
interest rate risks in our debt obligations substantially all of our outstanding debt is composed of fixed rate bonds and  therefore  is not subject to interest rate fluctuations 
discount rate risks in our pension and post retirement obligations the discount rate used to measure our obligations under our qualified defined benefit pension plan is generally based upon long term interest rates on highly rated corporate bonds 
hence  changes in long term interest rates may have a significant impact on the funding position of our qualified defined pension plan 
we estimate that a increase in our discount rate could decrease our pension obligations by approximately million 
based on current interest rates  the amount of contributions due to the plan and the timing of the payments of these obligations are included in the table of contractual obligations above and reflect actuarial estimates we believe to be reasonable
