item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of post holdings  inc this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements under item  and the cautionary statement on forward looking statements on page results of operations overview we are a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of branded and private label ready to eat cereals  snacks and active nutrition products in the united states and canada 
our post foods business is the third largest seller of ready to eat cereals in the united states with a share of retail sales based on retail dollar sales for the week period ended september   according to nielsen 
most of our products are manufactured through a flexible production platform consisting of five primary facilities  four of which are owned by us  and sold through a variety of channels such as grocery stores  mass merchandisers  club stores and drug stores 
from to  our predecessor  postum cereal company  acquired over a dozen companies and expanded its product line to more than products 
the company changed its name to general foods corporation and over several decades introduced household names such as post raisin bran  honeycomb  pebbles and honey bunches of oats 
general foods corporation was acquired by philip morris companies in  and subsequently merged with kraft in in  the post cereals business was split off from kraft and acquired by ralcorp holdings  inc on february   post completed its legal separation via a tax free spin off the spin off from ralcorp ralcorp was subsequently acquired by conagra foods  inc on january  
in the spin off  ralcorp shareholders of record on january   received one share of post common stock for every two shares of ralcorp common stock held 
on february   post began regular trading on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol post as an independent  public company 
in  we had a single operating segment 
as a result of recent acquisitions  post now operates in three reportable segments post foods  attune foods and active nutrition 
the post foods segment predominately includes the post branded ready to eat cereal business 
the attune foods segment manufactures and distributes premium natural organic cereals and snacks and is comprised of the business of attune foods  inc  which we acquired in december  and certain assets of the hearthside food solutions private label and branded cereal  granola and snack businesses  which we acquired in may the active nutrition segment includes the business of premier nutrition corporation pnc  which we acquired in september the active nutrition segment manufactures and sells high protein shakes and bars as well as nutritional supplements 
our portfolio of brands includes diverse offerings such as honey bunches of oats  pebbles  post selects  great grains  spoon size shredded wheat  post raisin bran  grape nuts  honeycomb  attune  uncle sam  erewhon  golden temple  peace cereal  sweet home farm  willamette valley granola company  premier protein and joint juice

excluding the impact of acquisitions  net sales increased 
volume increases have been driven by growth in our great grains  good morenings  grape nuts  and post raisin bran brands  partially offset by declines in our post shredded wheat and pebbles brands 
additionally  we had meaningful growth from new product offerings associated with private label and co manufacturing agreements 
fiscal compared to net sales for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to prior year  primarily driven by a decline in overall volumes  partially offset by higher average gross and net selling prices

table of contents fiscal compared to gross profit margins were in  down from in gross profit margin declines were driven by lower net selling prices  million of accelerated depreciation related to the closing of our modesto  california facility  and million higher raw material costs primarily grains  fruits and packaging partially offset by favorable sugar and nuts 
gross profit margins were also impacted by the acquisitions of the lower margin attune and pnc businesses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly from in to in excluding the impact of acquisitions  sg a as a percentage of net sales increased percentage points 
the increase in sg a was primarily due to higher compensation related costs resulting from an increase in head count  partially offset in the prior year by higher transition services agreement tsa charges  as well as higher cash and noncash stock based compensation expense in the current year of million  acquisition related costs of million for transactions that were signed  and spending of million for due diligence on potential acquisitions that were not signed 
these negative impacts were partially offset by lower spin off non recurring costs of million in the current year as compared to advertising and promotion costs decreased million for the post foods segment  returning to an amount consistent with historical levels 
advertising spending was increased in to provide advertising support for our overall brand portfolio in line with our strategy to stabilize our market share in the ready to eat rte cereal category 
advertising and promotion spending in for acquired businesses was approximately million 
total amortization expense for the current year was million compared to million last year 
the increase is due to amortization recorded in the current year related to the acquired intangible assets of attune foods and pnc 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to from 
this decrease was driven by lower gross margins and increased amortization expense  partially offset by slightly lower sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales  all of which are described above 
in addition to the items previously discussed  operating profit was negatively impacted by million of restructuring expenses related to the closure of our modesto  california facility as well as an impairment charge of million related to our post shredded wheat and post brand trademarks 
fiscal compared to gross profit margins decreased by percentage points in compared to gross profit margin declines were driven by million of higher raw material costs primarily grains and sugar and million of unfavorable other manufacturing costs primarily driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption due to lower production volumes and million of higher freight costs 
sg a as a percentage of net sales increased by percentage points 
sg a was negatively impacted by million of costs incurred to effect the separation of post from ralcorp and to begin transitioning post to stand alone processes and procedures during the fiscal year excluding the effect of these costs  sg a as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in this increase was driven by million of increased advertising and promotion costs to provide advertising support for our overall brand portfolio in line with our strategy to stabilize our market share in the rte cereal category 
the remaining increase was driven by incremental holding company costs and higher operating company overhead for the new direct sales force and higher bonus costs partially offset by lower warehousing and broker expense 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to from negative 
excluding the impact of the prior year impairment charge of million  operating profit margin decreased from to 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the impairment charge 
this decrease was primarily driven by lower sales and margin compression in the current year and due to increases in sg a as previously described 
restructuring costs in april  we announced management s decision to close our manufacturing facility located in modesto  california as part of a cost savings and capacity rationalization effort 
the transfer of production capabilities and closure of the plant is expected to be completed by september during the year ended september   we incurred approximately million of expenses related to the plant closing 
this includes million of accelerated depreciation on plant assets recorded in cost of goods sold and approximately million of employee termination benefits recorded as restructuring expense 
upon completion of the transfer and start up of production to other facilities  we expect to achieve net pretax annual cash manufacturing cost savings of approximately million 
acquisition related costs during the year ended september   we incurred approximately million of expenses  recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses  primarily attributable to professional service fees related to fiscal acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of attune foods  inc  certain assets of hearthside food solutions  and pnc as well as the announced acquisition 
table of contents of dakota growers pasta company which is expected to close in january in addition  we recorded a one time expense in the amount of million  recorded as cost of goods sold  related to a step up adjustment of acquired inventory 
spin off non recurring costs in fiscal  and  we incurred separation related costs of million  million and million  respectively 
these costs are primarily related to third party professional service fees to effect the spin off and professional service fees and duplicative costs incurred by post to establish stand alone processes and systems for activities performed by ralcorp under the tsa 
all of the costs described above are reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
for more information on our transactions with ralcorp refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets during september  we concluded two indefinite lived trademarks were impaired and we recorded impairment losses of million for our post shredded wheat brand and million for our post brand to record these trademarks at their estimated current fair values of million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded non cash impairment charges totaling million 
these charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of million and trademark impairment charges of million 
for more information  refer to critical accounting policies and estimates as well as notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million for the year ended september  compared to fiscal the increase is driven primarily by the increase in outstanding debt through the issuance of an additional million of our senior notes the senior notes as well as an increase in our weighted average interest rate 
the increase in the weighted average interest rate is due to a change in debt mix with the repayment of our lower rate term loan during the year and the aforementioned increase in the senior notes 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended september  the increase is driven primarily by the increase in outstanding debt through the issuance of million of senior notes and a million term loan in connection with our separation from ralcorp 
prior year interest expense and current year interest expense up to the date of separation from ralcorp was related to debt obligations of ralcorp which were assumed from kraft in the august acquisition of post 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements and below in liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our indebtedness and related interest expense 
income taxes income tax expense was million  which represents an effective income tax rate of  for the year ended september   compared to million and an effective income tax rate of for the year ended september  the prior year effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by tax expense related to an uncertain tax position of which we took on our short period tax return for the period starting with the separation from ralcorp and ending on september  the prior year effective income tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by million of non deductible outside service expenses incurred to effect the company s separation from ralcorp  which resulted in incremental income tax expense of approximately million 
excluding the effect of these items  our effective tax rate for the year ended september  would have been approximately income tax expense was a benefit of million and an effective income tax rate of negative  for the year ended september  the annual effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the nondeductible goodwill impairment expense incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal excluding the effect of the goodwill impairment charge and the effect of the domestic production activities deduction dpad discussed below  our effective tax rate for would have been approximately 
the effective income tax rates for fiscal years  and were all favorably impacted by the effects of the dpad 
the dpad is a us federal deduction of a percentage of taxable income from domestic manufacturing 
for all three years  the dpad percentage was of qualifying taxable income

attune foods net sales for the attune foods segment were million for the year ended september  including million of sales to the post foods segment 
segment profit of million for the year ended september   was negatively impacted by acquisition accounting related inventory valuation adjustments of million 

table of contents active nutrition net sales for the active nutrition segment consisting solely of the results of the current year acquisition of pnc in september were million for the year ended september  the segment contributed million to operating results in fiscal liquidity and capital resources on october  and july   we issued an incremental million and million  respectively  of aggregate principal value of senior notes 
the senior notes were issued at prices of and of par value  respectively 
in february  we authorized and issued approximately million shares of series b cumulative perpetual convertible preferred stock 
we received net proceeds of million after paying fees and expenses of approximately million related to the offering 
on february   we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the term loan facility using the proceeds from the february preferred stock offering 
on july   we terminated the revolving credit facility under the credit facility dated as of february  on november   we issued million principal value of senior notes due in december the following table shows cash flow data for fiscal years  and  which is discussed below 
year ended september  dollars in millions cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents historically  we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations  supported by favorable operating income margins 
we believe our cash on hand  cash flows from operations and our access to capital markets will be sufficient to satisfy our future working capital  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions and other financing requirements for the foreseeable future 
our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on general economic conditions  competitive pressures and other business and risk factors 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or otherwise to comply with the terms of our credit facilities  we may be required to seek additional financing alternatives 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
short term financing needs primarily consist of working capital requirements  interest payments on our senior notes and dividend payments on our cumulative preferred stock 
long term financing needs will depend largely on potential growth opportunities  including acquisition activity 
operating activities fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  decreased by million compared to the fiscal year ended september  the decrease includes incremental cash of million provided by the premium received on the issuances of our senior notes in the current year 
after reducing current year operating cash flows for this item  the decrease from the prior year period was million 
this decrease was primarily driven by increased interest payments of million in fiscal in fiscal  prior to our spin off from ralcorp  we were not required to cash settle interest expense 
in addition  working capital changes during the year ended september  were unfavorable by million when compared to fiscal  primarily as result of the timing of our trade accounts payable and advertising and promotions payments 
fiscal compared to cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended september  increased by million compared to the fiscal year ended september  primarily driven by lower gross profit and increased selling  general and administrative costs which were offset by million of favorable working capital changes when compared to fiscal  primarily driven by the timing of payment on increased advertising and promotional activity in fiscal 
table of contents investing activities fiscal compared to cash used in investing activities for fiscal increased by million compared to fiscal the increase was driven by the fiscal acquisitions of substantially all of the assets of attune foods  inc  certain assets of hearthside food solutions and pnc 
net cash paid for these three acquisitions was million 
cash used in investing activities was also impacted in the current year by a million cash deposit  classified as restricted cash  due upon the signing of the purchase agreement for the acquisition of dakota growers  announced in september capital expenditures were million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
expenditures in these years included machinery and equipment additions to our battle creek  michigan plant needed to absorb production from our modesto  california facility  as well as expenditures made to build out our stand alone it infrastructure in the current year and the purchase of our corporate office building and related furniture and fixtures in the prior year 
fiscal compared to cash used in investing activities for fiscal increased by million compared to fiscal the increase was driven primarily by the purchase of a corporate office building and related furniture and fixtures in the first half of and an increase in general plant maintenance and upgrades 
financing activities fiscal compared to cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to cash used of million in the increase is primarily driven by proceeds received from the issuance of additional debt of million and the net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million  partially offset by the payment of related debt issuance costs and the million principal repayment on our term loan during the year ended september  fiscal compared to cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal in connection with our separation from ralcorp  we issued million in debt of which million was remitted to ralcorp and approximately million was paid as debt issuance costs  with the remaining million in proceeds retained by the company 
the components of the change in net investment of ralcorp include cash deposits from post to ralcorp and cash borrowings received from ralcorp used to fund operations or capital expenditures and allocation for ralcorp s corporate expenses prior to our separation from ralcorp 
on september   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
additionally  during fiscal  we made million in scheduled repayments on our term loan facility 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into contracts and commitments which obligate us to make payments in the future

f we have excluded from the table above million for certain provisions of asc income taxes associated with liabilities for uncertain tax positions due to the uncertainty as to the amount and timing of payment  if any 
inflation inflationary pressures have had an adverse effect on post through higher raw material and fuel costs 
we believe that inflation has not had a material adverse impact on our operations for the years ended september   and  but could have a material impact in the future if inflation rates were to significantly exceed our ability to achieve price increases 
currency certain sales and costs of our canadian operations were denominated in canadian dollars 
consequently  profits from this business can be impacted by fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollars relative to us dollars 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that would be reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
at the time of the separation  we entered into an agreement to indemnify ralcorp from various exposures  including any tax liability that may arise as a result of the separation 
see risks related to the separation from ralcorp earlier in this document for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion is presented pursuant to the united states securities and exchange commission s financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the policies below are both important to the representation of post s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
those estimates form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title of goods is transferred to the customer  as specified by the shipping terms 
net sales reflect gross sales  including amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling  less sales discounts and trade allowances including promotional price buy downs and new item promotional funding 
customer trade allowances are generally computed as a percentage of gross sales 
products are generally sold with no right of return except in the case of goods which do not meet product specifications or are damaged and related reserves are maintained based on return history 
if additional rights of return are granted  revenue recognition is deferred 
estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive offerings are based upon customer redemption history 
inventory inventories are generally valued at the lower of average cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete product and packaging materials 
the estimated allowance is based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
if market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
long lived assets we review long lived assets  including leasehold improvements  property and equipment  and amortized intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the cost to sell 
indefinite lived assets trademarks with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate the trademark may be impaired 
in conjunction with this review  we adopted asu  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
in assessing other intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment  we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if we determine that it is not more 
table of contents likely than not that the fair value of such an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  then we are not required to perform any additional tests for assessing intangible assets for impairment 
however  if we conclude otherwise or elect not to perform the qualitative assessment  then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test that involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we elected not to perform a qualitative assessment in and instead performed a quantitative impairment test  as allowed for in asu the estimated fair value is determined using an income based approach the relief from royalty method  which requires significant assumptions for each brand  including estimates regarding future revenue growth  discount rates  and appropriate royalty rates 
in our test as of september   we assumed a discount rate of and royalty rates ranging from to based on consideration of several factors for each brand  including profit levels  research of external royalty rates by third party experts  and the relative importance of each brand to the company 
revenue growth assumptions are based on historical trends and management s expectations for future growth by brand 
the discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of similar companies 
based on our assessment  we concluded two indefinite lived trademarks were impaired at september  and we recorded impairment losses of million for our post shredded wheat brand and million for our post brand to record these trademarks at their estimated current fair values of million and million  respectively 
the impairments for these trademarks were the result of a variety of factors including a basis point increase in the assumed discount rate compared to the discount rate assumed in the prior year and in the case of post shredded wheat  weak current year performance and a corresponding lowering of expected future revenue growth for the brand 
our long range plan for post shredded wheat assumes a reduction in the rate of revenue declines for the brand and ultimately stabilization of brand revenues 
if we are unable to slow the rate of decline and ultimately stabilize brand revenues  additional impairment losses are likely 
the failure in the future to achieve forecasted revenue growth rates  further increases in the discount rate  or a significant change in the trademark profitability and corresponding royalty rate assumed could result in the recognition of additional trademark impairment losses 
as of september   the estimated fair value exceeded book carrying value of all indefinite lived trademarks by greater than  with the exception of the two trademarks discussed above and our great grains trademark 
the estimated fair value for the great grains trademark only slightly exceeded its book carrying value of million 
accordingly  a small unfavorable change in any of the assumptions affecting the valuation of our post shredded wheat  great grains and post trademarks would likely result in an additional impairment  which could be material to our financial statements 
for fiscal year  we performed a quantitative impairment assessment similar to the fiscal assessment described above 
as of september   we concluded there was no impairment of trademarks with indefinite lives 
in june  a trademark impairment loss of million was recognized related to the post shredded wheat and grape nuts trademarks based on reassessments triggered by the announced separation of post from ralcorp 
the trademark impairment was due to reductions in anticipated future sales as a result of competition  lack of consumer response to advertising and promotions for these brands  and further reallocations of advertising and promotion expenditures to higher return brands 
these factors  particularly the lower than expected revenues during and further declines in market share  led us to lower royalty rates for both the post shredded wheat and grape nuts brands as well as further reduce future sales growth rates  resulting in a partial impairment of both brands 
based upon a preliminary review of the post business conducted by the newly appointed post management team in october  sales declines in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing into october  and weakness in the branded ready to eat cereal category and the broader economy  management determined that additional strategic steps were needed to stabilize the business and the competitive position of its brands 
the impact of these steps was a reduction of expected net sales growth rates and profitability of certain brands in the near term 
consequently  an additional trademark impairment loss of million was recognized in the quarter ended september   primarily related to the honey bunches of oats  post selects  and post trademarks 
as noted above  assessing the fair value of our indefinite lived trademarks includes  among other things  making key assumptions for estimating revenue growth rates and profitability and corresponding royalty rates by brand 
these assumptions are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we make every effort to estimate revenue growth rates and profitability by brand as accurately as possible with the information available at the time the forecast is developed 
however  changes in the assumptions and estimates may affect the estimated fair value of the individual trademark  and could result in additional impairment charges in future periods 
factors that have the potential to create variances in the estimated fair value of each trademark include but are not limited to i fluctuations in forecasted sales volumes  which can be driven by multiple external factors affecting demand  including macroeconomic factors  competitive dynamics in the ready to eat cereal category  changes in consumer preferences  and consumer responsiveness to our promotional and advertising activities  ii product costs  particularly commodities such as wheat  corn  rice  sugar  nuts  oats  corrugated packaging and diesel  and other production costs which could negatively impact profitability and corresponding royalty rate  and iii interest rate fluctuations and the overall impact of these changes on the appropriate discount rate 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted asu no 
intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment 
we conduct a goodwill impairment qualitative assessment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year following the annual forecasting process  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
the goodwill impairment qualitative assessment requires us to perform an assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the business is less than its carrying amount 
the qualitative assessment considers various factors  including the macroeconomic environment  industry and market specific conditions  financial performance  cost impacts  and issues or events specific to the business 
if adverse qualitative trends are identified that could negatively impact the fair value of the business  we perform a step one goodwill impairment test 
for fiscal  we determined that our recent history of goodwill impairment combined with limited fair value excesses in prior valuations were significant qualitative factors which required us to complete the step one goodwill impairment test for our post foods reporting unit 
we also concluded that step one goodwill impairment tests were warranted for our attune foods and active nutrition reporting units because of the recency of acquisition of those reporting units during the current fiscal year 
the step one goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and certain assets and liabilities 
the estimated fair values were determined using a combined income and market approach with a greater weighting on the income approach of the calculation for post foods and attune foods and of the calculation for active nutrition 
the income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions  including estimates regarding future revenue  profitability  and capital requirements 
the market approach of the calculation for post foods and attune foods and for active nutrition is based on a market multiple revenue and ebitda which stands for earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization and requires an estimate of appropriate multiples based on market data 
as of september   we had goodwill balances of  million  million and million in our post foods  attune foods and active nutrition reporting units  respectively 
for the calculation of fair value of our reporting units  we used the following key assumptions post foods attune foods active nutrition future revenue growth terminal revenue growth rate discount rate ebitda multiple for market approach fiscal x x n a fiscal x x n a revenue multiple for market approach fiscal x x n a fiscal x x n a revenue growth assumptions along with profitability and cash flow assumptions were based on historical trends for the reporting units and management expectations for future growth 
the discount rates were based on a weighted average cost of capital utilizing industry market data of businesses similar to the reporting units 
for the market approach  we used estimated ebitda and revenue multiples as listed in the table above for post foods and attune foods based on industry market data 
for the active nutrition reporting unit  we did not use the market approach because we concluded that the selected industry market data was not consistent with a business with the near term growth expectations of the active nutrition reporting unit 
an unfavorable change in forecasted operating results and cash flows  an increase in discount rates based on changes in cost of capital interest rates  etc  or a decline in industry market ebitda and revenue multiples for any of our reporting units may reduce the estimated reporting unit fair value below carrying value and would possibly result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss 
the table below provides sensitivities for certain key variables in our goodwill impairment analysis for each of our reporting units 
in all cases  the table presents the amount of change in each respective variable  holding all other variables constant  that would have resulted in an indication of potential impairment for the respective reporting unit 
changes equal to or greater than the amounts reflected in the table would have resulted in a failure of step one of the test and would have resulted in a step two analysis to determine the amount of any impairment 
post foods attune foods active nutrition discount rate increase increase increase revenue growth rate decrease decrease decrease revenue multiple decrease x decrease x n a ebitda multiple decrease x decrease x n a 
table of contents as of september   we performed a step one goodwill impairment test using the methodology as described above 
as of september   we concluded there was no indication of goodwill impairment 
in fiscal  the revised business outlook of our new management team as described in the discussion of the trademark impairment loss for the quarter ended september   above triggered a step one goodwill impairment analysis 
because the carrying value was determined to be in excess of its fair value in our step one analysis  we were required to perform step two of the impairment analysis to determine the amount of goodwill impairment to be recorded 
the amount of the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount  which required us to allocate the fair value determined in the step one analysis to the individual assets and liabilities of the business 
any remaining fair value would represent the implied fair value of goodwill on the testing date 
based on the step two analysis  we recorded a pre tax  non cash impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill 
pension and other postretirement benefits pension assets and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the estimated market related value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  discount rates  future salary increases  and other assumptions inherent in these valuations 
we annually review the assumptions underlying the actuarial calculations and make changes to these assumptions  based on current market conditions and historical trends  as necessary 
differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets and changes to projected future rates of return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized 
the other postretirement benefits liability partially subsidized retiree health and life insurance is also determined on an actuarial basis and is affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected trends in healthcare costs 
changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and expected healthcare costs will affect the recorded amount of other postretirement benefits expense 
for both pensions and postretirement benefit calculations  the assumed discount rate is determined by projecting the plans expected future benefit payments as defined for the projected benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation  discounting those expected payments using a theoretical zero coupon spot yield curve derived from a universe of high quality rated aa or better by moody s investor service corporate bonds as of the measurement date  and solving for the single equivalent discount rate that results in the same present value 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate from to for us pension  from to for us other postretirement benefits  from to for canadian pension  and from to for canadian other postretirement benefits would have increased the recorded benefit obligations at september  by approximately million for pensions and approximately million for other postretirement benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various asset classes  using the target allocations of the plans 
a decrease in the assumed return on plan assets from to for us and from to for canadian would have increased the net periodic benefit cost for the pension plans by approximately million 
we expect to contribute million to the combined pension plans and million to our postretirement medical benefit plans in fiscal contributions beyond remain uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in actuarial assumptions  actual return on plan assets and any legislative or regulatory changes that may affect plan funding requirements

stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period for awards expected to vest 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited before vesting 
for equity awards  the original estimate of the grant date fair value is not subsequently revised unless the awards are modified  but the estimate of expected forfeitures is revised throughout the vesting period and the cumulative stock based compensation cost recognized is adjusted accordingly 
for liability awards  the fair value is remeasured at the end of each reporting period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information about stock based compensation and our related estimates 
income tax we estimate income tax expense based on taxes in each jurisdiction 
we estimate current tax exposures together with temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we believe that sufficient income will be generated in the future to realize the benefit of most of our deferred tax assets 
where there is not sufficient evidence that such income is likely to be generated  we establish a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
we are subject to periodic audits by governmental tax authorities of our income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions  including state and local taxes  and record reserves for estimated exposures 
based on the provisions of the tax allocation agreement between post and ralcorp  ralcorp retained responsibility for income tax liabilities and income tax returns related to all periods prior to the spin off date of february  there are no open income tax audits in any of post s filing jurisdictions for periods subsequent to the spin off date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to commodity price risks relating to the acquisition of raw materials and fuels 
prior to the spin off from ralcorp  we participated in ralcorp s derivative financial instrument program 
since the spin off  we have implemented a stand alone derivative program  which includes the use of futures contracts  options and swaps  to manage certain of these exposures when it is practical to do so 
for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk we have foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our canadian entity  whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
interest rate risk as of september  and  we have indebtedness of  million and million  respectively  related to our senior notes 
in addition  as of september  we had our senior secured credit facility the credit facility for million which consisted of a million term loan  of which million was outstanding at september   and an unfunded revolving credit facility with million of capacity after consideration of million of letters of credit outstanding at that time 
on february   we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the term loan facility using the proceeds from a preferred stock offering completed in february see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on july   we terminated the revolving credit facility 
the senior notes bear fixed rate interest of per annum 
interest payments on the senior notes are due semi annually each february and august  with the first interest payment of million paid on august  the maturity date of the senior notes is february  borrowings under the credit facility bore interest at libor or a base rate as defined in the credit facility plus an applicable margin ranging from to for libor based loans and from to for base rate based loans  depending upon the company s consolidated leverage ratio 
accordingly  borrowings under the credit facility were subject to an element of market risk from changes in interest rates 
at september   the weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility was 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in the interest rate applicable to us would have resulted in a million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense for every million of floating rate debt we incurred  however  we had no variable rate debt outstanding as of september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information
