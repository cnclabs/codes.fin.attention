item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
the results of swss  our security solutions division  which were previously reported as a separate business segment  are being presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income loss and comprehensive income loss for all periods presented 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements and discontinued operations below on page for additional information regarding these discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  any reference to income statement items in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refers to results from continuing operations 
highlights our fiscal net sales of million represented an increase of from our fiscal net sales 
income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per fully diluted share  compared with income from continuing operations of million  or per fully diluted share  for fiscal our operating results for fiscal were affected by numerous factors  including the following the increase in net sales was primarily driven by our ability to respond to consistently increased consumer demand over the past two years with a increase in firearm units produced 
in spite of this increase in capacity  our backlog increased from million  excluding walther orders  at of the end of fiscal  to million  excluding walther orders  at of the end of fiscal we believe that a contributing factor to the increase in our backlog was the limited supply of our products in the sporting goods channel and at dealers 
we also believe that there may be a number of firearm retailers that placed orders through distributors that exceed the retailers actual requirements 
we continue to look for opportunities to address our increased backlog by further increasing our production capacity through additional capital spending and outsourcing components and parts 
the introduction of new products in the last several years combined with increased production volumes for our m p branded polymer pistols and modern sporting rifles have had a positive impact on our net sales and gross margins for fiscal in addition  increased consumer demand  which we believe has been caused by both increased customer acceptance of firearms as well as the fear of current and potential legislative restrictions on the sale or makeup of firearms has attributed to our sales and gross margin 
our gross profit increased percentage points from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of gained manufacturing efficiencies and favorable production mix  which resulted in a corresponding improvement in manufacturing fixed cost absorption 
we also implemented a new pricing and discount structure on selected products that improved both net sales and gross profit 
legal and consulting costs were million  which was million lower than million of costs incurred in the prior year related to the doj and sec investigations referenced in item a  risk factors 
our business we are one of the world s leading manufacturers of firearms 
we sell our products under the smith wesson brand  the m p brand  the thompson center arms brand  and the performance center brand 
we manufacture a wide array of handguns including revolvers and pistols  long guns including modern sporting rifles  bolt action rifles  and black powder firearms  handcuffs  and firearm related products and accessories for sale to a wide variety of customers  including gun enthusiasts  collectors  hunters  sportsmen  competitive shooters  individuals desiring home and personal protection  law enforcement and security agencies and officers  and military agencies in the united states and throughout the world 
we are one of the largest manufacturers of 
table of contents handguns  and handcuffs in the united states 
we manufacture our firearm products at our facilities in springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine 
we plan to continue to offer products that leverage the over year old smith wesson brand and capitalize on the goodwill developed through our historic american tradition by expanding consumer awareness of products we produce  especially m p branded products 
in addition  we pursue limited opportunities to license our name and trademarks to third parties for use in association with their products and services 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use adjusted ebitdas earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation expense  excluding large non recurring items  which is a non gaap financial metric  to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various firearm products by such measurements as gross margin per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data firearms have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  us handgun sales increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns because of the fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
sales levels then returned to pre levels and grew at normal industry growth rates until late in calendar  when sales increased in what appears to be fears surrounding crime and terrorism  an economic downturn  and a change in the white house administration 
like the increase in  this increase in sales was temporary in nature and sales returned to more normal levels in fiscal in late calendar and early calendar  orders again increased rapidly in what appears to be in response to fears of renewed legislative activity surrounding restrictions on the sale or makeup of firearms 
in addition  it appears that sales for all our products have recently increased because of our ability to increase production capacity to service orders from increased consumer demand caused by increased social acceptance of firearms 
we also believe the variety of products we offer and the attractive price points we maintain contributes to our likely increasing market share 
we estimate that we have a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with approximately in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in results of operations net sales the following table sets forth certain information regarding net product and services sales for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change handguns long guns walther other products services total net sales fiscal net sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year as we were able to address increased consumer demand over the past two years with a increase in firearm units produced 
our handgun products sales  which saw a net sales increase of over the prior fiscal year  were driven primarily by capacity increases on polymer pistol products and the growth in the concealed carry marketplace 
strong 
table of contents consumer demand for our m p rifles  including our full size  sport  and 
caliber long gun models increased net sales for that category by for the current fiscal year 
we also experienced productivity and efficiency gains as we completed the move of the production of our hunting products to our springfield  massachusetts facility last year resulting in increased unit sales of our bolt action rifles 
in addition  during fiscal  we implemented a new pricing and discount structure that improved net sales 
walther net sales increased from the prior fiscal year because of additional promotions and product availability in a market with high consumer demand 
our order backlog as of april  was million  which was million higher than at the end of fiscal and million higher than at the end of the third quarter of fiscal  primarily as a result of backlog generated by new products sales and increased consumer demand for all our firearms 
the orders received that have not yet shipped could be cancelled  particularly if demand were to suddenly decrease 
in addition  our backlog exceeds our annual manufacturing capacity 
therefore  our backlog may not be indicative of future sales 
at the end of fiscal  there was a limited supply of our products in the sporting goods channel and at dealers 
we believe that there are a number of firearm retailers that have placed orders through distributors that exceed the retailers actual requirements 
there is a possibility that such excess orders may have resulted in  and may continue to result in  our distributors placing excess orders with us  thereby potentially inflating our backlog 
net sales into our sporting goods distribution channel were million  a million  or  increase over sales of million for fiscal  primarily driven by increased customer demand for our polymer pistols and long guns and an increase in production capacity 
net sales into our professional channels  which include federal  international  and law enforcement sales  were million  a million  or  increase from fiscal net sales of million 
increased orders into our professional channels were primarily a result of increased net sales of our polymer products and long guns to law enforcement as well as increased international shipments to puerto rico and canada 
these amounts do not include our distributor and importer business with walther  which terminated at the end of fiscal or our manufacturing arrangement for walther ppk handguns  which will end at the end of fiscal fiscal net sales compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal increased over fiscal as we were able to address increased consumer demand because of increases in production capacity  particularly for handgun products  which saw a net sales increase of over fiscal  most noticeably on polymer pistol products 
net sales of long guns increased by in fiscal primarily because of strong demand for the m p sport model we introduced late in fiscal that hits an attractive price point offset by lower orders for black powder products 
long gun net sales were constrained by bolt action rifle sales as we service the thompson center arms venture rifle recall  and productivity and efficiency losses as we completed the move of our hunting production to our springfield  massachusetts facility 
walther net sales declined from fiscal because of increased competition in small frame  concealed carry products  and rimfire products 
other products and services net sales increased primarily because of the volume increases noted above 
net sales into our sporting goods distribution channel  excluding walther  were million  a million  or  increase over sales of million in fiscal  excluding walther  primarily driven by increased customer demand for our polymer pistols and modern sporting rifles 
net sales into our professional channels  excluding walther  were million  a  or  increase from fiscal net sales of million  excluding walther 
law enforcement channel net sales were higher  in part  because of increased shipments of our polymer pistol products to state agencies  such as the massachusetts and vermont state police  as well as an increase in handcuffs shipments to the california state police 
international sales  which include some consumer related sales  declined from fiscal because of the variable nature of international agency sales  which has been exacerbated as a result of our focus on fewer  but larger  international customers 

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit the following table sets forth certain information regarding cost of sales and gross profit for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change cost of sales of net sales gross profit of net sales fiscal cost of sales and gross profit compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased from the prior fiscal year primarily because of an increase in sales volume and a shift in product mix to higher margin polymer pistol products and long guns as a result of increased capacity to meet demand 
the increased gross profit was also a result of increased production volumes and favorable production mix  which resulted in a corresponding improvement in manufacturing fixed cost absorption 
that absorption increase  along with increased manufacturing efficiencies  resulted in a percentage point  or million in gross profit  increase  partially offset by increased volume related spending of million  or percentage points 
during fiscal  we incurred million of warranty costs associated with the thompson center arms bolt action rifle recall  and in fiscal  we incurred million of warranty costs associated with the thompson center arms venture rifle recall 
the fiscal unfavorable impact of the bolt action rifle recall was offset by costs incurred in fiscal relating to the prior year recall  resulted in an unfavorable impact on gross profit of percentage points  or million in fiscal during fiscal  we also incurred million of costs associated with the consolidation of our hunting production from rochester  new hampshire to our springfield  massachusetts facility  which were completed in the prior fiscal year 
we did not incur these costs in fiscal  which favorably impacted gross profit by percentage points  or million 
we had favorable currency exchange gains of percentage points  or million  on international purchases of products manufactured at walther facilities  and our pricing increases on a selection of products benefitted gross margin by percentage points  or million 
fiscal cost of sales and gross profit compared with fiscal gross profit for fiscal increased from fiscal primarily because of an increase in sales volume of our polymer products and long guns  as noted above  resulting in a corresponding improvement in manufacturing absorption 
in addition  we also had less inventory reserve adjustments and lower product liability related legal fees 
these reductions were offset by million of increased warranty costs associated with the recall of all our thompson center arms venture rifles manufactured since the product s introduction in mid and million of increased consulting services for procurement cost savings initiatives during fiscal operating expenses the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating expenses for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses of net sales 
table of contents operating expenses compared with fiscal research and development costs were relatively flat compared with fiscal with increased salary and benefit costs offset by reduced consulting expenses 
selling and marketing expenses decreased million  which was largely due to a million reduction in consulting and outside services relating to market research and an  reduction in sample costs from the prior year 
general and administrative costs increased over the prior year because of million of additional profit sharing expense  million of increased incentive accruals  and million of additional stock based compensation expense primarily related to options  rsus  and psus granted to our employees late in fiscal  million of additional bad debt expense offset by million of reduced legal and consulting fees  of which million related to our investigation of the doj and sec matters and  of employee related costs resulting from severance benefits paid to our former president and chief executive officer in the prior year 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by  predominately because the increased volume did not require a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
in addition  reduced market research and sample costs and reduced costs related to the doj and sec matters were partially offset by increased employee costs 
fiscal operating expenses compared with fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal were relatively flat as compared with fiscal with the slight increase due to salary and benefit costs 
the reduced selling and marketing expenses were primarily a result of a million reduction in consulting and outside services as a result of cost cutting initiatives implemented late in fiscal and reduced spending from improvements made during fiscal in our customer acceptance process  market research and consulting  and licensing consulting 
general and administrative costs were relatively flat compared with fiscal representing reductions associated with million of reduced legal and consulting fees related our investigation of the doj and sec matters  million reduced bad debt expense   of reduced legal fees because of an international trade commission itc action against several of our black powder competitors in fiscal and reduced consulting expenses for internal audit activities 
these amounts were offset by million of higher profit sharing   of higher stock based compensation expense  and million of higher management incentive compensation accrual 
operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by  predominately because of the reduced costs related to the doj and sec matters  cost cutting initiatives put in place late in fiscal  and increased net sales 
operating income from continuing operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding operating income from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating income from continuing operations of net sales fiscal operating income from continuing operations compared with fiscal in fiscal  we increased sales by over while only increasing operating expenses by 
thus  the increase in operating income from continuing operations resulted from increased sales volumes which improved manufacturing fixed cost absorption  favorable production mix  increased manufacturing efficiencies  and price increases on selected products 
we also experienced reduced plant consolidation costs as a result of moving the production of our hunting products to our springfield  massachusetts facility in the prior year  reduced legal and consulting fees on the doj and sec matters as well as related improvements made to our customer acceptance process in foreign markets  partially offset by increased employee costs associated with increased profitability  and costs associated with the recall of our thompson center arms bolt action rifles noted above 

table of contents fiscal operating income from continuing operations compared with fiscal the significant increase in operating income from continuing operations resulted from increased sales volumes  the corresponding impact of improved absorption  and the cost cutting initiatives 
in addition  decreased spending related to the doj and sec matters and reduced spending associated with the relocation of our hunting production from our rochester  new hampshire facility to our springfield  massachusetts facility contributed to the increase in operating income 
interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change interest expense interest expense decreased for fiscal compared with the prior fiscal year because of the repurchase of million of our senior convertible notes the convertible notes in fiscal and reduced amortization in connection with the write off of debt issuance costs as a result of the reduction of our line of credit during the prior fiscal year 
the reduction of interest expense was offset by  of additional bond premium and  of debt issuance write off costs we recorded in order to retire million of our senior notes during fiscal interest expense increased for fiscal compared with fiscal because of increased interest expense related to our senior notes  which bear interest at a rate of per annum compared with our convertible notes  which bore interest at a rate of per annum 
in december  we were required to repurchase million of the convertible notes and we redeemed the remaining  of the convertible notes in january we also amortized an additional  of debt issuance costs that we wrote off in connection with reducing our line of credit in october income tax expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change income tax expense our income tax expense for fiscal included the effect of changes in temporary differences between book value and tax bases of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled million  after valuation allowance  as of april  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to   and million as of april    and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforwards at april  expire in fiscal internal revenue code section limits our utilization of these losses to approximately  in fiscal and each subsequent year 
it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in a reduction in some or all of our loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that could be utilized 
adjustments to reserves and book versus tax difference on depreciation of fixed assets decreased the overall net deferred tax asset from million as of april  to million as of april  there were million and million of state net operating loss carryforwards as of april  and  respectively 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between april  and april  there were million and million of state tax credit carryforwards as of april  
table of contents and  respectively 
the state tax credit carryforwards will expire between april  and april   or have no expiration date 
as of april   valuation allowances of  and million were provided on our deferred tax assets for state net operating losses and state tax credits  respectively  that we do not anticipate using prior to their expiration and a  valuation allowance was provided on other state deferred tax assets for which we anticipate we will realize no benefit 
as of april   valuation allowances of  and million were provided on our deferred tax assets for a federal capital loss carryforwards  state net operating losses  and state tax credits  respectively and a  valuation allowance was provided on other state deferred tax assets for which we anticipate we will realize no benefit 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april  or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
in order to utilize the unreserved portion of our net operating loss carryforwards  the minimum level of annual taxable income that we would have to achieve must equal or exceed the amount of federal net operating carryforwards for fiscal through our management believes that achievement of that level of taxable income is more likely than not based on historical performance and future projections  including new product offerings  pricing decisions  marketing efforts and expected spending levels 
income from continuing operations the following table sets forth certain information regarding income from continuing operations and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands  except per share data change change income from continuing operations net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted fiscal income from continuing operations compared with fiscal income from continuing operations of million for fiscal was million higher than the million recorded for the prior fiscal year 
income from continuing operations increased primarily because of increased sales volumes and corresponding gross profit  as well as our new pricing and discount structure that resulted in improved profitability 
we also experienced less legal and consulting fees  and reduced interest expense  offset by increased employee costs related to improved profitability and the recall of our bolt action rifles 
net income per basic and diluted share from continuing operations for fiscal was favorably impacted by as a result of our repurchase of million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program 
fiscal income from continuing operations compared with fiscal income from continuing operations of million for fiscal was million higher than the million recorded in fiscal income from continuing operations increased primarily because of increased net sales volumes and corresponding gross profit 
we also experienced significantly less professional and consulting fees and realized the benefit of a lower tax rate through tax planning initiatives during fiscal

loss from discontinued operations was lower for fiscal due to reduced operating expenses from the completed divestiture of the business 
loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included a million non cash charge related to the expected loss on the sale of tangible and intangible assets 
loss from discontinued operations was lower for fiscal due to the inclusion of a million impairment charge related to goodwill and intangible assets that was recorded during fiscal in addition  fiscal included million of income associated with a reduction in contingent consideration for shares held for issuance to former stockholders in connection with our acquisition of swss 
excluding the loss on sale in fiscal  the adjusted loss would have been million 
excluding the impairment charge and the income from the valuation of contingent consideration  the adjusted loss for fiscal would have been million 
adjusted loss from discontinued operations was million higher for fiscal because of the significant reduction in sales and the related impact on gross margin along with additional severance costs associated with the planned divestiture of the business 
these reductions were partially offset by reduced operating expenses from cost cutting initiatives and a reduction in payroll and benefit costs resulting from lower headcount 
on july   we entered into an asset purchase agreement with futurenet group  inc or futurenet  providing for futurenet to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain of the liabilities of swss for a purchase price of million  including a  working capital adjustment 
in addition  we signed a licensing agreement with futurenet for the use of the swss trade name for a period of two years subsequent the sale 
during fiscal  we recognized  of licensing revenue relating to our licensing agreement with futurenet 
as noted above  we completed the disposition on july  in connection with the divestiture of swss  we sold net assets of million and incurred million in closing related costs  including  of legal  professional  and investment banking fees and  of severance and employee related costs 
during the years ended april  and  we recognized a loss on sale of the disposal group of million and million  respectively  which is included in net income 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our operations  including any potential acquisitions or investments  and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 

table of contents the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and dollars in thousands change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total operating activities operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
during fiscal  we generated million in cash from operating activities  an increase of million from the million of cash generated by operating activities in fiscal cash generated for fiscal was primarily because of a million increase in net income as well as a million increase in management incentive accruals 
cash provided by operating activities was unfavorably impacted by a million increase in inventory levels because of increased parts purchases related to capacity increases for our polymer pistol and long gun products 
cash provided by operating activities was also unfavorably impacted by million of reduced accrued other expenses  including reduced accruals for distributor incentives 
in addition  in fiscal  income tax payments were higher as a result of our higher taxable income 
cash flows from operating activities was lower in fiscal compared with fiscal because of an million reduction in accounts payable as we were able to pay down balances because of our cash position at year end  a million increase in inventories from increased production capacity and in preparation for a new product introduced late in fiscal  and a million decrease in accrued taxes other than income because of the timing of federal excise tax payments 
these reductions in operating activities were offset by a million reduction in accounts receivable because of our efforts to reduce the amount of time our sales remain in accounts receivable  a million reduction in income tax receivable related to the timing of income tax payments  and a million increase in accrued profit sharing from the increase in profitability from continuing operations 
investing activities cash used for investing activities increased by million for fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of increased capital spending of million over fiscal  partially offset by million received for the sale of our discontinued operations as noted above and million of proceeds from the sale of the land and building located in rochester  new hampshire 
major capital expenditures for fiscal relate to increasing capacity for existing products  improving production efficiencies  tooling for new product offerings  implementation of a new erp system  and various projects designed to upgrade manufacturing technology 
we have estimated that it will take million to complete our current construction in progress  including million of costs to complete our erp implementation 
cash used in investing activities was lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily because of a million reduction in capital spending compared with fiscal as we started to increase production capacity and had additional spending related to our edip refundable tax credit obligation late in fiscal this reduction was partially offset by  of proceeds from the sale of our foundry business 
financing activities cash used by financing activities was million for fiscal compared with million for fiscal the usage in fiscal primarily related to our stock repurchase program  as discussed below  under which we purchased million of our common stock in the open market utilizing cash on hand 
we also purchased million of our senior notes in the open market utilizing cash on hand and had million of senior notes outstanding on april  we paid  of interest relating to these purchases 
the purchases of our senior notes were offset by million of proceeds from exercise of options to

at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating million 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal included the repurchase of million of the convertible notes  million in cash paid for debt issue costs associated with the exchange of the convertible notes to senior notes late in fiscal  offset by proceeds of million in the form of a refundable tax credit received from the massachusetts economic development incentive program compared with fiscal  which included the net exchange of million of the convertible notes for senior notes 
during fiscal  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock  subject to certain conditions  in the open market or privately negotiated transactions on or prior to june  we repurchased  shares of our common stock during fiscal for million utilizing cash on hand leaving million of our common stock authorized to be purchased 
on may   our board authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock of which up to million was authorized for repurchase through a tender offer 
the remaining million  together with an amount unused in the tender offer  if any  was designated for repurchase of our common stock in the open market or privately negotiated transactions 
this million authorization replaces the stock repurchase program authorized in and is set to expire on or about june  we commenced the tender offer on june   to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the tender offer is scheduled to expire at midnight  new york city time  on the evening of july   subject to our right to extend offer 
we anticipate that we will obtain all of the funds necessary to purchase shares in the tender offer and to pay related fees and expenses through our available cash and cash equivalents 
at april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we had restricted cash totaling million as of april   of which million served as a compensating balance against our line of credit dated december  and  is related to the environmental remediation required to be performed in accordance with our credit facility with the td bank  na and the other lenders the lenders 
we have a million revolving line of credit with the lenders  with no balance outstanding as of april  during fiscal  we purchased million of senior notes in the open market utilizing cash on hand 
our credit agreement with the lenders contains financial covenants relating to maintaining maximum leverage and minimum debt service coverage 
the indenture relating to the senior notes contains a financial covenant relating to times interest earned 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of april  during june  we sold an aggregate of million of senior notes due to various qualified institutional buyers in exchange for approximately million of our outstanding senior notes from existing holders of such notes and the purchase by certain of such holders of additional senior notes for cash 
as a result of this transaction  our indebtedness increased by million and our debt service requirements increased by million per annum 
the senior notes were sold pursuant to the terms and conditions of an indenture and exchange and purchase agreements 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum payable on june and december of each year  beginning on december  at any time prior to june   we may  at our option  a upon not less than nor more than days prior notice  redeem all or a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the senior notes  plus an applicable premium  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date  or b redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the senior notes with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a redemption price of of the principal amount of the senior notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest as of the redemption date  provided that in the case of the foregoing clause  at least of the aggregate original principal amount of the senior notes remains outstanding  and the redemption occurs within days after the closing of the equity offering 
on and after june   we may  at our option  upon not less than nor more than days prior notice  redeem all or a portion of the senior notes at a redemption price of a of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  if redeemed during the month period beginning on june   or b of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed  if redeemed during the month 
table of contents period beginning on june   plus  in either case  accrued and unpaid interest on the senior notes as of the applicable redemption date 
subject to certain restrictions and conditions  we may be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes in connection with a change of control or disposition of assets 
if not redeemed by us or repaid pursuant to the holders right to require repurchase  the senior notes mature on june  based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans  the potential repurchase of million authorized under our stock repurchase plan  and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities  including the million senior notes sold during june  will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months  apart from major acquisitions 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including net sales  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and any acquisitions or strategic investments that we may determine to make 
further equity or debt financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if sufficient funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to take advantage of unexpected business opportunities or to respond to competitive pressures could be limited or severely constrained 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement dates and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
our significant estimates include accruals for warranty  product liability  workers compensation expense  environmental liability  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  income tax expense  including deferred tax asset valuation  forfeiture rates on stock based awards  and medical claims payable 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for our firearm products  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from our security solutions business has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
product sales account for most of our firearm revenue 
we recognize revenue from firearm product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment but could be delayed until customer acceptance is received 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize this revenue when accepted by the customer  if applicable  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectability is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenue for individual licensees based on historical experience and expected cash receipts from licensees 
licensing revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  most of this revenue is payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize non refundable license fees received upon initial signing of license 
table of contents agreements as revenue when no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensees products  and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectability does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not recognize minimum royalty payments upon contract signing  but instead record royalty revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to million 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  patents  trademarks  and trade names 
we amortize all finite lived intangible assets either on a straight line basis or based upon patterns in which we expect to utilize the economic benefits of such assets 
we initially determine the values of intangible assets by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we test intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis on february and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of asc with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review of the segment reporting topic  asc  we have determined that we operate our continuing operations in one reporting unit for our springfield  massachusetts and houlton  maine facilities 
as of april   we had no goodwill recorded on our books for continuing operations 
based on a combination of factors that occurred during fiscal  including federal and corporate budgetary constraints  increased price competition  low barrier to entry  and other factors  we determined that indicators for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets existed in our discontinued security solutions division and  as a result  we conducted an evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of that business 
based on the earnings and cash flow forecast for the next years  the fair value of this reporting unit was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
based on the work performed  we recorded a goodwill impairment loss related to our discontinued operations of million in fiscal we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
as noted above  economic and market conditions that affected our discontinued security solutions division required us to test for impairment of long lived assets pertaining to that business in fiscal based on that assessment  we recorded an impairment charge related to our discontinued operations of million to reflect the excess of the carrying value of long lived intangible

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro relative to the us dollar 
historically  we have had annual inventory purchases of million from a european supplier 
a portion of our gross sales during the three months and fiscal year ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross sales came from sales of goods that were purchased  in whole or in part  from a european manufacturer  in euros 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
at the end of fiscal  we ended our exclusive us importer and distributor agreement with this european supplier  however  we will continue to purchase from our european supplier in fiscal under the existing production rights agreement that will terminate at the end of fiscal we estimate that our inventory purchases in fiscal will be approximately million 
because of the planned reduction in our purchases to this european supplier in fiscal  a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would not be material to our business
