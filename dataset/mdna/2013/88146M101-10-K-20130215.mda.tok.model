table of contents overview we acquire  own and operate industrial real estate in six major coastal us markets los angeles  northern new jersey new york city  san francisco bay area  seattle  miami  and washington  dc baltimore 
we invest in several types of industrial real estate  including warehouse distribution approximately of our total portfolio square footage as of december   flex including light industrial and r d approximately and trans shipment approximately 
we target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate 
as of december   we owned buildings aggregating approximately million square feet  which we purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including the assumption of mortgage loans payable of approximately million  which includes mortgage premiums of approximately million 
we are an internally managed maryland corporation and elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  our investment strategy we invest in industrial properties in six major coastal us markets los angeles  northern new jersey new york city  san francisco bay area  seattle  miami  and washington  dc baltimore 
we invest in several types of industrial real estate  including warehouse distribution  flex including light industrial and r d and trans shipment 
we target functional buildings in infill locations that may be shared by multiple tenants and that cater to customer demand within the various submarkets in which we operate 
we selected our target markets by drawing upon the experiences of our management team investing and operating in over global industrial markets located in north america  europe and asia and in anticipation of trends in logistics patterns resulting from population changes  regulatory and physical constraints  potential long term increases in carbon prices and other factors 
we believe that our target markets have attractive long term investment attributes 
we target assets with characteristics that include  but are not limited to  the following located in high population coastal markets  close proximity to transportation infrastructure such as sea ports  airports  highways and railways  situated in supply constrained submarkets with barriers to new industrial development  as a result of physical and or regulatory constraints  functional and flexible layout that can be modified to accommodate single and multiple tenants  acquisition price at a discount to the replacement cost of the property  potential for enhanced return through re tenanting or operational and physical improvements  and opportunity for higher and better use of the property over time 
in general  we prefer to utilize local third party property managers for day to day property management and as a source of acquisition opportunities 
we believe outsourcing property management is cost effective and provides us with operational flexibility 
we currently manage one of our properties directly and may directly manage other properties in the future if we determine such direct property management is in our best interest 
we have no current intention to acquire undeveloped industrial land or to pursue ground up development 
however  we may pursue redevelopment opportunities of properties that we own 
we expect that we will continue to acquire the significant majority of our investments as equity interests in individual properties or portfolios of properties 
we may also acquire industrial properties through the acquisition of other corporations or entities that own industrial real estate 
we will opportunistically target investments in debt secured by industrial real estate that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying real estate 
we currently do not intend to target specific percentages of holdings of particular types of industrial properties 
this expectation is based upon prevailing market conditions and may change over time in response to different prevailing market conditions 
the properties we acquire may be stabilized fully leased or unstabilized have near term lease expirations or be partially or fully vacant 
during the period from february  to december   we acquired unstabilized properties of which have been stabilized 
in addition  we have disposed of one property 
we may sell properties from time to time when we believe the prospective total return from a property is particularly low relative to its market value and or the market value of the property is significantly greater than its estimated replacement cost 
capital from such sales will be reinvested into properties that are expected to provide better prospective returns or returned to shareholders

tenant default on january   we filed an eviction proceeding against banah international group  our tenant at th avenue located in hialeah  fl  for failure to pay december and january rent 
as a result  we incurred charges during the year ended december  of approximately  related to the bad debt reserve of outstanding accounts receivable  approximately million related to the write off of deferred rent receivable and approximately million related to the write off of capitalized leasing commissions  net of deferred lease commissions payable 
as of december   banah international group represented approximately of our annualized base rent 
any ultimate recovery of damages  including past due rent  is undetermined at this time 
we currently expect that the rental rates we are likely to achieve on any new leases for this space will generally be equal to or above the rental rates under the lease with banah international group 
we cannot provide assurance  however  that the space will be re leased at all or at rental rates equal to or above the current rental rate 
contractual commitments currently we have three contracts with third party sellers to acquire three industrial properties as described under the heading contractual obligations in this annual report on form k 
there is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence and various closing conditions 
outlook industrial rents have stopped falling in our markets and in most cases are rising modestly 
nevertheless  with national availability likely ending near and new speculative development beginning in some markets  it will take time before most markets exhibit significant rent growth 
we see a growing set of acquisition opportunities 
in the intermediate term we expect to grow our portfolio to optimize our operating efficiency  increase our shareholder liquidity and position us to achieve an investment grade credit rating to broaden our access to capital 
we remain mindful  however  that it is per share  rather than aggregate  results that matter 
we believe in the long term operating prospects of our functional  infill coastal assets 
we believe in sound balance sheet management 
we believe in the benefits of our market leading corporate governance and exceptionally aligned executive management compensation 
the primary source of our operating revenues and earnings is rents received from tenants under operating leases at our properties  including reimbursements from tenants for certain operating costs 
we seek long term earnings growth primarily through increasing rents and operating income at existing properties and acquiring properties in our six target markets 
we intend to seek to grow our portfolio by utilizing one or more of cash on hand  future borrowings under our credit facility  future sales of common or preferred equity and future placements of secured or unsecured debt 
in the first two months of  we have amended our credit facility and entered into three contracts to acquire three industrial properties  all as described in this annual report on form k 
inflation although the us economy has been experiencing relatively modest inflation rates recently  and a wide variety of industries and sectors are affected differently by changing commodity prices  inflation has not had a significant impact on us in our markets of operation 
most of our leases require the tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
in addition  approximately our current leases expire within five years which enables us to seek to replace existing leases with new leases at the then existing market rate 

table of contents financial condition and results of operations we derive substantially all of our revenues from rents received from tenants under existing leases on each of our properties 
these revenues include fixed base rents and recoveries of certain property operating expenses that we have incurred and that we pass through to the individual tenants 
approximately of our leased space includes fixed rental increases or consumer price index based rental increases 
lease terms typically range from three to ten years 
our primary cash expenses consist of our property operating expenses  which include real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance  management expenses  insurance  utilities  general and administrative expenses  which include compensation costs  office expenses  professional fees and other administrative expenses  acquisition costs  which include third party costs paid to brokers and consultants  and interest expense  primarily on mortgage loans and our facility 
our consolidated results of operations often are not comparable from period to period due to the impact of property acquisitions at various times during the course of such periods 
the results of operations of any acquired property are included in our financial statements as of the date of its acquisition 
the analysis of our results below for the years ended december  and includes the changes attributable to same store properties

as of december   the same store pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately million square feet 
as of december   the non same store properties  which we acquired or disposed of during the course of and  consisted of properties aggregating approximately million square feet 
our future financial condition and results of operations  including rental revenues  straight line rents and amortization of lease intangibles  may be impacted by the acquisitions of additional properties  and expenses may vary materially from historical results

revenues 
total revenues increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
approximately million  net of approximately million due to the write off related to the tenant default  of this increase is from same store revenues mainly due to increased occupancy  as same store consolidated occupancy at year end increased to as of december  as compared to from the same period in the remaining increase in total revenues is due to property acquisitions during and for the quarter and year ended december   approximately million and million  respectively was recorded in straight line rental revenues related to contractual rent abatements given to certain tenants

acquisition costs increased by approximately million for the year ended december  from the prior year due to a higher volume of property acquisitions during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
interest expense  including amortization 
interest expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year due primarily to the assumption and origination of mortgage loans payable during and  as well as borrowings under our facility and term loan payable 
comparison of the year ended december  to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  the majority of the changes in our statements of operations line items for the year ended december  compared to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  are related to property acquisitions that occurred at various times during the course of and in addition  certain of such changes were the result of consisting of a full year of operations compared to consisting of a shorter operating period

general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase was driven primarily by our having a full year of expenses for the year ended december  compared to the shorter period from february  commencement of operations to december  acquisition costs 
acquisition costs decreased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this decrease is due to a lower volume of property acquisitions during the year ended december  compared to the period from february  commencement of operations to december  interest expense  including amortization 
interest expense increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  this increase is due primarily to the assumption of million in mortgage loans payable during and  as well as borrowings on our facility and term loan payable in liquidity and capital resources the primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain financial flexibility with a conservative capital structure using retained cash flows  long term debt and the issuance of common and perpetual preferred stock to finance our growth 
over the long term  we intend to limit the sum of the outstanding principal amount of our consolidated indebtedness and the liquidation preference of any outstanding perpetual preferred stock to less than of our total enterprise value  maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio in excess of x  limit the principal amount of our outstanding floating rate debt to less than of our total consolidated indebtedness  and have staggered debt maturities that are aligned to our expected average lease term years  positioning us to re price parts of our capital structure as our rental rates change with market conditions 

table of contents we intend to preserve a flexible capital structure with a long term goal to obtain an investment grade rating and be in a position to issue unsecured debt and additional perpetual preferred stock 
prior to attaining an investment grade rating  we intend to primarily utilize non recourse debt secured by individual properties or pools of properties with a targeted maximum loan to value of at the time of financing  or recourse bank term loans  credit facilities and perpetual preferred stock 
we may also assume debt in connection with property acquisitions which may have a higher loan to value 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through net cash provided by operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our facility 
we believe that our net cash provided by operations will be adequate to fund operating requirements  pay interest on any borrowings and fund distributions in accordance with the reit requirements of the federal income tax laws 
in the near term  we intend to fund future investments in properties with term loans  mortgages  borrowings under our facility  perpetual preferred and common stock issuance and  from time to time  property sales 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including with respect to other investments in industrial properties  property acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through borrowings under our facility  periodic issuances of common stock  perpetual preferred stock  and long term secured and unsecured debt  and with proceeds from the disposition of properties

net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consists primarily of million in net common and preferred stock issuance proceeds and borrowings on mortgage loans and the facility of approximately million  less payments on the facility and term loan of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which consists primarily of approximately million of borrowings on the facility and term loan  less million in deferred underwriting fee payments  million of payments on the facility and million in dividend payments 
critical accounting policies below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we believe are critical 
we consider these policies critical because they require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  involve various assumptions and require significant management judgment  and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
these judgments will affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
applying different estimates or assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in our financial statements 
property acquisitions 
upon acquisition of a property  which are accounted for as business combinations  we estimate the fair value of acquired tangible assets consisting generally of land  buildings and improvements and intangible assets and liabilities consisting generally of the above and below market leases and the origination value of all in place leases 
we determine fair values using replacement cost  estimated cash flow projections and other valuation techniques and applying appropriate discount and capitalization rates based on available market information 
mortgage loans assumed in connection with acquisitions are recorded at their fair value using current market interest rates for similar debt at the date of acquisition 
acquisition related costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred 
the fair value of the tangible assets is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
land values are derived from current comparative sales values  when available  or management s estimates of the fair value based on market conditions and the experience of our management team 
building and improvement values are calculated as replacement cost less depreciation  or management s estimates of the fair value of these assets using discounted cash flows analyses or similar methods 
the fair value of the above and below market leases is based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amounts to be received pursuant to the acquired leases using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases and our estimate of the market lease rates measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the leases plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options 
the above and below market lease values are amortized to rental revenues over the remaining initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options that are considered bargain renewal options of the respective leases 
the origination value of in place leases is based on costs to execute similar leases including commissions and other related costs 
the origination value of in place leases also includes real estate taxes  insurance and an estimate of lost rent revenue at market rates during the estimated time required to lease up the property from vacant to the occupancy level at the date of acquisition 

table of contents impairment 
carrying values for financial reporting purposes are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be fully recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances may include classifying an asset to be held for sale  changing the intended hold period or when an asset remains vacant significantly longer than expected 
the intended use of an asset either held for sale or held for use can significantly impact how impairment is measured 
if an asset is intended to be held for the long term  the recoverability is based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if the asset carrying value is not supported on an undiscounted future cash flow basis  then the asset carrying value is measured against the lower of cost or the present value of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
an impairment charge to earnings is recognized for the excess of the asset s carrying value over the lower of cost or the present values of expected cash flows over the expected hold period 
if an asset is intended to be sold  impairment is determined using the estimated fair value less costs to sell 
the estimation of expected future net cash flows is inherently uncertain and relies on assumptions  among other things  regarding current and future economic and market conditions and the availability of capital 
we determine the estimated fair values based on its assumptions regarding rental rates  lease up and holding periods  as well as sales prices 
when available  current market information is used to determine capitalization and rental growth rates 
if available  current comparative sales values may also be used to establish fair value 
when market information is not readily available  the inputs are based on our understanding of market conditions and the experience of our management team 
actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
the discount rates used in the fair value estimates represent a rate commensurate with the indicated holding period with a premium layered on for risk 
revenue recognition 
we record rental revenue from operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the leases and maintains an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if tenants fail to make contractual lease payments that are greater than our allowance for doubtful accounts  security deposits and letters of credit  then we may have to recognize additional doubtful account charges in future periods 
we monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an on going basis by reviewing their financial condition periodically as appropriate 
each period we review our outstanding accounts receivable  including straight line rents  for doubtful accounts and provide allowances as needed 
we also record lease termination fees when a tenant has executed a definitive termination agreement with us and the payment of the termination fee is not subject to any conditions that must be met or waived before the fee is due to us 
if a tenant remains in the leased space following the execution of a definitive termination agreement  the applicable termination will be deferred and recognized over the term of such tenant s occupancy 
income taxes 
we elected to be taxed as a reit under the code and operate as such beginning with our taxable year ended december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with gaap 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute qualifying dividends to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a reit for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the irs grants us relief under certain statutory provisions 
such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders 
however  we believe we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a reit 
stock based compensation and other long term incentive compensation 
we follow the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation  to account for our stock based compensation plan  which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that the cost be measured on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we have adopted the equity plan  which provides for the grant of restricted stock awards  performance share awards  unrestricted shares or any combination of the foregoing 
stock based compensation is recognized as a general and administrative expense in the financial statements and measured at the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience as well as expected behavior 
the amount of the expense may be subject to adjustment in future periods depending on the specific characteristics of the stock based award 
in addition  we have awarded long term incentive target awards to our executives that are payable in shares of our common stock after the conclusion of each pre established performance measurement period 
the amount that may be earned under the long term incentive plan is variable depending on the relative total shareholder return of our stock as compared to the total shareholder return of the msci us reit index and the ftse nareit equity industrial index over the pre established performance measurement period 
we estimate the fair value of the long term incentive target awards using a monte carlo simulation model on the date of grant and at each reporting period 
these awards are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite performance period based on the fair value of the award at the balance sheet date 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations currently we have three outstanding contracts with third party sellers to acquire three industrial properties 
there is no assurance that we will acquire the properties under contract because the proposed acquisitions are subject to the completion of satisfactory due diligence and various closing conditions 
the following table summarizes certain information with respect to the properties we have under contract market number of buildings square feet purchase price in thousands assumed debt in thousands los angeles miami northern new jersey new york city san francisco bay area seattle washington  dc baltimore total the following table summarizes our contractual obligations due by period as of december  dollars in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years more than years total debt debt interest payments operating lease commitments purchase obligations total non gaap financial measures we use the following non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as a key supplemental measure of our operating performance funds from operations  or ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  net operating income  or noi  same store noi and cash basis same store noi 
ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  noi  same store noi and cash basis same store noi should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
further  our computation of ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  noi  same store noi and cash basis same store noi may not be comparable to ffo  ebitda  adjusted ebitda  noi  same store noi and cash basis same store noi reported by other companies 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that presenting ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we believe that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of our operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient 
as a result  we believe that the use of ffo  together with the required gaap presentations  provide a more complete understanding of our operating performance

table of contents we compute ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  gains losses from sales of property and depreciation and amortization 
we compute adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  gains losses from sales of property  depreciation and amortization  acquisition costs and stock based compensation 
we believe that presenting ebitda and adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because they are measures of our operations on an unleveraged basis before the effects of tax  non cash depreciation and amortization expense and acquisition costs and stock based compensation with regard to adjusted ebitda 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow investors to measure our operating performance independent of our capital structure and indebtedness and  therefore  allow for more meaningful comparison of our operating performance between quarters as well as annual periods and for the comparison of our operating performance to that of other companies  both in the real estate industry and in other industries 
as we are currently in a growth phase  acquisition costs are excluded from adjusted ebitda to allow for the comparison of our operating performance to that of stabilized companies 
the following table reflects the calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda reconciled from net income loss for the three months ended december   and and for the years ended december  and and for the period from february  commencement of operations to december  dollars in thousands for the three months ended december  for the three months ended december  change change change change net income loss   n a gain on sales of real estate investments   n a n a depreciation and amortization from continuing operations depreciation related to discontinued operations n a interest expense  including amortization ebitda stock based compensation acquisition costs adjusted ebitda for the year ended december  for the year ended december  period from february  commencement of operations to december  change change change change net income loss    n a  gain on sales of real estate investments   n a n a depreciation and amortization from continuing operations depreciation related to discontinued operations interest expense  including amortization ebitda   n a stock based compensation acquisition costs adjusted ebitda  n a we compute noi as rental revenues  including tenant expense reimbursements  less property operating expenses

the same store pool includes all properties that were owned as of december  and since january  and excludes properties that were either disposed of or held for sale to a third party 
as of december   the same store pool consisted of properties aggregating approximately million square feet 
we believe that presenting noi  same store noi and cash basis same store noi provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance of our properties because noi excludes certain items that are not considered to be controllable in connection with the management of the property  such as depreciation  amortization  general and administrative expenses  acquisition costs and interest expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk which we are exposed to is interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand our investment portfolio and operations 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
as described below  some of our outstanding debt bears interest at variable rates  and we expect that some of our future outstanding debt will have variable interest rates 
we may use interest rate caps to manage our interest rate risks relating to our variable rate debt 
we expect to replace variable rate debt on a regular basis with fixed rate  long term debt to finance our assets and operations 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our facility 
amounts borrowed under our facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor plus an applicable libor margin  which interest rate was as of december  if the libor rate fluctuates by  interest expense would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by approximately  annually on the total of the outstanding balances on our facility as of december
