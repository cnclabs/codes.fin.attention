item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  patent and trademark laws and on contractual restrictions to establish and protect proprietary rights in our technologies and fonts 
whenever possible  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our suppliers  partners and others to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information 
we apply for us and international patents with respect to our technologies  and seek copyright registration of our software and us and international trademark registration in those instances which we determine are competitively advantageous and cost effective to do so 
we have been granted a total of patents and have patents pending with the us patent and trademark office 
some of our most important patents are related to our subpixel rendering technology  our act tm compression technology and dynamic subsetting technology 
we have unregistered trademarks and  where appropriate  registered trademarks on the key fonts in our font libraries 
we intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark rights 

table of contents some of our fonts are owned by third parties that we license under exclusive or non exclusive agreements 
we have also collaborated with third parties in the production and development of fonts 
competition our solutions compete with those offered by a variety of companies  including vendors of print and screen imaging technologies  printer drivers and design tools  as well as designers and distributors of fonts 
we compete principally on the basis of our technical innovation  engineering and customer support expertise  the breadth of our font offerings and the overall performance of our solutions  including reliability and timely delivery 
competition with our solutions comes from a variety of sources  including companies that license technologies and fonts  such as adobe  and local providers of solutions that are specific to a particular country s language requirements  such as morisawa in japan 
we also compete with open source fonts and technologies  including freetype  which is an open source collaborative organization that provides its linux font rendering code for free  and google  which provides open source fonts 
in addition  we compete with printer driver provider software imaging  pdl provider zoran and font management software vendors extensis and insider software 
the competition for our custom font design services generally comes from companies offering their own type libraries and custom type services  including boutique font foundries and independent professionals 
we also compete with in house resources of our oem customers 
employees and consultants at december   we employed persons 
in addition  we have an exclusive relationship with a consulting firm that provides font design and production services in china 
the table below provides our employees by functional area 
number of employees percentage sales and marketing research and development general and administration total none of our employees or consultants is represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
our linotype employees are represented by a works council 
this works council has the right to participate in certain decisions by linotype  including operational changes  such as relocation of the business or change of control transactions  and social matters such as wages and salaries and working hours 
we believe that our relations with our employees and consultants are good 
segment information information concerning revenue from our two principal markets for the last three years may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not allocate expenses and assets to our two principal markets  creative professional and oem  and operating results are assessed on an aggregate basis to make decisions about the allocation of resources 
further information about our principal markets and segment information  including geographic revenue  may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements

risks related to our customers and our customer relationships we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from a limited number of licensees  and if we are unable to maintain these customer relationships or attract additional customers  our revenue will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from the licensing of our type and technologies to oems 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
accordingly  if we are unable to maintain these relationships or establish relationships with new customers  our licensing revenue will be adversely affected 
in addition  some of our license agreements are for a limited period of time and  upon expiration of their license agreements  these oems may not renew their agreements or may elect not to enter into new agreements with us on terms as favorable as our current agreements 
if hewlett packard or adobe were to discontinue their use of our solutions in their products  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
because of their market position as industry leaders  the incorporation by hewlett packard  or hp  of our solutions in its laser printers and the incorporation of our solutions by adobe in its postscript product promote widespread adoption of our technologies by manufacturers seeking to maintain compatibility with hp and adobe 
if hp or adobe were to stop using our solutions in their products  the market acceptance of our technologies by other ce device manufacturers would be materially and adversely affected  and this would in turn adversely affect our revenue 
we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees and  to the extent we lower them in the future  our revenue may be adversely affected 
the ce device markets are highly competitive and ce device manufacturers are continually looking for ways to reduce the costs of components included in their products in order to maintain or broaden 
table of contents consumer acceptance of those products 
because our type and technologies are a component incorporated into ce devices  when negotiating renewals of customer contracts  we face pressure from our customers to lower our license fees 
in addition  our creative professional business is increasingly comprised of recurring revenue  including saas subscription based licensing models 
we have in the past  and may in the future  need to lower our recurring license fees  either immediately or over time  to preserve customer relationships or extend use of our type or technologies 
to the extent contractual license fees for any particular customer are lower in the future  we cannot be certain that we will be able to achieve related increases in the use of our technologies or other benefits to fully offset the effects of these adjustments 
if we are unable to further penetrate our existing markets or adapt or develop our type or technologies  our business prospects could be limited 
in our creative professional business  we expect that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully penetrate both the desktop and digital publishing markets through our relationships with our e commerce  business enterprise  agency and publishing customers 
to date  we have penetrated only some of these markets 
in our oem business  we expect that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to successfully penetrate existing markets for ce devices  including laser printers  digital copiers  mobile phones  e book readers  tablets  automotive displays  digital cameras  navigation devices  digital televisions  set top boxes and consumer appliances 
our ability to grow our revenue depends upon our ability to further penetrate these markets and to successfully penetrate those markets in which we currently have no presence 
demand for our solutions in any of these developing markets may not develop or grow  and a sufficiently broad base of creative professional and oem customers may not adopt or continue to use products that employ our solutions 
because of our limited experience in some of these markets  we may not be able to adequately adapt our business and our solutions to the needs of these customers 
our success depends on the existence of a market for ce devices that incorporate our type and technologies 
our revenue depends in large part on market demand for solutions that enable ce devices to render high quality text 
the ce device market is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and needs  and frequent new platform and product introductions 
if the need for laser printers and other ce devices utilizing our technology were to decrease or if current models of these products were replaced by new or existing products for which we do not have a competitive solution or if our solutions are replaced by others that become the industry standard and we are not able to develop technologies to build on such industry standards  our customers may not purchase our solutions and our revenue would be adversely affected 
for example  if graphical device interface  or gdi  printers increased their already dominant position and replaced more page description language  or pdl  printers  our revenue would be adversely affected 
similarly  if the android platform  for example  increases market share in the mobile phone industry and we are not able to develop additional solutions to build on such platform  our revenue would be adversely affected 
the market for laser printers is a mature market growing at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
to the extent that sales of laser printers level off or decline  our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 
a significant portion of our revenue in  and was derived from laser printer manufacturers 
the laser printer market is a mature market and as a result  it has grown at a slower rate than other markets in which we operate 
in both and  the laser printer market experienced a decline and our revenue was adversely affected 
if sales of printers incorporating our solutions level off  or decline  then our licensing revenue may be adversely affected 

table of contents our licensing revenue depends in large part upon oems incorporating our type and technologies into their products  and if our solutions are not incorporated in these products or fewer products are sold that incorporate our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our licensing revenue from oems depends upon the extent to which these oems embed our type and technologies in their products 
we do not control their decision whether or not to embed our solutions into their products  and we do not control their product development or commercialization efforts 
if we fail to develop and offer solutions that adequately or competitively address the needs of the changing marketplace  oems may not be willing to embed our solutions into their products 
the process utilized by oems to design  develop  produce and sell their products is generally to months in duration 
as a result  if an oem is unwilling or unable to embed our solutions into a product that it is manufacturing or developing  we may experience significant delays in generating revenue while we wait for that oem to begin development of a new product that may embed our solutions 
in addition  if oems sell fewer products incorporating our solutions  our revenue will be adversely affected 
our operating results may fluctuate based upon an increase or decrease of market share by ce device manufacturers to whom we license our type or technologies 
the terms of our license agreements with our ce device manufacturers vary 
for example  we have fixed fee licensing agreements with certain customers  some of which may decline over time 
if these customers  some of whom are instrumental in setting industry standards and influencing early adoption of platforms or technology incorporating our solutions  were to increase their share of the ce device market  under the terms of these agreements there would not be a corresponding increase in our revenue 
any change in the market share of ce device manufacturers to whom we license our type or technologies is entirely outside of our control 
risks related to our type  technology and expertise if we fail to develop and deliver innovative type and technologies in response to changes in our industry  including changes in consumer tastes or trends  our revenue could decline 
the markets for our type  technology and expertise are characterized by rapid change and technological evolution and are intensely competitive and price sensitive 
our future success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to develop and deliver innovative type and technologies that are widely adopted in response to changes in our industry  that are compatible with the solutions introduced by other participants in our industry and for which our customers are willing to pay competitive prices 
we rely on the introduction of new or expanded solutions with additional or enhanced features and functionality to allow us to maintain our value in the face of downward pressure on our pricing resulting from efforts by our creative professional and oem customers to reduce costs 
we may not correctly identify new or changing market trends at an early enough stage to capitalize on market opportunities 
for example  our customers are participating in an increasingly global marketplace and we need to ensure our global type offering and related technologies meet these needs 
our failure to deliver such innovative type and technologies that allow us to stay competitive and for which we can maintain our pricing would adversely affect our revenue 
open source software may make us more vulnerable to competition because new market entrants and existing competitors could introduce similar products quickly and cheaply 
open source refers to the free sharing of software code used to build applications in the software development community 
individual programmers may modify and create derivative works and distribute them at no cost to the end user 
to the extent that open source software that has the same or similar 
table of contents functionality as our technologies is developed or gains market share  demand for our technologies may decline  we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our technologies and our results of operations may be negatively affected 
in addition  open source type software has become more widely available and to the extent such type is widely adopted  the demand for our type offerings may decrease and our revenue could be adversely affected 
current and future industry standards may limit our business opportunities 
various industry leaders have adopted or are in the process of adopting standards for ce devices that incorporate  or have the potential to incorporate  our technologies 
in addition  standards applicable to web based development and distribution  such as web publishing platforms  are evolving 
although we have made some efforts  where applicable  to have our solutions adopted as standards by industry market leaders  these efforts have been limited and we do not control the ultimate decision with respect to whether our solutions will be adopted as industry standards in the future or  to the extent they are adopted  whether and for how long they will continue as such 
if industry standards adopted exclude our solutions or we are unable to be compatible with such adopted solutions  we will lose market share and our ability to secure the business of customers subject to those standards will be adversely affected 
costs or potential delays in the development of our solutions to comply with such standards could significantly increase our expenses and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to others who comply faster or in a more cost efficient way or those whose solutions are adopted as the industry standard 
we may also need to acquire or license additional intellectual property rights from third parties which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  and we may be required to license our intellectual property to third parties for purposes of standards compliance 
the success of our business is influenced by the interoperability of our solutions with a variety of ce devices and software applications and operating systems 
to be successful we must design our type and technologies to interoperate effectively with a variety of ce devices  software applications  operating systems and content creation platforms 
we depend on the cooperation of ce device manufacturers with respect to the components integrated into their devices  such as pdls  as well as software developers that create the operating systems and applications  to incorporate our solutions into their product offerings 
content creation platforms are evolving rapidly 
to the extent our fonts and font technologies are less relevant  or incompatible  our business would be adversely affected 
our type and technologies compete with solutions offered by some of our customers  which have significant competitive advantages 
we face competitive risks in situations where our customers are also current or potential competitors 
for example  adobe is a significant licensee of our fonts  but adobe is also a competitor with respect to the licensing of technologies and fonts 
to the extent that adobe or our other customers choose to utilize competing solutions they have developed or in which they have an interest  rather than utilizing our solutions  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
adobe also offers broader product lines than we do  including software products outside of the type markets that provide adobe with greater opportunities to bundle and cross sell products to its large user base 
to the extent our customers were to offer type or technologies comparable to ours at a similar or lower price  our revenue could decline and our business would be harmed 
our business is dependent in part on type and technologies we license from third parties and these license rights may be inadequate for our business 
certain of our solutions are dependent in part on the licensing and incorporation of technologies from third parties  and we license a substantial number of fonts from third parties 
for example  we have entered into license agreements with agfa gevaert nv under which we have acquired rights to use 
table of contents certain color technology 
we also have license agreements with microsoft  adobe and others under which we license certain fonts  and our e commerce sites  including myfonts  rely upon the license of type from third parties 
our license agreements with these parties are limited by the ownership or licensing rights of our licensors 
if any of the technologies we license from third parties fail to perform as expected  if our licensors do not continue to support any of their technology or intellectual property  including fonts  because they go out of business or otherwise  or if the technologies or fonts we license are subject to infringement claims  then we may incur substantial costs in replacing the licensed technologies or fonts or fall behind in our development schedule and our business plan while we search for a replacement 
in addition  replacement technology and fonts may not be available for license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  which could subject us to claims by our customers for breach of the terms of our agreements with them 
our business and prospects depend on the strength of our brands  and if we do not maintain and strengthen our brands  we may be unable to maintain or expand our business 
maintaining and strengthening the brand of the monotype libraries and our other brands is critical to maintaining and expanding our business  as well as to our ability to enter into new markets for our type  technology and expertise 
if we fail to promote and maintain these brands successfully  our ability to sustain and expand our business and enter into new markets will suffer 
maintaining and strengthening our brands will depend heavily on our ability to continue to develop and provide innovative and high quality solutions for our customers  as well as to continue to maintain our strong online presence and relationships with third party type and technology providers 
for example  we will need to ensure our type and technologies are as relevant for the evolving digital publishing needs of our creative professional customers 
if we fail to adapt to changing consumer preferences or if we introduce solutions that our customers or potential customers reject  the strength of our brands could be adversely affected 
further  unauthorized third parties may use our brands in ways that may dilute or undermine their strength 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property  we could lose our intellectual property rights  which could negatively affect our revenue or dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
our success is heavily dependent upon our ability to protect our intellectual property which includes our type and technologies 
to protect our intellectual property  we rely on a combination of united states and international patents  design registrations  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret restrictions  eulas  and the implementation and enforcement of nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
despite these efforts  we may be unable to effectively protect our proprietary rights and the enforcement of our proprietary rights may be extremely costly 
for example  our ability to enforce intellectual property rights in the actual design of our fonts is limited 
we hold patents related to certain of our rasterizer and compression technologies and registered trademarks on many of our fonts 
our patents may be challenged or invalidated  patents may not issue from any of our pending applications or claims allowed from existing or pending patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength or may not issue in the countries where products incorporating our technology may be sold to provide meaningful protection or be of any commercial advantage to us 
some of our patents have been and or may be licensed or cross licensed to our competitors 
we rely on trademark protection for the names of our fonts 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and distribute our proprietary technologies and fonts 
also  many applications do not need to identify our fonts by name  such as those designs embedded in mobile telephones and set top boxes  and therefore may not need to license trademarked fonts 
we sometimes protect fonts by copyright registration but we do not always own the copyrights in fonts licensed from third parties 
in addition  we cannot be certain that we will be able to enforce our copyrights against a third party who independently develops fonts even if it generates font designs identical to ours 

table of contents our eula generally permits the embedding of our fonts into an electronic document only for the purpose of viewing and printing the document  but technologies  including those related to web based fonts  may exist or may develop which allow unauthorized persons who receive such an embedded document to use the embedded font for editing the document or even to install the font into an operating system  the same as if the font had been properly licensed 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property or copying of our fonts may dilute or undermine the strength of our brands 
also  we may be unable to generate revenue from products that incorporate our type or technologies without our authorization 
monitoring unauthorized use of our solutions is difficult and expensive 
a substantial portion of the ce devices that require type or related technologies are manufactured in china 
we cannot be certain that the steps we take to prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property will be effective  particularly in countries like china where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be forced to litigate to defend our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims by third parties against us relating to intellectual property rights 
disputes and litigation regarding the ownership of technologies and fonts and rights associated with solutions such as ours are common  and sometimes involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence 
third parties have from time to time claimed  and in the future may claim  that our products and services infringe or violate their intellectual property rights 
any such claims could cause us to incur significant expenses and  if successfully asserted against us  could require that we pay substantial damages and prevent us from selling our products 
we may be forced to litigate to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of other parties proprietary rights 
even if we were to prevail  any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
we may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners pursuant to any such litigation  which could further exhaust our resources 
furthermore  as a result of an intellectual property challenge  we may be required to enter into royalty  license or other agreements  and we may not be able to obtain such agreements at all or on terms acceptable to us 
we have been in the past involved in litigation with third parties  including adobe  to defend our intellectual property rights and have not always prevailed 
certain component technologies in our solutions may be subject to open source licenses  which may restrict how we use or distribute our technologies or require that we release the source code of certain technologies subject to those licenses 
certain open source licenses  such as the gnu lesser general public license  require that source code subject to the license be released or made available to the public 
such open source licenses typically mandate that proprietary technologies  when combined in specific ways with open source software  become subject to the open source license 
we take steps to ensure that our proprietary technologies are not combined with  or do not incorporate  open source software in ways that would require our proprietary technologies to be subject to an open source license 
however  few courts have interpreted the open source licenses  and the manner in which these licenses may be interpreted and enforced is therefore subject to uncertainty 
while our end user license agreement  or eula  prohibits the use of our technologies in any way that would cause them to become subject to an open source license  our customers could  in violation of our eula  combine our technologies with technologies covered by an open source license 
in addition  we rely on multiple software engineers to design our proprietary technologies 
although we take steps to ensure that our engineers do not include open source software in the technologies they design  we may not exercise complete control over the product development efforts of our engineers and we cannot be certain that they have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary technologies 
in the event that portions of our proprietary technologies are determined to be subject to an 
table of contents open source license  we might be required to publicly release the affected portions of our source code  which could reduce or eliminate our ability to commercialize our solutions 
also  our ability to market our type and technologies depends in part on the existence of proprietary operating systems 
if freely distributed operating systems like linux become more prevalent  the need for our solutions may diminish and our revenue could be adversely affected 
finally  in the event we develop technologies that operate under or are delivered under an open source license  such technologies may have little or no direct financial benefit to us 
risks related to our business operations a prolonged economic downturn could materially harm our business 
our ability to generate revenue is affected by the level of business activity of our creative professional and oem customers  which  in most cases  is affected by the level of economic activity occurring in the industries and markets that our customers serve 
negative trends in the general economy  including trends resulting from a recession  the availability of credit  actual or threatened military action by the united states  terrorist attacks on the united states or abroad  or increased oil prices  could cause a decrease in consumer and or business spending on computer hardware and software  and ce devices in general  and could negatively affect the rate of growth of ce device markets or of adoption of ce devices 
any economic downturn  including a reduction in consumer confidence or disposable income in general  could also adversely affect the demand for fonts or impair the ability of our customers to pay for products and services that they have purchased 
we cannot predict the timing  strength or duration of any economic slowdown or subsequent economic recovery and this uncertainty makes it difficult to determine if past experience is a good guide to the future 
if the general economy or markets in which we operate worsen from present levels  the demand for fonts and font technologies could decline  and our revenue and profitability could be materially and adversely impacted 
software licensing models are evolving and if we are not able to make our fonts and font technologies available under these models  our business prospects could suffer 
new licensing and business models are evolving in the software industry 
for example  a company may provide software applications  data and related services over the internet  using primarily advertising or saas revenue models 
recent advances in computing and communications technologies  and specifically a growth in the demand for web based fonts that integrate seamlessly with all web browsers and operating systems  have made this model viable 
as software licensing models evolve  we may not be successful in adapting to these new business models and our business prospects could suffer 
we face significant competition in various markets  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer 
we face significant competition in the market for type and related technologies 
we believe that our most significant competitive threat comes from companies that compete with some of our specific offerings 
those competitors currently include adobe  software imaging  extensis  insider software  freetype and local providers of solutions whose products are specific to a particular country s language 
we also compete with the internal resources of our customers to whom we license our solutions  most of which have greater financial  technical and other resources than we do 
similarly  we also face competition from font foundries  font related websites and independent professionals 
some of our current or future competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do  may enjoy greater name recognition than we do or may have more experience or advantages than we have in the markets in which they compete 
these advantages may include  among others sales and marketing advantages  advantages in the recruitment and retention of skilled personnel  
table of contents advantages in the establishment and negotiation of profitable strategic  distribution and customer relationships  advantages in the development and acquisition of innovative software technology and the acquisition of software companies  greater ability to pursue larger scale product development and distribution initiatives on a global basis  substantially larger patent portfolios  and operational advantages 
further  many of the devices that incorporate our solutions also include technologies and fonts developed by our competitors 
as a result  we must continue to invest significant resources in product development in order to enhance our solutions and introduce new high quality solutions to meet the wide variety of competitive pressures 
our ability to generate revenue from our business could suffer if we fail to do so successfully 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside north america and  as a result  we face diverse risks related to engaging in international business 
we have offices in six foreign countries and we are dedicating a significant portion of our sales efforts in countries outside north america 
we are dependent on international sales for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue was derived from operations outside the u 
s and we expect that international sales will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
this future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our type and technologies  including the licensing of our solutions worldwide 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent that the united states does  which increases the risk of unauthorized and uncompensated use of our type or technologies  united states and foreign government trade restrictions  including those that may impose restrictions on importation of programming  technology or components to or from the united states  foreign government taxes  regulations and permit requirements  including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the united states  and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the united states  risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  in particular fluctuations in the exchange rate of the japanese yen  the european union s euro  and the united kingdom s pound sterling  including risks related to hedging activities we may undertake  foreign labor laws  regulations and restrictions  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  natural disasters  war and or events of terrorism  and the strength of international economies 

table of contents if we have difficulty finding appropriate partnership and or acquisition candidates  our ability to execute aspects of our strategic plan may be hindered 
we intend to selectively pursue complementary acquisitions  strategic partnerships  including relationships with creative agencies  and third party intellectual property licenses to accelerate our time to market  penetrate new geographies and expand our offering 
execution of our strategy relies on finding and closing partnerships and or acquisitions that fit with our business and that meet our financial expectations 
to the extent that we are unable to identify appropriate opportunities and close deals on acceptable financial terms  we may face hurdles in executing portions of our strategy 
in addition  the pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying  investigating and pursuing suitable acquisitions  whether or not they are consummated 
if we do find appropriate acquisition candidates  the acquisition process may divert our management s attention or result in additional dilution to stockholders or use of resources that are necessary to operate other parts of our business 
as part of our business strategy  we may seek to acquire businesses  products or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our products  enhance our technical capabilities or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with such acquisitions  incurrence of acquisition related costs  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business  and use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate such acquisitions 
in addition  we could discover deficiencies withheld from us in an acquisition or otherwise not uncovered in our due diligence prior to the acquisition 
these deficiencies could include problems in internal controls  product quality  customer relationships or compliance with applicable laws  any of which could result in us becoming subject to unforeseen liabilities 
moreover  a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets  which must be assessed for impairment at least annually 
in the future  if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns  we may be required to take charges to our earnings based on this impairment assessment process  which could harm our results of operations 
acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or in the incurrence of debt  which could adversely affect our operating results 
in addition  if an acquired business fails to meet our expectations  our operating results may suffer 
we rely on the manufacturers to whom we license our type and technologies to accurately prepare royalty reports for our determination of licensing revenue and if these reports are inaccurate  our revenue may be under  or over stated and our forecasts and budgets may be incorrect 
our license revenue is generated primarily from royalties and recurring revenues paid by customers who license our type and technologies 
under these arrangements  our customers typically pay us a fee based on usage of our solutions and we rely on our licensees to accurately report their usage 
we calculate our license fees  prepare our financial reports  projections and budgets and direct our licensing and technology development efforts based in part on these reports 
however  it is often difficult for us to independently determine whether or not our licensees are reporting accurately 
we have implemented an audit program of our licensees records  but the effects of this program may be limited as audits are 
table of contents generally expensive and time consuming  and initiating audits could harm our relationships with licensees 
in addition  our audit rights are contractually limited 
to the extent that our licensees understate or fail to report their usage of their solutions  we will not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled 
alternatively  we may encounter circumstances in which a customer may notify us that it previously reported inaccurate usage 
in such cases  we may be required to give our licensee a credit which would result in a reduction in revenue in the period in which a credit is granted  and such a reduction could be material 
parties from whom we license fonts or components of our technology may challenge the basis for our calculations of the royalties due to them 
some of our agreements with licensors require us to give them the right to audit our calculations of royalties payable to them 
in addition  licensors may at any time challenge the basis of our calculations and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in our defense 
any royalties paid as a result of any successful challenge would increase our expenses and could negatively impact our relationship with such licensor  including by impairing our ability to continue to use and re license technologies or fonts from that licensor 
we incur significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with changing laws and regulations  including those affecting public companies  which could affect our operating results 
we have incurred and will incur significant costs  and have and could experience internal resources constraints  associated with the evaluation of and compliance with evolving corporate governance  reporting and other requirements  including requirements under the sarbanes oxley act and the massachusetts data protection laws  as well as rules implemented by the sec  and the nasdaq global select market 
the expenses incurred by public companies for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing 
we expect that the rules and regulations applicable to us could cause our legal and financial compliance costs to increase and could make some activities more time consuming and costly 
in addition  in the current public company environment  officers and directors are subject to increased scrutiny and may be subject to increased potential liability 
as a result  it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers 
this could negatively impact our future success 
our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly 
we expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations 
the revenue we generate and our operating results will be affected by numerous factors  including general economic conditions  demand for ce devices that include our solutions  demand for our fonts and custom font design services  delays in product shipment by our customers  industry consolidation  introduction  enhancement and market acceptance of type and technology offered by us and our competitors  price reductions by us or our competitors or changes in how type and related technologies are priced  the mix of solutions offered by us and our competitors  the mix of international and us revenue generated by licensing our solutions  
table of contents financial implications of acquisitions  in particular foreign acquisitions involving different accounting standards  foreign currency issues  international tax planning requirements and the like  timing of billings to customers on royalty reports received by us under our licensing agreements  and our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel 
a substantial portion of our quarterly revenue is based on actual shipments by our customers of products incorporating our solutions in the preceding quarter  and not on contractually agreed upon minimum revenue commitments 
because the shipping of products by our customers is outside our control and difficult to predict  our ability to accurately forecast quarterly revenue is limited 
our revenue also varies from quarter to quarter as a result of variances on the timing of transactions through our e commerce websites 
quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may  in turn  cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
we believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
the loss of key members of our senior management team may prevent us from executing our business strategy 
our future success depends in large part upon the continued services of key members of our senior management team 
all of our executive officers and key employees are at will employees 
douglas j 
shaw  chief executive officer  has been with the company and its predecessor in various senior management roles for years 
mr 
shaw has been critical to the overall management of the company  as well as the development of our solutions  our culture and our strategic direction 
the loss of his services or of the services of other key members of our senior management could seriously harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
we also may have to incur significant costs in identifying  hiring  training and retaining replacements for key employees 
we rely on highly skilled personnel  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to maintain our operations or grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals  including font designers who are recognized as leaders in the industry and experienced software engineers 
these individuals have acquired specialized knowledge and skills with respect to us and our operations 
these individuals can be terminated or can leave our employ at any time 
some of these individuals are consultants 
if any of these individuals or a group of individuals were to terminate their employment unexpectedly or end their consulting relationship sooner than anticipated  we could face substantial difficulty in hiring qualified successors  could incur significant costs in connection with their termination and could experience a loss in productivity while any such successor obtains the necessary training and experience 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate and retain highly skilled personnel and consultants for all areas of our organization 
in this regard  if we are unable to hire and train a sufficient number of qualified employees and consultants for any reason or retain employees or consultants with the required expertise  we may not be able to implement our current initiatives or grow effectively or execute our business strategy successfully 

table of contents risks related to the securities markets and investment in our common stock the structure of our current credit facility could affect our financing options and liquidity 
we have a five year  million secured revolving credit facility with wells fargo capital finance llc the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon  at the company s option  either london interbank offering rate  libor or the base rate  plus in each case  an applicable margin 
the credit facility contains certain financial covenants and is secured by substantially all of our assets 
in the event that we draw down on the credit facility more fully  it could have important consequences to our business or the holders of our common stock  including limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures or acquisitions  requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of the principal of and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for other purposes  and making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and limiting our ability to withstand competitive pressures 
market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  most of which we cannot control  including announcements of new products  services or technologies  commercial relationships  acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies  variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in our financial guidance or securities analysts estimates of our financial performance  changes in accounting principles  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders  additions or departures of key personnel  discussion of us or our stock price by the financial press and in online investor communities  general market or economic conditions  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors  and other risks and uncertainties described in these risk factors 
market prices of technology companies have been extremely volatile 
stock prices of many technology companies have often fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
in the past  following periods of market volatility  stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation 
if we were involved in securities litigation  it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of management from our business 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult and may inhibit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us or a change in our management 
these provisions include a classified board of directors  a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders and the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 
although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain greater value for stockholders by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  they would apply even if an offer rejected by our board were considered beneficial by some stockholders 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors  which is responsible for appointing the members of our management 
we currently pay dividends on our common stock  but there is no guarantee that this will continue 
beginning in the third quarter of  our board of directors approved a dividend to shareholders of our common stock 
we expect this to be a recurring quarterly dividend with future payments and record dates being subject to board approval  however if our financial or operating conditions change  or if we fail to satisfy the restrictive covenants contained in the terms of our credit facility that limit our ability to make dividend payments  it may affect our ability to pay this dividend on a quarterly basis or at all 
we may require additional capital  and raising additional funds by issuing securities or additional debt financing may cause dilution to existing stockholders  restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
we may raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our existing stockholders ownership will be diluted 
any new debt financing we enter into may involve covenants that restrict our operations more than our current credit facility 
these restrictive covenants would likely include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets and our ability to pay dividends  as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments

twelve employees from bitstream s us operations and engineers and type designers from bitstream s india operations have joined the company in connection with the acquisition  which provides us with an expanded global presence 
we believe the acquisition has strengthened our products and services  while providing customers with improved choice and flexibility

of the purchase price  approximately million was paid in cash and million  or  shares  in common stock were issued

 business combinations  or asc the majority of the common stock issued in connection with the acquisition was issued to shareholders of ascender  who immediately upon closing became employees of the company 
the stock awards granted are subject to vesting terms that require employment to continue over our standard four year term 
as a result  approximately million of the million in common stock issued is being expensed as share based compensation over the four year vesting term 
at the acquisition date  the company had a pre existing relationship with ascender  an exclusive licensing agreement with a fair value equivalent to its book value of million that was effectively settled on acquisition 
in accordance with asc  the settlement of the license was included as part of total consideration and has been allocated among the assets acquired 
sources of revenue we derive revenue from two principal sources licensing our fonts and font related services to creative and business professionals  which we refer to as our creative professional revenue  and licensing our text imaging solutions to ce device manufacturers and independent software vendors  which we refer to as our oem revenue 
we derive our creative professional revenue primarily from multinational corporations  graphic designers  media organizations  advertisers  printers and publishers 
we derive our oem revenue primarily from ce device manufacturers 
some of our revenue streams  particularly custom revenue where spending is largely discretionary in nature  have historically been and we expect them to continue to be in the future  susceptible to weakening economic conditions 
our customers are located in the united states  asia  europe  and throughout the rest of the world  and our operating subsidiaries are located in the united states  japan  the united kingdom  germany  india and hong kong 
we are dependent on international sales by our foreign operating subsidiaries for a substantial amount of our total revenue 
revenue from our asian subsidiaries is generally from asian customers and revenue from our other subsidiaries is from customers in a number of different countries  including the united states 
we attribute revenue to geographic areas based on the location of our subsidiary receiving such revenue 
for example  licenses may be sold to a large international company headquartered in korea  but the sale is received and recorded by our subsidiary located in the united states 
in this example  the revenue would be reflected in the united states totals in the table below 
sales of total sales of total sales of total in thousands of dollars  except united states asia united kingdom germany total 
table of contents for the years ended december   and  sales by our subsidiaries located outside north america comprised  and  respectively  of our total revenue 
united states revenue  in the table above for  increased in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue  as compared to  primarily the result of our acquisition of bitstream and growth in markets principally served by our us subsidiaries 
in  revenue from the united states increased both in dollars and as a percent of revenue  as compared to  as a result of several factors  including  contractual changes with an existing customer  growth in markets primarily served by our us subsidiary and our acquisition of ascender 
we expect that sales by our international subsidiaries will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
future international revenue will depend on the continued use and expansion of our text imaging solutions worldwide 
we derive a majority of our revenue from a limited number of customers  in particular manufacturers of laser printers and mobile phones 
for the years ended december   and  our top ten licensees by revenue accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue  respectively 
no one customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in  or cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists of font license fees that we pay on certain fonts that are owned by third parties  allocated internal engineering expense and overhead costs directly related to custom design services 
license fees that we pay to third parties are typically based on a percentage of our creative professional and oem revenue and do not involve minimum fees 
our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue and  as a result  our gross margin varies from period to period depending on the level of custom design revenue recorded 
cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquired technology  which we amortize over to years 
for purposes of amortizing acquired technology we estimate the remaining useful life of the technology based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the technology and the way our customers use it 
we use the straight line method to amortize our acquired technology 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
gross profit our gross profit percentage is influenced by a number of factors including product mix  pricing and volume at any particular time 
however  our cost of oem revenue is typically lower than our cost of creative professional revenue because we own a higher percentage of the fonts licensed to our oem customers  provide value added technology and have negotiated lower royalty rates on the fonts we license from third parties because of volume 
within our creative professional business  the cost of our custom design service revenue is substantially higher than the cost of our other revenue 
as a result  our gross profit varies from period to period depending on the mix between  and within  creative professional and oem revenue 
marketing and selling our marketing and selling expense consists of salaries  bonuses  commissions and benefits related to our marketing and selling personnel  business travel expenses  advertising and trade show expenses  web related expenses  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
sales commission expense varies as a function of revenue and goal achievement from period to period 

table of contents research and development our research and development expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our research and development  engineering  font design and integration support personnel and their business travel expenses  license fees related to certain of our technology licenses  expenses for contracted services and allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses 
our research and development expense in a given period may be reduced to the extent that internal engineering resources are allocated to cost of revenue for custom design services 
our research and development is primarily focused on enhancing the functionality of our text imaging solutions and developing new products 
from time to time we license third party font technology in connection with new technology development projects that are part of our research and development efforts 
our research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
general and administrative our general and administrative expense consists of salaries  bonuses and benefits related to our general and administrative personnel  accounting  legal and other professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other overhead expenses and insurance costs 
amortization of intangible assets we amortize intangible assets acquired as follows customer relationships to years  acquired technology to years  and non compete agreements to years 
for purposes of amortization  we estimate the life of customer relationships based upon various considerations  including our knowledge of the industry and the marketplace in which we operate 
we amortize non compete agreements over the stated life of the agreement 
we use the straight line method to amortize our intangible assets 
there is no reliable evidence to suggest that we should expect any other pattern of amortization than an even pattern  and we believe this best reflects the expected pattern of economic usage 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our critical accounting policies may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements in item revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with asc topic no 
 software revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 

table of contents creative professional revenue our creative professional revenue is derived from font licenses  font related services and from custom font design services 
we license fonts directly to end users through our e commerce websites  via telephone  email and indirectly through third party resellers 
font related services refer to our web font services and the web design tools from our latest acquisition  design by front 
we also license fonts and provide custom font design services to graphic designers  advertising agencies  media organizations and corporations 
we refer to direct  indirect and custom revenue  as non web revenue  and refer to revenue that is derived from our websites  as web revenue 
revenue from font licenses to our e commerce customers is recognized upon payment by the customer and electronic shipment of the software embodying the font 
revenue from font licenses to other customers is recognized upon shipment of the software embodying the font and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue from resellers is recognized upon notification from the reseller that our font product has been licensed and when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
custom font design services are generally recognized upon delivery 
font related service revenue is mainly subscription based and  from time to time  it may contain software as a service 
the subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period 
web server and commercial rights to online fonts is recurring revenue and is recognized upon payment by the customer and proof of font delivery 
contract accounting is used where services are deemed essential to the software 
oem revenue our oem revenue is derived substantially from per unit royalties received for printer imaging and printer driver  or printer products  and display imaging products 
under our licensing arrangements we typically receive a royalty for each product unit incorporating our text imaging solutions that is shipped by our oem customers 
we also receive oem revenue from fixed fee licenses with certain of our oem customers 
fixed fee licensing arrangements are not based on units the customer ships  but instead  customers pay us on a periodic basis for use of our typefaces and technology 
although significantly less than royalties from per unit shipments and fixed fees from oem customers  we also receive revenue from software application and operating systems vendors  who include our typefaces and technology in their products  and for font development 
many of our per unit royalty licenses continue for the duration that our oem customers ship products that include our technology  unless terminated for breach 
other licenses have terms that typically range from three to five years  and usually provide for automatic or optional renewals 
we recognize revenue from per unit royalties in the period during which we receive a royalty report from a customer  typically one quarter after royalty bearing units are shipped  as we do not have the ability to estimate the number of units shipped by our customers 
revenue from fixed fee licenses is generally recognized when it is billed to the customer  so long as the product has been delivered  the license fee is fixed and non refundable and collection is probable 
goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and long lived assets we record tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination under the purchase method of accounting 
amounts paid for acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the date of acquisition 
we allocate the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination to goodwill 
the value initially assigned to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  particularly intangible assets and goodwill  are subject to underlying assumptions that require significant management judgment 
if different assumptions were used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we perform our annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairment tests as of 
table of contents december 
in september  the fasb issued accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic no 
testing goodwill for impairment 
this asu provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing on goodwill is necessary 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  no further testing is required 
in july  the fasb issued asu  no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic no 
testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which amended its guidance on the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment to simplify and improve consistency of impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
this asu provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment for determining whether an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  similar to the goodwill impairment testing options permitted from september standard update 
specifically  an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step test 
if an entity believes  as a result of its qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the quantitative impairment test is required 
otherwise  the quantitative test is optional 
for both years presented  and  we assessed qualitative factors of goodwill  as described below  to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit was impaired and determined that the fair value was more likely than not higher than its carrying value 
in  we assessed qualitative factors of our indefinite lived intangible assets and in we performed the quantitative two step fair value impairment test on our indefinite lived intangibles 
we applied the relief from royalty method  a variation of the discounted cash flow method  to determine the fair value of these assets under the two step test 
in both years presented  we determined that the fair value was more likely than not higher that the carrying value 
with respect to both goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  a sustained decrease in share price or current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of useful lives and future cash flows  including assumptions about future conditions such as future revenue  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
if this resulted in an impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with asc topic no 
 compensation stock compensation or asc  which requires the measurement of compensation costs at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we valued awards granted based on the grant date closing price of our common stock as traded on the nasdaq global select market 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to determine the weighted average fair value of options granted and recognizes the compensation cost of share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards using the black scholes model are affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate volatility by using a blend of our stock price history  for the length of time we have market data for our stock and the historical volatility of similar public companies for the remainder of the expected term of each grant 
this is estimated in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab the expected life of the awards is estimated based on the simplified method  as defined in sab the risk free interest rate assumption is based on a us treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the expected life of our awards 
the expected dividend yield 
table of contents assumption for is based on our history of no expectation of paying dividends together with the actual yield of one quarterly dividend that was paid during the fourth quarter 
prior to  the expected dividend yield assumption was based on our history up to that point  and the expectation of paying no dividends 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis and if factors change and we employ different assumptions  share based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned share based compensation expense 
future share based compensation expense and unearned share based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
during the years ended december   and  we recorded total share based compensation expense of million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   the company had million of unrecognized compensation expense related to employees and directors unvested stock options and restricted share awards that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with asc subtopic no 
 defined benefit plans pension 
our unfunded defined benefit pension plan was acquired in connection with our acquisition of linotype on august  the pension plan was closed to new participants in the pension plan covers substantially all employees of our linotype subsidiary who joined linotype prior to the plan closing 
benefits under this plan are based on the employees years of service and compensation 
we fund the plan sufficiently to meet current benefits only 
there are no assets associated with the plan 
in and we paid thousand and thousand  respectively  to the plan participants 
at december  and  our unfunded position was million and million  respectively 
a significant portion of the pension benefit obligation is determined based on the rate of future compensation increases  inflation and interest rates 
given the fact that the pension plan is unfunded  changes in economic and market conditions may require us to increase cash contributions in future years 
in addition  changes to our assumptions may materially impact the accrued pension liability 
provision for income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
 income taxes  or asc under this method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  as measured by enacted tax rates in effect when these differences are expected to be reversed 
this process includes estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery to be unlikely  we have established a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our financial position and results of operations may be materially affected if actual results significantly differ from these estimates or the estimates are adjusted in future periods 

table of contents we have recorded a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  including foreign tax credits  where we have determined that their future use is uncertain 
asc requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence is considered  including a company s performance  the market environment in which the company operates  length of carry back and carry forward periods  existing sales backlog  future taxable income projections and tax planning strategies 
we have historically provided valuation allowances on certain tax assets  due to the uncertainty of generating taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction and of the appropriate character to realize such assets 
in these instances  the company has made the determination that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax will not be realized 
we will continue to review our deferred tax position on a periodic basis and will reflect any change in judgment as a discrete item in the related period 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period that the assessments are made or resolved  or when the statute of limitations for certain periods expires 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing the future impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the tax effect of these temporary differences is shown on our december  consolidated balance sheet see note to our consolidated financial statements and denotes these differences as a net deferred tax liability of million 
this consists of total deferred tax liabilities of million and net deferred tax assets of million after providing a valuation allowance of million 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities measured at fair value 
all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized as current period income or expense unless specific hedge criteria are met  which requires that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting at the inception of each instrument 
we recorded our derivatives at fair value  which is determined based on the provisions of asc topic no 
 fair value measurements and disclosures  using either quoted market prices or prices for similar instruments 
the determination of fair value of our derivatives considers our non performance risk and that of our counterparties

recently issued accounting pronouncements indefinite lived intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic no 
testing for indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which amended its guidance on the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment to simplify and improve consistency of impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
after an assessment of certain qualitative factors  if it is determined to be more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired entities must perform the quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  the quantitative test is optional 
the statement is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we perform our annual testing in the fourth quarter 
the company has elected early adoption and has applied this guidance for its year ended december  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued asc topic no 
 comprehensive income  which amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income in financial statements to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items that are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the new accounting guidance requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a single statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement  or a separate statement of comprehensive income immediately following the income statement 
companies will no longer be allowed to present comprehensive income on the statement of changes in shareholders equity 
in both options  companies must present the components of net income  total net income  the components of other comprehensive income  total other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income

significant variations in operating cash flows frequently occur because  from time to time  our customers make prepayments against future royalties

the credit facility replaced the amended and restated credit agreement  which was scheduled to expire on july  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on the leverage ratio at either i the prime rate plus  as defined in the credit agreement  or ii libor plus 
the company is required to pay an unused line fee equal to per annum on the undrawn portion available under the revolving credit facility and variable per annum fees in respect of outstanding letters of credit 
as of december   the blended interest rate on the credit facility was 
there are no required repayments 
the company  in accordance with the credit facility  is permitted to request that the lenders  at their election  increase the secured credit facility to a maximum of million 
in addition  the credit facility provides that we maintain a maximum leverage ratio 
the leverage ratio is defined as the ratio of aggregate outstanding indebtedness to trailing twelve months adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as consolidated net earnings or loss  plus net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense  plus restructuring  issuance costs  cash non operating costs and other expenses or losses minus cash non operating gains and other non cash gains  provided however that the aggregate of all cash non operating expense shall not exceed thousand and all such fees  costs and expenses shall not exceed million on a trailing twelve months basis 
additional limits are imposed on acquisition related expenses 
we also must maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio 
as of december   the maximum leverage ratio permitted was and our leverage ratio was and the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio was and our fixed charge ratio was 
failure to comply with these covenants  or the occurrence of an event of default  could permit the lenders under the credit facility to declare all amounts borrowed under the credit facility  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and places limits on the company s and its subsidiaries ability to incur debt or liens and engage in sale leaseback transactions  make loans and investments  incur additional indebtedness  engage in mergers  acquisitions and asset sales  transact with affiliates and alter its business 
in connection with the refinancing  the company incurred closing fees of million plus legal fees of approximately million 
in accordance with asc subtopic no 
 modifications and extinguishments of debt  these fees were accounted for as deferred financing costs and will be amortized to interest expense over the term of the credit facility 
in addition  approximately million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the pro rata share of prior loan syndicate lenders that did not participate in the credit facility was written off as a debt extinguishment and charged to other expense in

adjusted ebitda as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of depreciation and amortization expense  interest expense  net  the provision benefit for income taxes and share based compensation and therefore does not represent an accurate measure of profitability  particularly in situations where a company is highly leveraged or has a disadvantageous tax structure 
we have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we have a significant amount of debt  and interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
we generally incur significant us federal  state and foreign income taxes each year and the provision benefit for income taxes is a necessary element of our costs and therefore its exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
share based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
non cash expenses  restructuring  issuance and cash non operating expenses have a meaningful impact on our financial statements 
therefore  their exclusion from adjusted ebitda is a material limitation 
as a result  adjusted ebitda should be evaluated in conjunction with net income loss for complete analysis of our profitability  as net income loss includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to adjusted ebitda

we believe that net adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our gaap results  while isolating the effects of charges that may vary from period to period without direct correlation to underlying operating performance 
we believe that these non gaap financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision making

non gaap earnings per diluted share as an operating performance measure has material limitations since it excludes the statement of income impact of amortization expense and share based compensation  and therefore  does not represent an accurate measure of profitability 
we have significant intangible assets and amortization expense is a meaningful element in our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from non gaap earnings per diluted share is a material limitation 
share based compensation and the associated expense has a meaningful impact on our financial statements and therefore its exclusion from non gaap diluted earnings per share is a material limitation 
as a result  non gaap earnings per diluted share should be evaluated in conjunction with earnings per diluted share for complete analysis of our profitability  as earnings per diluted share includes the financial statement impact of these items and is the most directly comparable gaap operating performance measure to non gaap earnings per diluted share 
as non gaap earnings per diluted share is not defined by gaap  our definition of non gaap earnings per diluted share may differ from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of the limitations that non gaap earnings per share has as an analytical tool  investors should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our operating results as reported under gaap

table of contents see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report under item see note to the audited consolidated financial statements regarding contractual obligations included in this report under item we may be required to make cash outlays related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
for further information on unrecognized tax benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item in addition to the above  we have a pension obligation under the linotype defined benefit pension plan

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk  including interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange risk 
concentration of revenue and credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables

interest rate risk we use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate volatility resulting from our variable rate debt  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report under item asc topic no 
 derivatives and hedging  or asc  requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships  including a requirement that all designations must be made at the inception of each instrument 
as we did not make such initial designations  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are to be recognized as current period income or expense 
the fair value of derivative instruments is estimated based on the amount that we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt 
the interest rate on our amended and restated credit agreement fluctuates with either the prime rate or the libor interest rate 
at december   the blended rate of interest on our outstanding debt was 
for each one percent increase in interest rates our interest expense would increase by million 
historically  we have purchased interest rate swap instruments to hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our debt obligations 
on may   we entered into a long term interest rate swap contract to pay a fixed rate of interest of in exchange for a floating rate interest payment tied to the one month libor beginning january the contract matured on july  the total fair value of the financial instrument at december  was a liability of approximately million 
in  and  we recognized losses of thousand  million and million  respectively  on our interest rate swap contracts which have been included in loss gain on derivatives in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk in accordance with asc topic no 
 foreign currency matters  or asc  all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is a currency other than us dollars are translated into us dollars at an exchange rate as of the balance sheet date 
revenue and expenses of these subsidiaries are translated at the average monthly exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustments as calculated from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries to us dollars are recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income 
we also incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses related to certain customers that are invoiced in us dollars  but who have the option to make an equivalent payment in their own functional currencies at a specified exchange rate as of a specified date 
in the period from that date until payment in the customer s functional currency is received and converted into us dollars  we can incur realized gains and losses 
to mitigate our exposure we utilize forward contracts with maturities of days or less to hedge our exposure to these currency fluctuations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of the forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged assets of our consolidated foreign affiliate 
at december  and there were no currency contracts outstanding 
in addition  we incur foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses on an intercompany note with one of our foreign subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
at december  the note was paid in full 
historically  we maintained a currency swap to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the intercompany note 
on may   we entered into a long term currency swap contract to purchase million euros in exchange for million to mitigate our exposure to
