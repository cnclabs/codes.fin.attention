our major expenses are employee compensation  distribution related expenses  facilities expense and information technology expense 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  investments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
business developments prevailing market conditions affect our managed asset levels  operating results and the recoverability of our investments

the acquisition contributed to a lowering of our overall average effective fee rate to basis points in fiscal from basis points in fiscal our average effective investment advisory and administrative fee rate similarly decreased to basis points in fiscal from basis points in fiscal the primary driver of our overall average effective fee rate continues to be the mix of assets by distribution channel and mandate

in fiscal  the adjustments made to the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests in parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital were million  million and million  respectively 
net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests is not adjusted for taxes due to the underlying tax status of our consolidated subsidiaries 
parametric  parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital are limited liability companies that are treated as partnerships for tax purposes 
funds and the clo entities we consolidate are registered investment companies or private funds that are treated as pass through entities for tax purposes 
changes in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the assets and liabilities of consolidated clo entities do not affect our liquidity or capital resources 
the collateral assets of consolidated clo entities are held solely to satisfy the obligations of the entities  and we have no right to these assets beyond our direct investment in and management fees generated from the entities  both of which are eliminated in consolidation 
the note holders of the clo entities have no recourse to the general credit of the company 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of consolidated clo entities are excluded from the discussion of liquidity and capital resources below 
the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources on october   and and uses of cash for the years then ended balance sheet and cash flow data october  in thousands balance sheet data assets cash and cash equivalents    investment advisory fees and other receivables  total liquid assets    investments    liabilities debt    years ended october  in thousands cash flow data operating cash flows    investing cash flows    financing cash flows    liquidity and capital resources liquid assets consist of cash and cash equivalents and investment advisory fees and other receivables 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short term  highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash 
investment advisory fees and other receivables primarily represent receivables due from sponsored funds and separately managed accounts for investment advisory and distribution services provided 
liquid assets represented percent and percent of total assets on october  and  respectively  excluding those assets identified as assets of consolidated clo entities 
the company s seed investments in consolidated funds and separate accounts are not treated as liquid assets because they may be longer term in nature

the million net cash used for the purchase of available for sale securities and investments in equity method investees primarily reflects our acquisition of a percent interest in hexavest 
the increase in investment advisory fees and other receivables can be attributed to the increase in our revenue run rate at the end of fiscal compared to the end of fiscal on june   we issued million in senior notes 
the proceeds of the issuance were used primarily to purchase million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
the company paid million to retire the senior notes  which included an early tender premium and accrued and unpaid interest 
executing these transactions enabled us to stagger the maturity of our debt  with million now due in and million due in on october   our debt consisted of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes and million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
we also maintain a million unsecured revolving credit facility with several banks that expires on june  the facility provides that we may borrow at libor based rates of interest that vary depending on the level of usage of the facility and our credit ratings 
the agreement contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage and requires us to pay an annual commitment fee on any unused portion 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility at october  or at any point during the fiscal year 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of october  we continue to monitor our liquidity daily 
we remain committed to growing our business and expect that our main uses of cash will be seed investments in new products  acquire shares of our non voting common stock  pay dividends  make strategic acquisitions  enhance technology infrastructure and pay the operating expenses of the business  which are largely variable in nature and fluctuate with revenue and assets under management 
we believe that our existing liquid assets  cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility are sufficient to meet our current and forecasted operating cash needs for the next twelve months and to satisfy our future commitments as more fully described in contractual obligations below 
the risk exists  however  that if we need to raise additional capital or refinance existing debt in the future  resources may not be available to us in sufficient amounts or on acceptable terms 
our ability to enter the capital markets in a timely manner depends on a number of factors  including the state of global credit and equity markets  interest rates  credit spreads and our credit ratings 
if we are unable to access capital markets to issue new debt  refinance existing debt or sell shares of our non voting common stock as needed  or if we are unable to obtain such financing on acceptable terms  our business could be adversely impacted 
we have a well known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec that registers an unspecified amount of non voting common stock  debt securities  depositary shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units for future issuance 
on june   we used this shelf registration statement to complete the underwritten public offering of the senior notes 
we would expect to use the net proceeds of future securities sales under the shelf registration for general corporate purposes 
recoverability of our investments our million of investments as of october  consisted of our percent equity interest in hexavest  positions in company managed funds and separate accounts entered into for investment and business development purposes  and certain other investments held directly by the company 
investments in company managed funds and separate accounts and direct investments by the company are generally in liquid debt or equity securities and are carried at fair market value 
we test our investments  other than equity method investments  for impairment on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our investments in non consolidated clo entities and investments classified as available for sale for impairment using quantitative factors  including how long the investment has been in a net unrealized loss position  and qualitative factors  including the credit quality of the underlying issuer and our ability and intent to continue holding the investment 
if markets deteriorate in the quarters ahead  our assessment of impairment on a quantitative basis may lead us to impair investments in future quarters that were in an unrealized loss position at october  we test our investments in equity method investees  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or as facts and circumstances indicate that additional analysis is warranted 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  we periodically review our deferred sales commissions and identifiable intangible assets for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
there have been no significant changes in financial condition in fiscal that would indicate that an impairment loss exists at october  operating cash flows our operating cash flows are calculated by adjusting net income to reflect other significant sources and uses of cash  certain significant non cash items and timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities 
significant sources and uses of cash that are not reflected in either revenue or operating expenses include net cash flows associated with our deferred sales commission assets capitalized sales commissions paid net of contingent deferred sales charges received as well as net cash flows associated with the purchase and sale of investments within the portfolios of our consolidated funds and separate accounts proceeds received from the sale of trading investments net of cash outflows associated with the purchase of trading investments 
significant non cash items include the amortization of deferred sales commissions and intangible assets  depreciation  stock based compensation and net change in deferred income taxes 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects an increase in the net purchase of trading securities and net losses on seed capital investments in fiscal compared to net gains in fiscal  partially offset by adjustments to reflect classification of the loss on extinguishment of debt as a financing activity and consolidated clo entity net losses compared to net gains in fiscal cash used for operating activities in the fiscal year ended october  reflects the impact of a million payment made to resolve matters relating to a state tax audit 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal  an increase of million from million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects a net increase in operating cash flows related to timing differences in the cash settlement of other assets and liabilities  partially offset by consolidated clo entity net gains compared to net losses in fiscal and an increase in our net deferred income tax asset 
investing cash flows cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements  cash paid in acquisitions and the purchase and sale of available for sale investments in sponsored funds that we do not consolidate 
cash provided by investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash used for investing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash provided by investing activities can be primarily attributed to an increase of million in net proceeds from the sale of available for sale securities and a million increase in the net proceeds from the sale and maturities of consolidated clo entity investments  offset by the million net cash paid in the clifton acquisition 
in fiscal and  the company made contingent payments of million and million  respectively  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
cash used for investing activities totaled million in fiscal compared to cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by investing activities can be primarily attributed to our acquisition of a percent equity interest in hexavest  which is included in purchase of investments 
in fiscal and  the company made contingent payments of million and million  respectively  to the sellers of tabs under the terms of the acquisition agreement 
financing cash flows financing cash flows primarily reflect distributions to non controlling interest holders of our majority owned subsidiaries and consolidated funds  the purchase of additional non controlling interests in our majority owned subsidiaries  the issuance and repurchase of our non voting common stock  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises  the payment of dividends to our shareholders and the proceeds and payments associated with the company s debt

as of october   we have authorization to purchase an additional million shares under our current share repurchase authorization and anticipate that future repurchases will continue to be an ongoing use of cash 
our dividends declared per share were in fiscal  including a one time special dividend of per share declared and paid in december  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal we currently expect to declare and pay quarterly dividends on our voting and non voting common stock comparable to the dividend declared in the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in conjunction with the offering we paid approximately million in debt offering costs that will be amortized over the life of the notes and recognized as a component of interest expense 
in june  we retired million principal amount of our outstanding percent senior notes due  paying a tender premium of million

this amount includes unrecognized tax benefits along with accrued interest and penalties 
in july  we committed to invest up to million in a private equity partnership that invests in companies in the financial services industry 
we had invested million of the maximum million as of october  the remaining commitment is included in the table above 
in fiscal  we committed to an approximately million investment in a clo entity that had not closed as of october  the commitment is included in the table above and was satisfied in november interests held by non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital are not subject to mandatory redemption 
the purchase of non controlling interests is predicated  for each of them  on the exercise of a series of puts held by non controlling interest holders and calls held by us 
neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling interest holders remaining employed by the affiliated entity 
the puts provide the non controlling interest holders the right to require us to purchase these retained interests at specified intervals over time  while the calls provide us with the right to require the non controlling interest holders to sell their retained equity interests to us at specified intervals over time  as well as upon the occurrence of certain events such as death or permanent disability 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
the value assigned to the purchase of an originating non controlling interest is based  in each case  on a multiple of earnings before interest and taxes of the subsidiary  which is a measure that is intended to represent fair market value 
there is no discrete floor or ceiling on any non controlling interest purchase 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount of any non controlling interest purchase in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made to purchase non controlling interests have been excluded from the above table  unless a put or call option has been exercised and a mandatory firm commitment exists for us to purchase such non controlling interests 
although the timing and amounts of these purchases cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate that the purchase of non controlling interests in our consolidated subsidiaries may be a significant use of cash in future years 
we have presented all redeemable non controlling interests at redemption value on our consolidated balance sheet as of october  we have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at fair value as a component of additional paid in capital and have recorded the current year change in the estimated redemption value of non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value as a component of net income attributable to non controlling and other beneficial interests 
based on our calculations  the estimated redemption value of our non controlling interests  redeemable at either fair value or other than fair value  totaled million on october  compared to million on october  redeemable non controlling interests as of october  consist of third party investors ownership in consolidated investment funds of million  non controlling interests in parametric risk advisors and atlanta capital redeemable at other than fair value of million and million  respectively  non controlling interests in parametric issued in conjunction with the clifton acquisition and redeemable at fair value of million and profit interests granted under the long term incentive plans of parametric and atlanta capital redeemable at fair value of million and million  respectively

related to its acquisition of the tabs business in december  the company is obligated to make three additional annual contingent payments based on prescribed multiples of tabs s revenue for the twelve months ending december   and there is no defined floor or ceiling on such payments  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table 
the company made a contingent payment of million with respect to the twelve months ended december  in fiscal in december  certain non controlling interest holders of parametric exercised their final put option pursuant to the terms of the original acquisition agreement requiring the company to purchase an additional percent capital and percent profit interest in the entity 
the million exercise price of the put option was based on a multiple of estimated earnings before taxes for the calendar year ended december  the payment was treated as an equity transaction and reduced redeemable non controlling interests at closing on december  indirect profit interests granted to parametric s employees under a long term equity incentive plan of that entity increased to percent at october   reflecting a percent profit interest granted on november  under the plan 
indirect capital and profit interests in parametric held by the principals of clifton totaled percent on october   reflecting indirect interests issued in conjunction with the clifton acquisition on december  capital and profit interests in parametric held by the company increased to percent and percent  respectively  on october   reflecting the transactions described above 
the company will be obligated to make an additional payment in respect of the acquired interest in hexavest in fiscal if hexavest exceeds defined annual revenue thresholds in the second twelve month period following the closing 
the company made a contingent payment of million with respect to the first twelve month period ended august  we have the option to acquire an additional percent interest in hexavest in there is no defined floor or ceiling on any payment  resulting in significant uncertainty as to the amount of any payment in the future 
accordingly  future payments to be made have been excluded from the above table until such time as the uncertainty has been resolved 
although the amounts of these payments cannot be predicted with certainty  we anticipate they may be a significant use of cash in future years 
in june  parametric exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors to sell a percent interest in parametric risk advisors for million  payable in cash or securities in parametric portfolio lp pp lp  whose sole asset is ownership units in parametric 
the transaction increased parametric s ownership interest from percent to percent when the transaction closed on november  upon execution of the call  redeemable non controlling interests were reduced and a liability was established within other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
on november   the non controlling interest holders of parametric risk advisors entered into a unit acquisition agreement with parametric to exchange their remaining ownership interests in parametric risk advisors  including the percent interest subject to the june call referenced above  for indirect ownership interests in parametric 
the indirect parametric ownership interests issued in this exchange contain put and call features that are exercisable over a four year period beginning in as a result of this exchange  parametric became the sole owner of parametric risk advisors effective november  in september  the company exercised a call option requiring the non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital to sell a percent profit interest and a percent capital interest in atlanta capital to the company for million 
in addition  the non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital exercised a put option requiring the company to purchase an additional percent profit interest and a percent capital interest in atlanta capital for million

the transactions are anticipated to settle in december and will increase the company s capital ownership interest in atlanta capital from percent to percent  and will increase the company s profit ownership interest from percent to percent 
non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital have the right to sell a percent profit interest and their remaining percent capital interest in atlanta capital to the company at a multiple of earnings before taxes based on the financial results of atlanta capital for the fiscal year ended october  and each year thereafter subject to certain restrictions 
the company has the right to purchase the remaining non controlling interest at a multiple of earnings before taxes based on atlanta capital s financial results for the fiscal year ending october  and each year thereafter through october  neither the exercise of the puts nor the exercise of the calls is contingent upon the non controlling interest holders of atlanta capital remaining employees 
indirect profit interests in atlanta capital held by its employees  including profit interests granted under a long term equity incentive plan  were percent prior to the put and call transactions described above  reflecting the percent profit interest granted on november  under the plan 
capital and profit interests in atlanta capital held by the company increased to percent and percent  respectively  after reflecting the put and call transactions described above 
foreign subsidiaries we consider the undistributed earnings of our canadian subsidiary as of october  to be indefinitely re invested in foreign operations 
accordingly  no us income taxes have been provided thereon 
as of october   the company had approximately million of undistributed earnings in our canadian subsidiary that is not available to fund domestic operations or to distribute to shareholders unless repatriated 
repatriation would require the company to accrue and pay us corporate income taxes 
the company does not have a current plan to repatriate these funds 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not invest in any off balance sheet vehicles that provide financing  liquidity  market or credit risk support or engage in any leasing activities that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our accounting policies that require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
consolidation of variable interest entities accounting guidance provides a framework for determining whether an entity should be considered a variable interest entity vie  and  if so  whether our involvement with the entity results in a variable interest in the entity 
if we determine that we do have a variable interest in the entity  we must then perform an analysis to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the vie  we are required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie into the consolidated financial statements of the company 
a company is the primary beneficiary of a vie if it has a controlling financial interest in the vie 
a company is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a vie if it has both i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and ii the obligation to absorb the losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
our evaluation of whether we qualify as the primary beneficiary of a vie is highly complex 
in our analysis  we must make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows of the vie 
these estimates and assumptions relate primarily to market interest rates  credit default rates  pre payment rates  discount rates  the marketability of certain securities and the probability of certain outcomes 
there is also judgment involved in assessing whether we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the vie that could potentially be significant to the entity 
while we believe that our evaluation is appropriate  future changes in estimates  judgments and assumptions in the case of an evaluation triggered by a reconsideration event as defined in the accounting standards may affect the determination of the primary beneficiary status and the resulting consolidation  or deconsolidation  of the assets  liabilities and results of operations of the vie in our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements accounting standards define fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the fair value hierarchy established in these standards prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following categories based on the nature of the inputs that are significant to the fair value measurements in their entirety 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value measurement hierarchy 
in such cases  an investment s classification within the fair value measurement hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of acquired companies over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the dates of acquisition 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisitions of atlanta capital  parametric and clifton  which share similar economic characteristics  to a single reporting unit 
management believes that the inclusion of these entities in a single reporting unit for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing most accurately reflects the synergies achieved in acquiring these entities  namely centralized distribution of similar products and services to similar clients 
we attribute all goodwill associated with the acquisition of tabs and fox asset management to a second reporting unit 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the reporting units to the carrying amounts  including goodwill 
we establish fair value for the purpose of impairment testing by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach for each reporting unit 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  current period actual results  and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by senior management at the reporting unit level 
budgeted results for future periods are most significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the growth in assets under management  future revenue run rates and future operating margins 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the acquired reporting unit 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and forward multiples of both revenue and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
to evaluate the sensitivity of the goodwill impairment testing to the calculation of fair value  we apply a hypothetical percent and percent decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its calculated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets amortized identifiable intangible assets generally represent the cost of client relationships and management contracts acquired 
in valuing these assets  we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates  and significant judgment is required 
we periodically review identifiable intangibles for impairment as events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their respective fair values  additional impairment tests are performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
non amortizing intangible assets generally represent the cost of mutual fund management contracts acquired 
non amortizing intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year by comparing the fair value of the management contracts acquired to their carrying values 
the company establishes fair value for purposes of impairment testing using the income approach 
if the carrying value of a management contract acquired exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
accounting for income taxes our effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates of the many jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
in the ordinary course of business  many transactions occur for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  and we adjust our income tax provision in the period in which we determine that actual outcomes will likely be different from our estimates 
accounting standards require that the tax effects of a position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
unrecognized tax benefits  as well as the related interest  are adjusted regularly to reflect changing facts and circumstances 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning in assessing our taxes  changes in tax laws may result in a change to our tax position and effective tax rate 
we classify any interest or penalties incurred as a component of income tax expense 
management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities and to make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred tax assets 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment takes into account our forecast of future profitability  the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods  our experience with the tax attributes expiring unused  tax planning alternatives and other tax considerations 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense reflects the fair value of stock based awards measured at grant date  is recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant service period generally five years  and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures 
the fair value of option awards granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes option valuation model incorporates assumptions as to dividend yield  volatility  an appropriate risk free interest rate and the expected life of the option 
many of these assumptions require management s judgment but are not subject to significant variability 
management must also apply judgment in developing an expectation of awards that may be forfeited 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
the fair value of profit interests granted under subsidiary long term equity plans is estimated on the date of grant by averaging fair value established using an income approach and fair value established using a market approach for each subsidiary 
the income approach employs a discounted cash flow model that takes into account assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value  including the discount rate and the terminal growth rate  current period results and budgeted results for future periods that have been vetted by the subsidiary s senior management 
budgeted results for future periods are most significantly impacted by assumptions made as to the growth in assets under management  future revenue run rates and future operating margins 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the same fundamental pricing concepts used to calculate fair value in the acquisition due diligence process and a discount rate that takes into consideration our estimated cost of capital adjusted for the uncertainty inherent in the acquisition 
the market approach employs market multiples for comparable transactions in the financial services industry obtained from industry sources  taking into consideration the nature  scope and size of the subsidiary s operations 
estimates of fair value are established using a multiple of assets under management and current and forward multiples of revenue and ebitda adjusted for size and performance level relative to peer companies 
a weighted average calculation is then performed  giving greater weight to fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda and lesser weight to fair value calculated as a multiple of assets under management 
fair values calculated using one year  two year and trailing twelve month revenue multiples and one year  two year and trailing twelve month ebitda multiples are each weighted percent  while fair value calculated based on a multiple of assets under management is weighted percent 
we believe that fair value calculated based on multiples of revenue and ebitda is a better indicator of fair value in that these fair values provide information as to both scale and profitability 
non controlling interests certain interests in our majority owned subsidiaries are puttable at established multiples of earnings before interest and taxes and  as such  are considered redeemable at other than fair value 
the company s non controlling interests redeemable at other than fair value are recorded in temporary equity at estimated redemption value and changes in estimated redemption value are recorded in earnings 
as a result  net income attributable to eaton vance corp 
shareholders and earnings per basic and diluted share are impacted by changes in the estimated redemption values of such redeemable non controlling interests 
accounting developments presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new guidance requiring an entity to present an unrecognized tax benefit  or a portion of an unrecognized tax benefit  in the financial statements as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for any net operating loss carryforward  similar tax loss or tax credit carryforward unless such tax loss or credit carryforward is not available at the reporting date under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes resulting from the disallowance of a tax position 
in the event that the tax position is disallowed or the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction does not require the entity to use  and the entity does not intend to use  the deferred tax asset for such purpose  the unrecognized tax benefit shall be presented in the financial statements as a liability and shall not be combined with deferred tax assets 
the new guidance will be effective for the company on november  the company does not anticipate that the adoption of the new guidance will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
investment companies in june  the fasb issued a final standard amending the current criteria for an entity to qualify as an investment company  creating new disclosure requirements and amending the measurement criteria for certain interests in other investment companies 
the company is evaluating the impact of this amendment and will adopt the new guidance on november  parent s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreign entity or of an investment in a foreign entity in march  the fasb issued new guidance on reporting a cumulative translation adjustment cta with respect to foreign currency 
the new guidance addresses the accounting for a cta when a parent either sells a part of or all of its investment in a foreign entity or no longer holds a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets that is a nonprofit activity or a business within a foreign entity 
the company will adopt the new guidance on november  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued new guidance on reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
the new guidance does not change the requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements  but requires new footnote disclosures regarding the reclassification of aoci by component into net income 
the company will implement the new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is subject to different types of risk  including market risk 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in equity and bond prices  interest rates  credit events or currency exchange rates 
management is responsible for identifying  assessing and managing market and other risks 
in evaluating market risk  it is important to note that most of our revenue is based on the market value of assets under management 
as noted in risk factors in item a  declines of financial market values negatively impact our revenue and net income 
our primary direct exposure to equity price risk arises from investments in equity securities made by consolidated sponsored funds  investments in equity securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes  our investments in sponsored equity funds that are not consolidated and our investments in equity method investees 
equity price risk as it relates to these investments represents the potential future loss of value that would result from a decline in the fair values of the fund shares or underlying equity securities 
the following is a summary of the effect that a percent increase or decrease in equity prices would have on our investments subject to equity price fluctuation at october  in thousands carrying value carrying value assuming a increase carrying value assuming a decrease investment securities  trading equity securities    investment securities  available for sale sponsored funds    investment in equity method investees sponsored funds    total    currently we have a corporate hedging program in place to hedge currency risk and market price exposures on certain investments in consolidated sponsored funds and separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes 
as part of this program  we enter into futures and forward contracts to hedge certain exposures held within the portfolios of these separately managed accounts and consolidated sponsored funds 
the contracts negotiated are short term in nature 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
at october   the company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts  stock index futures contracts and commodity futures contracts with aggregate notional values of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company estimates that a percent adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately million  million and million  respectively  in the fair value of open currency  equity and commodity derivative contracts held at october  in addition to utilizing forwards and futures contracts  the company has also entered into transactions in which securities not yet purchased have been sold 
in its short sales  the company has sold securities that have been borrowed from third party brokers with the intention of buying back identical assets at a later date to return to the lender  thereby incurring a liability 
as of october   the company had million included in other liabilities on its consolidated balance sheet related to securities sold  not yet purchased 
the company estimates that a percent adverse change in market prices would result in a decrease of approximately million in the value of these securities 
we are required to maintain cash collateral for margin accounts established to support certain derivative positions and securities sold short  not yet purchased 
our initial margin requirements are currently equal to five percent of the initial underlying value of the stock index futures and commodity futures contracts 
additional margin requirements include daily posting of variation margin equal to the daily change in the position value and percent of the underlying value of securities sold  not yet purchased 
we do not have a collateral requirement related to foreign currency forward contracts 
cash collateral supporting margin requirements is classified as restricted cash and is included as a component of other assets on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at october   the company was exposed to interest rate risk and credit spread risk as a result of approximately million in investments in fixed and floating rate income funds sponsored or managed by us  debt securities held by sponsored funds we consolidate  debt securities held in separately managed accounts seeded for new product development purposes and debt securities held directly by us 
management considered a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates and determined that an increase of such magnitude would result in a decrease of approximately million in the carrying amount of the company s debt investments and that a decrease of basis points would increase the carrying amount of such investments by approximately million 
from time to time  we seek to offset our exposure to changing interest rates associated with our debt financing 
in june  we announced a tender offer to purchase for cash up to million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes and ultimately accepted for purchase million of the senior notes tendered notes on june  in conjunction with that transaction  we entered into a reverse treasury lock  which effectively locked in the benchmark interest rate to be used in determining the premium above par to be paid to holders of the tendered notes 
the reference us treasury rate increased during the time the reverse treasury lock was outstanding  resulting in a million loss recognized upon termination in june the loss was included in gains losses and other investment income  net in our consolidated statement of income 
in june  we also issued million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
in anticipation of the offering  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap intended to hedge changes in the benchmark interest rate between the time at which the decision was made to issue the debt and the pricing of the securities 
the benchmark interest rate increased during this time and we received payment to settle the hedge for a gain of million 
at termination  the hedge was determined to be an effective cash flow hedge and the million gain was recorded in other comprehensive loss income  net of tax in our consolidated statement of income 
there can be no assurance that our hedge instruments will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts on any future debt offerings 
direct exposure from credit risk arises from our interest in non consolidated clo entities that are included in investments in our consolidated balance sheets as well as our interests in consolidated clo entities that are eliminated in consolidation 
as an investor in a clo entity  we are entitled to only a residual interest in the clo entity  making these investments highly sensitive to the default and recovery experiences of the underlying instruments held by the clo entity 
our investments are subject to an impairment loss in the event that the cash flows generated by the collateral securities are not sufficient to allow equity holders to recover their investments 
if there is deterioration in the credit quality of collateral and reference securities and a corresponding increase in defaults  clo entity cash flows may be adversely impacted and we may be unable to recover our investment 
our total investments in the non consolidated and consolidated clo entities were valued at million and million  respectively  as of october   representing our total value at risk with respect to such entities as of october  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk through our international operations 
while we operate primarily in the united states and  accordingly  most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars  we do provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states 
revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our consolidated balance sheet relates primarily to an equity method investment and cash and cash equivalents that are denominated in foreign currencies  principally canadian dollars 
this risk will likely increase as our business outside of the united states grows 
we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to manage the foreign currency exchange risk exposure we assume in connection with investments in international operations 
as a result  both positive and negative currency fluctuations against the us dollar may affect our results of operations and accumulated other comprehensive income 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes
