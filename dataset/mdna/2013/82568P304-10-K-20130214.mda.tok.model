in may  we acquired the customer accounts and images of kodak gallery s online photo service through a bankruptcy court supervised auction 
in july  we began the process to 
table of contents transfer the more than five billion kodak gallery customer photos onto the shutterfly technology platform  which was completed in september on may   we acquired photoccino ltd  a privately held company based in haifa  israel  which has developed innovative technologies for photo ranking  analysis and organization which will allow customers to more efficiently organize and select the best photos from their ever increasing archives so they can quickly and easily create photo books  calendars  cards  and photo gifts 
photoccino s technology applies proprietary algorithms to analyze and evaluate the quality and content of photos  ranks them  and automatically creates photo products using the customer s best images 
during the fourth quarter of  we began to integrate the photoccino technology by offering smart product creation capabilities to a select set of customers 
we expect to further integrate the photoccino technology into the products and services that our brands offer 
on september   we acquired penguin digital  inc  a mobile application development company that has an iphone application that allows users to access their photos from iphones or their facebook or instagram accounts and create customized products and gifts from their mobile devices 
we subsequently introduced our new shutterfly iphone photo app which combines storage  viewing and photo gift creation right from one phone

com  inc thislife a cloud based service provider for protecting  organizing  storing and sharing photos and videos which will strengthen our photo and video storage and sharing capabilities  as well as the ability to intelligently organize across devices and mobile platforms and enable the more efficient creation of products across the web and on mobile devices 
in  we expect to integrate this technology into the products and services that our shutterfly brand offers 
we generate the majority of our revenues by producing and selling professionally bound photo books  greeting and stationery cards  personalized calendars  other photo based merchandise and high quality prints ranging in size from wallet sized to jumbo sized x enlargements 
we manufacture most of these items in our charlotte  north carolina and phoenix  arizona production facilities 
by controlling the production process in our own production facilities  we are able to produce high quality products  innovate rapidly  maintain a favorable cost structure and ensure timely shipment to customers  even during peak periods of demand 
additionally  we sell a variety of photo based merchandise that is currently manufactured for us by third parties  such as calendars  mugs  canvas prints  mouse pads  magnets  and puzzles 
we generate substantially all of our revenue from sales originating in the united states and our sales cycle has historically been highly seasonal as we generate more than of our total net revenues during our fiscal fourth quarter 
our high quality products and services and the compelling online experience we create for our customers  combined with our focus on continuous innovation  have allowed us to establish premium brands 
we realize the benefits of premium brands through high customer loyalty  low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing 
our customers are a central part of our business model 
they generate most of the content on our service by uploading their photos and storing their memories 
in addition  they share their photos electronically with their friends and families  extending and endorsing our brand and creating a sense of community 
finally  by giving our branded products to colleagues  friends and loved ones throughout the year  customers reinforce our brands 
through these various activities  our customers create a viral network of new users and customers 
in addition to driving lower customer acquisition costs through viral marketing  our customers provide input on new features  functionalities and products 
close  frequent customer interactions  coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs  enable us to fine tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments 
consequently  customers are presented with a highly personalized shopping experience  which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our brands 
our operations and financial performance depend on general economic conditions in the united states 
the us economy is experiencing a slow economic recovery from a deep recession and concerns about that recovery could further impact consumer sentiment and consumer discretionary spending 
we closely monitor these economic measures as their trends are indicators of the health of the overall economy and are some of the key external factors that impact our business 
basis of presentation net revenues 
in the second quarter of  we changed the categories within net revenues by consolidating our personalized products and services pps and prints revenue into a single category called consumer 
we also renamed our commercial printing net revenue category as enterprise 
our net revenues are now comprised of sales generated from consumer and enterprise categories 
all prior periods included below now reflect the new presentation of net revenues categories 

table of contents consumer 
our consumer revenues include sales from all of our brands and are derived from the sale of photo based products  such as photo books  stationery and greeting cards  other photo based merchandise  photo prints  and the related shipping revenues 
included in our photo based merchandise are items such as mugs  iphone cases  mouse pads  desktop plaques and puzzles 
photo prints consist of wallet  x  x  x  and large format sizes 
revenue from advertising displayed on our websites is also included in consumer revenues 
enterprise 
our enterprise revenues are primarily from variable  four color direct marketing collateral manufactured and fulfilled for business customers 
we continue to focus our efforts in expanding our presence in this market 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in particular  we generate a substantial portion of our revenues during the holiday season in the fourth quarter 
we also typically experience increases in net revenues during other shopping related seasonal events  such as easter  mother s day  father s day  and halloween 
we generally experience lower net revenues during the first  second and third calendar quarters and have incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
due to the relatively short lead time required to fulfill product orders  usually one to three business days  order backlog is not material to our business 
to further understand net revenue trends in our consumer category  we monitor several key metrics including  total customers  total number of orders  and average order value 
in the second quarter of  we changed our disclosures of these metrics to be the aggregate of all customers and orders across all our consumer brands  instead of our previous  separate disclosures of shutterfly and tiny prints customers and orders 
as a result  our average order value metric is also presented in the aggregate for all brands 
total customers 
we closely monitor total customers as a key indicator of demand 
total customers represents the number of transacting customers in a given period 
we seek to expand our customer base by empowering our existing customers with sharing and collaboration services such as shutterfly share sites  and by conducting integrated marketing and advertising programs 
total customers have increased on an annual basis for each year since inception and we expect this trend to continue 
total number of orders 
we closely monitor total number of orders as a leading indicator of net revenue trends 
we recognize net revenues associated with an order when the products have been shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
orders are typically processed and shipped within two business days after a customer places an order 
total number of orders has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate this trend to continue in the future 
average order value 
average order value is consumer net revenues for a given period divided by the total number of customer orders recorded during that same period 
beginning in  the level of competitive discounting significantly increased which impacted our average order value 
we believe that these competitor actions are not sustainable  but it is impractical to predict if or when they will cease 
as a result  we expect that our average order values may fluctuate on an annual basis 
the table below highlights the trends of each of these aggregated metrics  as they are now presented  for the last seven quarters covering the period since the tiny prints acquisition 
we have provided pro forma metrics covering the three month period ended june  as the acquisition of tiny prints closed on april  three months ended jun

 dec

 sep 
 dec 
 pro forma in thousands  except aov amounts customers orders average order value we believe the analysis of these metrics and others described below provides us with important information on our overall net revenue trends and operating results 
fluctuations in these metrics are not unusual and no single factor is determinative of our net revenues and operating results 

table of contents cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues consists primarily of direct materials the majority of which consists of paper  ink  and photo book covers  payroll and related expenses for direct labor  shipping charges  packaging supplies  distribution and fulfillment activities  rent for production facilities  depreciation of production equipment  and third party costs for photo based merchandise 
cost of net revenues also includes payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service  any third party software or patents licensed  as well as the amortization of acquired developed technology  capitalized website and software development costs  and patent royalties 
cost of net revenues also includes certain costs associated with facility closures and restructuring 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of technology and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues 
technology and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees and contractors engaged in the development and ongoing maintenance of our websites  infrastructure and software 
these expenses include depreciation of the computer and network hardware used to run our websites and store the customer data  as well as amortization of purchased software 
technology and development expense also includes co location  power and bandwidth costs 
sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for marketing programs  and personnel and related expenses for our customer acquisition  product marketing  business development  and public relations activities 
our marketing efforts consist of various online and offline media programs  such as e mail and direct mail promotions  the purchase of keyword search terms and various strategic alliances 
we depend on these efforts to attract customers to our service 
general and administrative expense includes general corporate costs  including rent for our corporate offices  insurance  depreciation on information technology equipment  and legal and accounting fees 
transaction costs are also included in general and administrative expense 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes personnel expenses of employees involved in executive  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and legal roles 
third party payment processor and credit card fees are also included in general and administrative expense and have historically fluctuated based on revenues during the period 
all of the payments we have received from our intellectual property license agreements have been included as an offset to general and administrative expense 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of costs associated with our five year syndicated credit facility that became effective in november interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net primarily consists of the interest earned on our cash and investment accounts 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states because we only operate within the united states 
in the current year  we have become subject to taxation in israel as a result of a corporate acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from consumer and enterprise product sales  net of applicable sales tax  upon shipment of fulfilled orders  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
customers place consumer product orders through our websites and pay primarily using credit cards 
enterprise customers are invoiced upon fulfillment 
shipping charged to customers is recognized as revenue at the time of shipment 
for gift card sales and flash deal promotions through group buying websites  we recognize revenue on a gross basis  as we are the primary obligor  when redeemed items are shipped 
revenues from sales of prepaid orders on our websites are deferred until shipment of fulfilled orders or until the prepaid period expires 
our share of revenue generated from our print to retail relationships  is recognized when orders are picked up by our customers at the respective retailer 
we provide our customers with a satisfaction guarantee whereby products can be returned within a day period for a reprint or refund 
we maintain an allowance for estimated future returns based on historical data 
the provision for estimated returns is included in accrued expenses 
during the year ended december   returns totaled approximately of net revenues and have been within management s expectations 
we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers in exchange for setting up an account and to encourage purchases 
such offers include free products and percentage discounts on current purchases 
discounts  when accepted by customers  are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are presented in net revenues 
production costs related to free products are included in cost of revenues upon redemption 
our advertising revenues are derived from the sale of online advertisements on our websites 
advertising revenues are recognized as impressions ie  the number of times that an advertisement appears in pages viewed by users of the company websites are delivered  as clicks which are generated each time users of our websites click through the advertisements to an advertiser s designated website are provided to advertisers  or ratably over the term of the agreement with the expectation that the advertisement will be delivered ratably over the contract period 
inventories 
our inventories consist primarily of paper  photo book covers and packaging supplies and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimate for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon management s review of utilization of inventories in light of projected sales  current market conditions and market trends 
fair value 
we record our financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the accounting standard for fair value provides a framework for measuring fair value  clarifies the definition of fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date 
the accounting standard establishes a three tier hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from one to sixteen years  and the amortization is allocated between cost of net revenues and operating expenses 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment on an annual basis during our fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
software and website development costs 
we capitalize costs associated with website development and software developed or obtained for internal use 
accordingly  payroll and payroll related costs and stock based compensation incurred in the development phase are capitalized and amortized over the product s estimated useful life  which is generally three years 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for our website are expensed as incurred 

table of contents income taxes 
we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded a valuation allowance against certain california deferred tax assets totaling million 
we believe that all other net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no additional valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which will impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change is made 
we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
we are required to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense 
to the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable  amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made 
stock based compensation expense 
we measure our stock based awards at fair value and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and restricted stock awards 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price using historical and implied volatility and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
the cost of restricted stock awards and performance based restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized for restricted stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
compensation expense associated with performance based restricted stock awards is recognized on an accelerated attribution model  and ultimately based on whether or not satisfaction of the performance criteria is probable 
if in the future  situations indicate that the performance criteria are not probable  then no further compensation cost will be recorded  and any previous costs will be reversed

table of contents next twelve months 
whether these resources are adequate to meet our liquidity needs beyond that period will depend on our growth  operating results and the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell debt or additional equity 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be in amounts or on terms acceptable to us

non gaap financial measures regulation g  conditions for use of non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures  and other sec regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non gaap financial information 
we closely monitor two financial measures  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow which meet the definition of non gaap financial measures 
we define adjusted ebitda as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation 
free cash flow is defined as adjusted ebitda less purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of software and website development costs 
management believes these non gaap financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing our profitability and liquidity that  when viewed with our gaap results  provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our earnings and cash flows 
refer below for a reconciliation of both adjusted ebitda and free cash flow to the most comparable gaap measure 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we believe that these non gaap measures provide useful information about our core operating results and thus are appropriate to enhance the overall understanding of our past financial performance and our prospects for the future 
these adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors a more complete understanding of our underlying operational results and trends and performance 
management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate our financial results  develop budgets  manage expenditures  and determine employee compensation 
the presentation of additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for or superior to net income loss or net income loss per share determined in accordance with gaap 
management strongly encourages shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure 
the table below shows the trend of adjusted ebitda and free cash flow as a percentage of net revenues for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  net revenues non gaap adjusted ebitda percentage of net revenues free cash flow percentage of net revenues we carefully manage our operating costs and capital expenditures  in order to make the strategic investments necessary to grow and strengthen our business  while at the same time increasing our adjusted ebitda profitability and improving our free cash flows 
over the last three years  our full year adjusted ebitda profitability has improved to million in from million in this continued growth in adjusted ebitda profitability resulted from increased demand for our products and services  scale efficiencies  and improvements from product mix 
the increase in adjusted ebitda is also driven by higher consumer revenue in as compared to prior years 
we also increased our free cash flow to million in from million in free cash flow has limitations due to the fact that it does not represent the residual cash flow for discretionary expenditures 
for example  free cash flow does not incorporate payments made on capital lease obligations or cash requirements to comply with 
table of contents debt covenants 
therefore  we believe that it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our reported consolidated financial statements

we also have various non cancelable operating leases for certain production equipment 
specifically  in   and  we entered into multiple non cancelable operating leases for new digital presses and finishing equipment with terms that expire in up to five years 

table of contents includes the estimated timing and amount of payments for rent for our newly leased production facility space in fort mill  south carolina 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies for further discussion 
includes co location agreements with third party hosting facilities that expire in as well as minimums under marketing agreements 
other than the obligations  liabilities and commitments described above  we have no significant unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments 
we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not have any undisclosed borrowings or debt and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we are  therefore  not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities will be allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether a quantitative assessment is necessary 
this guidance is effective for our interim and annual periods beginning january  adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk 
we have exposure to interest rate risk that relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our syndicated credit facility 
all of our cash equivalents are carried at market value 
we may draw funds from our syndicated credit facility under interest rates based on either the federal funds rate or the adjusted london interbank offered rate libo rate 
if these rates increase significantly  our costs to borrow these funds will also increase 
to date  we have not borrowed any funds under our syndicated credit facility 
as a result  we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our interest income and expense  operating results  or liquidity 
inflation 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our current business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  for example  if the cost of our materials or the cost of shipping our products to customers were to incur substantial increases as a result of the rapid rise in the cost of oil  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations
