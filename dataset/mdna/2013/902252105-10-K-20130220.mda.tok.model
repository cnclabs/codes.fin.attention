we believe there is a reasonable basis for our forward looking statements  but they are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from the expectations and beliefs reflected in the forward looking statements 
we presently consider the following to be among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs changes in the budgets or regulatory environments of our customers  primarily local and state governments  that could negatively impact information technology spending  our ability to protect client information from security breaches and provide uninterrupted operations of data centers  material portions of our business require the internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained  our ability to achieve our financial forecasts due to various factors  including project delays by our customers  reductions in transaction size  fewer transactions  delays in delivery of new products or releases or a decline in our renewal rates for service agreements  economic  political and market conditions  including the global economic and financial crisis  and the general tightening of access to debt or equity capital  technological and market risks associated with the development of new products or services or of new versions of existing or acquired products or services  our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and achieve growth or operational synergies through the integration of acquired businesses  while avoiding unanticipated costs and disruptions to existing operations  competition in the industry in which we conduct business and the impact of competition on pricing  customer retention and pressure for new products or services  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and dealing with the loss or retirement of key members of management or other key personnel  and costs of compliance and any failure to comply with government and stock exchange regulations

table of contents we monitor and analyze several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and evaluate our financial and operating performance 
these indicators include the following revenues we derive our revenues from five primary sources sale of software licenses  subscription based arrangements  software services  maintenance and appraisal services 
subscriptions and maintenance are considered recurring revenue sources and comprised approximately of our revenue in the number of new saas customers and the number of existing customers who convert from our traditional software arrangements to our saas model are a significant driver to our business  together with new software license sales and maintenance rate increases 
in addition  we also monitor our customer base and churn as we historically have experienced very low customer turnover 
during  our customer turnover was approximately 
cost of revenues and gross margins our primary cost component is personnel expenses in connection with providing software implementation  subscription based services  maintenance and support  and appraisal services to our customers 
we can improve gross margins by controlling headcount and related costs and by expanding our revenue base  especially from those products and services that produce incremental revenue with minimal incremental cost  such as software licenses  subscription based services  and maintenance and support 
our appraisal projects are cyclical in nature  and we often employ appraisal personnel on a short term basis to coincide with the life of a project 
as of december   our total employee count increased to  from  at december  this increase includes employees added as a result of acquisitions completed in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses the primary components of sg a expenses are administrative and sales personnel salaries and commissions  marketing expense  share based compensation expense  rent and professional fees 
sales commissions typically fluctuate with revenues and share based compensation expense generally increases when the market price of our stock increases 
other administrative expenses tend to grow at a slower rate than revenues 
liquidity and cash flows the primary driver of our cash flows is net income 
uses of cash include acquisitions  capital investments in property and equipment and discretionary purchases of treasury stock 
during we invested million in property and equipment and paid million in cash for four small acquisitions 
our investment in property and equipment included million in cash in connection with the construction of an office building in plano  texas and purchase of land and a building in moraine  ohio 
our working capital needs are fairly stable throughout the year with the significant components of cash outflows being payment of personnel expenses offset by cash inflows representing collection of accounts receivable and cash receipts from customers in advance of revenue being earned 
balance sheet cash  accounts receivable and days sales outstanding and deferred revenue balances are important indicators of our business 
acquisitions in november  we acquired all of the capital stock of energov solutions  llc energov which develops and sells enterprise permitting  land management  licensing and regulatory software solutions to governmental agencies 
the purchase price  net of cash acquired of  was million in cash and  shares of tyler common stock valued at million 
in april  we acquired all of the capital stock of computer software associates  inc csa for a cash purchase price of million  net of cash acquired of  csa is a reseller of tyler s infinite visions school enterprise solution  and sells proprietary csa tax and recording solutions to county governments  primarily in the northwest 
in march  we acquired all the capital stock of unifund  llc unifund for a cash purchase price of million  net of cash acquired of  unifund provides enterprise resource planning solutions to schools and local governments  primarily in the northeast 
unifund is also a reseller of tyler s infinite visions school enterprise solution 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of akanda innovation  inc  a provider of web based solutions to the public sector which are integrated with our property tax software  for a total purchase price of million 
the purchase price included certain liabilities we assumed of approximately  resulting in net cash paid to the sellers of million  of which  was paid prior to december  the operating results of these acquisitions are included in our results of operations since their dates of acquisition 
the operating results of energov  csa and unifund are included in the operating profit results of the ess segment and the operating results of akanda are included in the operating results of the atss segment 

table of contents outlook we expect the trend of gradual improvements in the marketplace to continue in we plan to make significant investments in our business that we believe will enhance our market leadership and improve long term revenue and margin growth 
these investments include expenses associated with new e filing contracts as well as accelerated hiring to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver our current backlog and anticipated new business 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues  cost of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosure of contingencies 
the notes to the financial statements included as part of this annual report describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the application of the percentage of completion and proportional performance methods of revenue recognition  the carrying amount and estimated useful lives of intangible assets  determination of share based compensation expense and valuation allowance for receivables 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition and asc  software revenue recognition 
our revenues are derived from sales of software licenses  subscription based services  appraisal services  maintenance and support  and services that typically range from installation  training and basic consulting to software modification and customization to meet specific customer needs 
for multiple element software arrangements  which do not entail the performance of services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software  we generally record revenue when the delivered products or performed services result in a legally enforceable and non refundable claim 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments  which are provided at the time the revenue is recognized 
because most of our customers are governmental entities  we rarely incur a loss resulting from the inability of a customer to make required payments 
in a limited number of cases  we encounter a customer who is dissatisfied with some aspect of the software product or our service  and we may offer a concession to such customer 
in those limited situations where we grant a concession  we rarely reduce the contract arrangement fee  but alternatively may perform additional services  such as additional training or creating additional custom reports 
these amounts have historically been nominal 
in connection with our customer contracts and the adequacy of related allowances and measures of progress towards contract completion  our project managers are charged with the responsibility to continually review the status of each customer on a specific contract basis 
also  we review  on at least a quarterly basis  significant past due accounts receivable and the adequacy of related reserves 
events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount for the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales adjustments may require revision  include  but are not limited to  deterioration of a customer s financial condition  failure to manage our customer s expectations regarding the scope of the services to be delivered  and defects or errors in new versions or enhancements of our software products 
we use contract accounting  primarily the percentage of completion method  as discussed in asc  construction type and certain production type contracts  for those software arrangements that involve significant production  modification or customization of the software  or where our software services are otherwise considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we measure progress to completion primarily using labor hours incurred  or value added 
in addition  we recognize revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition for our property appraisal projects  some of which can range up to five years 
these methods rely on estimates of total expected contract revenue  billings and collections and expected contract costs  as well as measures of progress toward completion 
we believe reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs and progress applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
at times  we perform additional and or non contractual services for little to no incremental fee to satisfy customer expectations 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing our estimates of expected costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  and any revisions are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision first become known 
in connection with these and certain other contracts  we may perform the work prior to when the services are billable and or payable pursuant to the contract 
the termination clauses in most of our contracts provide for the payment for the value of products delivered and services performed in the event of an early termination 

table of contents for saas arrangements  we evaluate whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and whether the customer can feasibly maintain the software on the customer s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software 
if we determine that the customer has the contractual right to take possession of our software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and can feasibly maintain the software on the customer s hardware or enter into another arrangement with a third party to host the software  we recognize the license  professional services and hosting services revenues pursuant to asc  software revenue recognition 
for saas arrangements that do not meet the criteria for recognition under asc  we account for the elements under asc  multiple element arrangements using all applicable facts and circumstances  including whether i the element has stand alone value  ii there is a general right of return and iii the revenue is contingent on delivery of other elements 
we allocate the contract value to each element of the arrangement that qualifies for treatment as a separate element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  and if vsoe is not available  third party evidence  and if third party evidence is unavailable  estimated selling price 
for professional services associated with saas arrangements that we determine do not have stand alone value to the customer or are contingent on delivery of other elements  we recognize the services revenue ratably over the remaining contractual period once hosting has gone live and we may begin billing for the hosting services 
we record amounts that have been invoiced in accounts receivable and in deferred revenue or revenues  depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met 
in connection with certain of our contracts  we have recorded retentions receivable or unbilled receivables consisting of costs and estimated profit in excess of billings as of the balance sheet date 
many of the contracts which give rise to unbilled receivables at a given balance sheet date are subject to billings in the subsequent accounting period 
we review unbilled receivables and related contract provisions to ensure we are justified in recognizing revenue prior to billing the customer and that we have objective evidence which allows us to recognize such revenue 
in addition  we have a sizable amount of deferred revenue which represents billings in excess of revenue earned 
the majority of this liability consists of maintenance billings for which payments are made in advance and the revenue is ratably earned over the maintenance period  generally one year 
we also have deferred revenue for those contracts in which we receive a deposit and the conditions in which to record revenue for the service or product has not been met 
on a periodic basis  we review by customer the detail components of our deferred revenue to ensure our accounting remains appropriate 
intangible assets and goodwill 
our business acquisitions typically result in the creation of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  and these balances affect the amount and timing of future period amortization expense  as well as expense we could possibly incur as a result of an impairment charge 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to identifiable tangible and intangible assets based on estimated fair value  with the excess allocated to goodwill 
accordingly  we have a significant balance of acquisition date intangible assets  including software  customer related intangibles  trade name and goodwill 
these intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we currently have no intangible assets with indefinite lives other than goodwill 
when testing goodwill for impairment quantitatively  we first compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment 
in the second step  we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized 
the fair values calculated in our impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving several assumptions 
the assumptions that are used are based upon what we believe a hypothetical marketplace participant would use in estimating fair value 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we evaluate the reasonableness of the fair value calculations of our reporting units by comparing the total of the fair value of all of our reporting units to our total market capitalization 
in the first quarter of  asu  testing goodwill for impairment became effective 
asu allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit ie  the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
if entities determine  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount  a quantitative calculation would not be needed 

table of contents our annual goodwill impairment analysis  which we performed quantitatively during the second quarter of  did not result in an impairment charge 
during we did not identify any triggering events which would require an update to our annual impairment review 
all intangible assets with definite and indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of other intangible assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the assessment of recoverability or of the estimated useful life for amortization purposes will be affected if the timing or the amount of estimated future operating cash flows is not achieved 
such indicators may include  among others a significant decline in expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  and reductions in growth rates 
in addition  products  capabilities  or technologies developed by others may render our software products obsolete or non competitive 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets 
share based compensation 
we have a stock option plan that provides for the grant of stock options to key employees  directors and non employee consultants 
we estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
share based compensation expense includes the estimated effects of forfeitures  which will be adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures are recognized in the period of change and will also impact the amount of expense to be recognized in future periods 
forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
we estimate stock price volatility at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
estimated option life is determined using the simplified method in accordance with asc  stock compensation 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates

table of contents compared to revenues software licenses 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our software license revenues for the years ended december change in thousands ess atss total software license revenue excluding the impact of acquisitions  total software license revenue declined by compared to most of the decline was due to fewer add on sales to our existing customer base 
in addition  software license growth was reduced somewhat because of a growing number of customers choosing our subscription based options  rather than purchasing the software under a traditional perpetual software license arrangement 
subscription based arrangements result in no software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional perpetual software license arrangements but generate higher overall subscription based services revenue over the term of the contract 
we had new customers that entered into subscription based arrangements in compared to new customers in we expect software license revenues in to be higher than but the mix of software license arrangements and subscription based arrangements may reduce the degree of the increase 
subscriptions 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our subscription revenues for the years ended december change in thousands ess atss total subscriptions revenue subscription based services revenue primarily consists of revenues derived from our saas arrangements  which utilize the tyler private cloud 
as part of our subscription based services  we also provide e filings that simplify the filing and management of court related documents for courts and law offices 
revenues for e filings are generally derived from transaction fees 
the contract term for saas arrangements range from one to years but are typically for a period of three to six years 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  subscription based services revenue increased compared to new saas customers as well as existing customers who converted to our saas model provided the majority of the subscription based revenue increase 
in  we added new customers and existing customers elected to convert to our saas model 
e filing services also contributed approximately million of the subscription revenue increase as a result of new clients implementing e filing and several existing clients adopting or expanding mandatory e filing for court documents in the last half of and 
table of contents software services 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our software services revenues for the years ended december change in thousands ess atss total software services revenue software services revenues primarily consists of professional services billed in connection with the installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and consulting 
new customers who purchase our proprietary software licenses generally also contract with us to provide for the related software services 
existing customers also periodically purchase additional training  consulting and minor programming services 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  software services increased compared to the increase is due partly to contract arrangements that included more programming services as well as several state wide arrangements that in addition to services  include more third party vendor services to build certain software interfaces 
maintenance 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our maintenance revenues for the years ended december change in thousands ess atss total maintenance revenue we provide maintenance and support services for our software products and certain third party software 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  maintenance revenue grew from this increase was due to growth in our installed customer base and maintenance rate increases on most of our product lines  offset slightly by customers converting to our saas model 
appraisal services 
the following table sets forth a comparison of our appraisal service revenues for the years ended december change in thousands ess atss total appraisal services revenue appraisal services revenue declined in compared to the appraisal services business is somewhat cyclical and driven in part by statutory revaluation cycles in various states 
the decline is mainly due to the completion of a large contract in pennsylvania offset slightly by the start up of smaller projects in  including several in ohio

table of contents cost of revenues and gross margins the following table sets forth a comparison of the key components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december change in thousands software licenses acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other total cost of revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of gross margin percentage by revenue type for the years ended december gross margin percentage change software license and acquired software software services  maintenance and subscriptions appraisal services hardware and other overall gross margin software license and acquired software 
costs of software license and acquired software are primarily comprised of third party software costs and amortization expense for software acquired through acquisitions 
in our software license gross margin percentage increased compared to because our product mix included less third party software which offset higher amortization expense associated with acquisitions 
software services  maintenance and subscription based services 
cost of software services  maintenance and subscription based services primarily consists of personnel costs related to installation of our software  conversion of customer data  training customer personnel and support activities and various other services such as saas arrangements and e filings 
maintenance and various other services such as saas costs typically grow at a slower rate than related revenues due to leverage in the utilization of our support and maintenance staff and economies of scale 
in  the software services  maintenance and subscriptions gross margin increased compared to the prior year partly because we improved our utilization of our support and maintenance staff and due to annual rate increases on certain services 
we are managing costs and staff levels to ensure they are in line with demand for professional services 
excluding employees added with acquisitions  our implementation and support staff has increased by employees since most of these additions occurred mid to late we expect to increase development efforts in for geographic expansion efforts  primarily in california and in our e filing solutions infrastructure in order to pursue more opportunities with both existing and new clients 
in late we signed a contract with the texas office of court administration for our odyssey file and serve e filing offering for texfile  a unified  statewide electronic filing system for courts 
subsequently  the state of texas issued an order mandating e filing in civil cases beginning in january mandatory e filing will be phased in over a two and a half year period  beginning with the largest counties in january we will be paid on a per filing basis but expect very limited revenues from texfile e filings in however  during we will invest significant amounts in the range of million  to prepare to implement the system with courts across the state 
with the recent order mandating e filing in texas  we expect that this contract will provide a long term recurring revenue stream of million to million when it becomes fully mandatory 

table of contents appraisal services

the appraisal services gross margin declined compared to a high proportion of the costs of appraisal services revenue are variable  as we often hire temporary employees to assist in appraisal projects  whose term of employment generally ends with the projects completion 
the appraisal services gross margin in was also favorably impacted by operational efficiencies associated with a large revaluation contract which began in mid and was substantially complete by mid our blended gross margin for increased from mainly due to leverage in the utilization of our support  maintenance and subscription based services staff and economies of scale and slightly higher rates on certain services 
the gross margin also benefited from lower third party software costs

the following table sets forth a comparison of our research and development expense for the years ended december change in thousands research and development expense research and development expense consist mainly of costs associated with development of new products and new software platforms from which we do not currently generate revenue 
these include the next version of microsoft dynamics ax project  as well as other new product development efforts 
in  we entered into a software development and license agreement  which provides for a strategic alliance with microsoft corporation microsoft to jointly develop core public sector functionality for microsoft dynamics ax to address the accounting needs of public sector organizations worldwide 
this agreement and subsequent amendments granted microsoft intellectual property rights in the software code provided and developed by tyler into microsoft dynamics ax products to be marketed and sold outside of the public sector in exchange for reimbursement payments to partially offset the research and development costs and royalties on direct and indirect public sector sales worldwide of the solutions co developed under this arrangement 
in addition  tyler has agreed to commit certain resources to the development of the next version of dynamics ax and will receive software and maintenance royalties on direct and indirect public sector sales worldwide of the solutions co developed under this arrangement 
our research and development expense increased million in compared to the increase is mainly due to lower reimbursements from microsoft in in we had million in research and development expense offsets compared to million in  which were the amounts earned under the terms of our agreement with microsoft 
under our amended agreement with microsoft  the project included offsets to research and development expense  varying in amount from quarter to quarter from through for a total of approximately million 
as of september   we received the final million under the agreement 

table of contents amortization of customer and trade name intangibles acquisition intangibles are comprised of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets acquired that is allocated to acquired software and customer and trade name intangibles 
the remaining excess purchase price is allocated to goodwill that is not subject to amortization 
amortization expense related to acquired software is included with cost of revenues  while amortization expense of customer and trade name intangibles is recorded as other operating expense 
the estimated useful lives of both customer and trade name intangibles are five to years 
the following table sets forth a comparison of amortization of customer and trade name intangibles for the years ended december change in thousands amortization of customer and trade name intangibles in  we completed several acquisitions that increased amortizable customer and trade name intangibles by approximately million

table of contents the effective income tax rates for both years were different from the statutory united states federal income tax rate of due to state income taxes  non deductible share based compensation expense  the qualified manufacturing activities deduction  disqualifying incentive stock option isos dispositions and non deductible meals and entertainment costs 
the effective income tax rate in was also reduced by a research and development tax credit 
the qualified manufacturing activities deduction declined in contributing to a higher effective tax rate 
approximately of our stock option expense is related to isos 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
non qualified stock options result in the creation of a deferred tax asset  which is a temporary difference  until the time that the option is exercised 
due to the treatment of isos for tax purposes  our effective tax rate from year to year is subject to variability

financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and investments available for sale of million  compared to cash and cash equivalents of million and investments available for sale of million at december  as of december   we had million in outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
some of our customers  primarily those for our property appraisal services  require that we secure performance bonds in connection with our contracts 
the maximum potential amount of an outstanding performance bond would be the remaining cost of work to be performed under our contracts 
the notional amount of performance guarantees outstanding as of december  was estimated to be million 
we provide letters of credit as security for the issuance of performance bonds 
we do not believe these letters of credit will be required to be drawn upon 
these letters of credit expire in we believe our million revolving line of credit provides us with sufficient flexibility to meet our long term financial needs 
the following table sets forth a summary of cash flows for the years ended december in thousands cash flows provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities continues to be our primary source of funds to finance operating needs and capital expenditures 
other potential capital resources include cash on hand  public and private issuances of debt or equity securities  and bank borrowings 
it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets in the future may be limited by economic conditions or other factors 
we currently believe that cash provided by operating activities  cash on hand and available credit are sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  income tax obligations  and share repurchases for at least the next twelve months 
in  operating activities provided net cash of million  primarily generated from net income of million  non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million and non cash share based compensation expense of million 
working capital  excluding cash  declined million mainly due to higher deferred revenue balances than due to an increase in annual software maintenance billings as a result of growth in our installed customer base 
in addition  our growth in subscription based arrangements has also contributed to larger deferred revenue balances 
the increase in deferred revenues was offset somewhat by higher accounts receivable balances from annual software maintenance billings 
in general  changes in the balance of deferred revenue are cyclical and primarily driven by the timing of our maintenance renewal billings 
our renewal dates occur throughout the year but our heaviest renewal cycles occur in the second and fourth quarters 

table of contents at december   our days sales outstanding dsos were days compared to dsos of days at december  dsos are calculated based on accounts receivable excluding long term receivables  but including unbilled receivables divided by the quotient of annualized quarterly revenues divided by days 
investments available for sale consist of two auction rate municipal securities ars which are collateralized debt obligations supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities 
these ars are debt instruments with stated maturities of to years  for which the interest rate is designed to be reset through dutch auctions approximately every days 
however  due to events in the credit markets  auctions for these securities have not occurred since february both of our ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period from july through july as of december  we have continued to earn and collect interest on both of our ars 
because quoted prices in active markets are no longer available we determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted trinomial model 
the model considers the probability of three potential occurrences for each auction event through the maturity date of each ars 
the three potential outcomes for each auction are i successful auction early redemption  ii failed auction and iii issuer default 
inputs in determining the probabilities of the potential outcomes include but are not limited to  the securities collateral  credit rating  insurance  issuer s financial standing  contractual restrictions on disposition and the liquidity in the market 
the fair value of each ars is determined by summing the present value of the probability weighted future principal and interest payments determined by the model 
since there can be no assurances that auctions for these securities will be successful in the near future  we have classified our ars as non current investments 
in connection with this estimate of fair value  we have recorded an after tax temporary unrealized gain on our non current ars of  net of related tax effects of  in  which is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our balance sheet 
we consider the impairment in our ars as temporary because we do not have the intent to sell  nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis 
we believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues  because the underlying assets of these securities are supported by municipal agencies and do not include mortgage backed securities  have redemption features which call for redemption at of par value and have a current credit rating of a or aa 
the ratings on the ars take into account credit support through insurance policies guaranteeing each of the bonds payment of principal and accrued interest  if it becomes necessary 
in addition  both ars have had very small partial redemptions at par in the period july through july based on our cash and cash equivalents balance  expected operating cash flows and a million revolving credit line  we do not believe a lack of liquidity associated with our ars will adversely affect our ability to conduct business  and believe we have the ability to hold the securities throughout the currently estimated recovery period 
we will continue to evaluate any changes in the fair value of our ars and in the future  depending upon existing market conditions  we may be required to record an other than temporary decline in market value
