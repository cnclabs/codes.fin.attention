we also could be adversely affected by  among other things  changes in the delivery or pricing of or reimbursement for medical devices 
other provisions of this law as currently enacted  including an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies  could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
further  we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level  or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the us or internationally 
however  any changes that lower reimbursements for our products  reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or other participants in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
new regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals  known as conflict minerals  originating from the democratic republic of congo drc and adjoining countries 
as a result  in august the sec adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the drc and adjoining countries in their products 
these new requirements will require due diligence efforts in fiscal  with initial disclosure requirements beginning in may there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements  including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products  processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities 
the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing  supply and pricing of materials used in our products 
as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict free conflict minerals  we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices 
also  we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement 
we have a history of fluctuating operating results  including net losses in fiscal and and we may not be able to return to profitability in the future  which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline

the company evaluates estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that may be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following areas are considered to be the company s most significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time products are shipped and title has transferred  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract executed  there are not uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales discounts  returns and allowances are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  it is the company s practice to include revenues generated from freight billed to customers in net sales with corresponding freight expense included in cost of sales in the statement of operations 
the company reports sales taxes on sales transactions on a net basis in the statement of operations  and therefore does not include sales taxes in revenues or costs 
the sales price is fixed by the company s acceptance of the buyer s firm purchase order 
the sales price is not contingent  or subject to additional discounts 
the company s standard shipment terms are fob shipping point as stated in the company s terms and conditions of sale 
the customer is responsible for obtaining insurance for and bears the risk of loss for product in transit 
additionally  sales to customers do not include the right to return merchandise without the prior consent of the company 
in those cases where returns are accepted  product must be current and restocking fees must be paid by the respective customer 
a provision has been made for estimated sales returns and allowances 
these estimates are based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns 
the company does not provide installation services for its products 
most products shipped are ready for immediate use by the customer 
the company s in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls do require installation by the customer 
these products are typically purchased by a third party contractor who is ultimately responsible for installation services 
accordingly  the customer purchase order or contract does not require customer acceptance of the installation prior to completion of the sale transaction and revenue recognition 
the company s standard payment terms are net days from the date of shipment  and payment is specifically not subject to customer inspection or acceptance  as stated in the company s terms and conditions of sale 
the buyer becomes obligated to pay the company at the time of shipment 
the company requires credit applications from its customers and performs credit reviews to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
the company requires letters of credit  where warranted  for international transactions 
the company also protects its legal rights under mechanics lien laws when selling to contractors 
the company does offer limited warranties on its products

inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand 
this analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine  in management s best estimate  if parts can be used beyond one year  if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for 
at june  and  inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the fasb accounting standards codification asc topic income taxes 
under asc  the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
management uses a more likely than not criterion in its assessment and considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is needed 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance the company first considers the reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies 
to the extent these items are not sufficient to cause the realization of deferred tax assets  the company would then consider the availability of future taxable income only to the extent such income is considered likely to occur based on the company s earnings history  current income trends and projections 
the company currently relies on reversals of existing temporary deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies to support the value of existing deferred tax assets 
as of june  using currently available strategies there remains approximately  of future taxable income which would be generated through the strategies and available to offset future net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
to the extent future losses for the fiscal year exceed this amount the company would not be able to continue to recognize the tax benefit of future losses 
accounts receivable net of allowances accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts including accounts placed with collection agencies  and an allowance for returns and credits  which is based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks indentified among uncollected accounts 
accounts receivable are charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts when the company determines that the receivable will not be collected and or when the account has been referred to a third party collection agency 
at june  and  accounts receivable is recorded net of allowances of  valuation of long lived assets the impairment of long lived assets is assessed when changes in circumstances such as  but not limited to  a decrease in market value of an asset  current and historical operating losses or a change in business strategy indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this assessment is based on management s expectations and judgments regarding future business and economic conditions  future market values and disposal costs 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management s estimates 
based upon our most recent analysis  we believe that no impairment exists at june  there can be no assurance that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to net earnings loss 
self insurance the company maintains a self insurance program for a portion of its health care costs 
self insurance costs are accrued based upon the aggregate of the liability for reported claims and the estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported

the credit facility was amended on november  extending the maturity date to november   reducing the borrowing availability from  to  and removing covenants related to the achievement of certain financial ratios 
the credit facility will be available on a revolving basis until it expires on november   at which time all amounts outstanding under the credit facility will be due and payable 
advances under the credit facility will be made pursuant to a revolving credit note executed by the company in favor of enterprise bank trust

among other things  such covenants restrict the company s ability to incur certain additional debt  make specified restricted payments  dividends and capital expenditures  authorize or issue capital stock  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  consolidate or merge with or acquire another business  sell certain of its assets or dissolve or wind up the company 
the credit agreement also contains certain events of default that are customary for financings of this type including  without limitation the failure to pay principal  interest  fees or other amounts when due  the breach of specified representations or warranties contained in the loan documents  cross default with certain other indebtedness of the company  the entry of uninsured judgments that are not bonded or stayed  failure to comply with the observance or performance of specified agreements contained in the loan documents  commencement of bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings  and the failure of any of the loan documents entered into in connection with the credit facility to be in full force and effect
