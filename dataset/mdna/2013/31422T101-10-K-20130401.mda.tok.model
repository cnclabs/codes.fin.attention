item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are an insurance holding company that controls substantially all steps in the insurance underwriting  distribution and claims processes through our subsidiaries and our contractual relationships with our independent agents and general agents 
we are authorized to underwrite  and or place through our wholly owned subsidiaries  homeowners multi peril homeowners  commercial general liability  federal flood  personal auto and various other lines of insurance in florida and various other states 
we market and distribute our own and third party insurers products and our other services through a network of independent agents 
we also utilize a select number of general agents for the same purpose 
our primary insurance subsidiary is federated national insurance company fnic 
fnic is licensed as an admitted carrier in florida 
an admitted carrier is an insurance company that has received a license from the state insurance regulator for authority to write specific lines of insurance in that state 
through contractual relationships with a network of approximately  independent agents  of which approximately actively sell and service our products  fnic is authorized to underwrite homeowners  commercial general liability  fire  allied lines and personal and commercial automobile insurance in florida 
fnic is also licensed as an admitted carrier in alabama  louisiana  georgia and texas  and underwrites commercial general liability insurance in those states and personal automobile insurance in georgia and texas 
fnic operates as a non admitted carrier in arkansas  california  kentucky  maryland  missouri  nevada  oklahoma  south carolina  tennessee and virginia  and can underwrite commercial general liability insurance in all of these states 
a non admitted carrier  sometimes referred to as a excess and surplus lines carrier  is permitted to do business in a state and  although it is strictly regulated to protect policyholders from a variety of illegal and unethical practices  including fraud  non admitted carriers are subject to considerably less regulation with respect to policy rates and forms 
non admitted carriers are not required to financially contribute to and benefit from the state guarantee fund  which is used to pay for losses if an insurance carrier becomes insolvent or unable to pay the losses due their policyholders 
in january  we merged fnic and our other wholly owned insurance subsidiary  american vehicle insurance company american vehicle  with fnic continuing the operations of both entities 
in connection with this merger  the company  fnic and american vehicle entered into a consent order with the florida office of insurance regulation florida oir pursuant to which we agreed to certain restrictions on our business operations 
the consent order was amended in february to lessen or eliminate certain of the original requirements  due to fnic s statutory underwriting profit during see regulation consent order 
we internally process claims made by our insureds through our wholly owned claims adjusting company  federated national adjusting  inc fna  formerly known as superior adjusting  inc until june  we offered premium financing to our own and third party insureds through our wholly owned subsidiary  federated premium finance  inc federated premium 
federated national underwriters  inc fnu  formerly known as assurance managing general agents  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acts as fnic s exclusive managing general agent in florida and is also licensed as a managing general agent in the states of alabama  georgia  illinois  louisiana  north carolina  mississippi  missouri  new york  nevada  south carolina  texas and virginia 
fnu has contracted with several unaffiliated insurance companies to sell commercial general liability  workers compensation  personal umbrella  inland marine and other various lines of insurance through fnu s existing network of agents 
fnu earns commissions and fees for providing policy administration  marketing  accounting and analytical services  and for participating in the negotiation of reinsurance contracts 
fnu earns a per policy fee  and traditionally a commission fee from its affiliate  fnic 
during the fourth quarter of  fnu  pursuant to the consent order as discussed above  reduced its fee  to earn amounts varying between and  which we anticipate will return to at an unknown future date with approval from the florida oir 
a formal agreement reflecting this fee modification was executed during january although we are authorized to underwrite the various lines described above  our business is primarily underwriting homeowners policies 
during    and of the premiums we underwrote were for homeowners  commercial general liability  federal flood  and personal automobile insurance  respectively 
during    and of the premiums we underwrote were for homeowners  commercial general liability  federal flood  and personal automobile insurance  respectively 

table of contents federated national holding company management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opearations during the years ended december   or  we did not experience any weather related catastrophic events such as the hurricanes that occurred in florida during and we are not able to predict how hurricanes or other insurable events will affect our future results of operations and liquidity 
loss and loss adjustment expenses lae are affected by a number of factors  many of which are partially or entirely beyond our control  including the following 
the nature and severity of the loss  weather related patterns  the availability  cost and terms of reinsurance  underlying settlement costs  including medical and legal costs  legal and political factors such as legislative initiatives and public opinion  macroeconomic issues 
our business  results of operations and financial condition are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors 
abnormally high severity or frequency of claims in any period could have a material adverse effect on us 
when our estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and lae are less than the actuarially determined amounts  we increase the expense in the current period 
conversely  when our estimated liabilities for unpaid losses and lae are greater than the actuarially determined amounts  we decrease the expense in the current period 
our goal in our reinsurance strategy is to equalize the liquidity requirements imposed by most severe insurable events and by all other insurable events we manage in the normal course of business 
please see reinsurance agreements under item business for a more detailed description of our reinsurance agreements and strategy 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our financial statements include estimates associated with management s evaluation of the determination of i liability for unpaid losses and lae  ii the amount and recoverability of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs dpac  and iii estimates for our reserves with respect to finance contracts  premiums receivable and deferred income taxes 
various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of these significant estimates  which are described in greater detail in footnote in this form k 
except as described below  we believe that in there were no significant changes in those critical accounting policies and estimates 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates and their disclosure in this form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  and in the case of unpaid losses and lae  an actuarial valuation 
management regularly reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
in selecting the best estimate  we utilize various actuarial methodologies 
each of these methodologies is designed to forecast the number of claims we will be called upon to pay and the amounts we will pay on average to settle those claims 
in arriving at our best estimate  our actuaries consider the likely predictive value of the various loss development methodologies employed in light of underwriting practices  premium rate changes and claim settlement practices that may have occurred  and weight the credibility of each methodology 
our actuarial methodologies take into account various factors  including  but not limited to  paid losses  liability estimates for reported losses  paid allocated lae  salvage and other recoveries received  reported claim counts  open claim counts and counts for claims closed with and without payment for loss 
accounting for loss contingencies pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance involves the existence of a condition  situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future event s occur or fail to occur 
additionally  accounting for a loss contingency requires management to assess each event as probable  reasonably possible or remote 
probable is defined as the future event or events are likely to occur 
reasonably possible is defined as the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than probable  while remote is defined as the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight 
an estimated loss in connection with a loss contingency shall be recorded by a charge to current operations if both of the following conditions are met first  the amount can be reasonably estimated  and second  the information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements 
it is implicit in this condition that it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the loss or incurrence of a liability 

table of contents federated national holding company management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opearations fasb issued guidance addresses accounting and reporting for a investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and b all investments in debt securities 
the guidance requires that these securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  trading  or available for sale securities 
investments classified as held to maturity include debt securities wherein the company s intent and ability are to hold the investment until maturity 
the accounting treatment for held to maturity investments is to carry them at amortized cost without consideration to unrealized gains or losses 
investments classified as trading securities include debt and equity securities bought and held primarily for the sale in the near term 
the accounting treatment for trading securities is to carry them at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in current period operations 
investments classified as available for sale include debt and equity securities that are not classified as held to maturity or as trading security investments 
the accounting treatment for available for sale securities is to carry them at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  namely other comprehensive income 
overview of management s loss reserving process the company s loss reserves can generally be categorized into two distinct groups 
one group is short tail classes of business consisting principally of property risks in connection with homes and automobiles 
the other group is long tail casualty classes of business which include primarily commercial general liability and to a much lesser extent  homeowner and automobile liability 
for operations writing short tail coverages our loss reserves were generally geared toward determining an expected loss ratio for current business rather than maintaining a reserve for the outstanding exposure 
estimations of ultimate net loss reserves for long tail casualty classes of business is a more complex process and depends on a number of factors including class and volume of business involved 
experience in the more recent accident years of long tail casualty classes of business shows limited statistical credibility in reported net losses because a relatively low proportion of net losses would be reported claims and expenses and even smaller percentage would be net losses paid 
therefore  incurred but not yet reported ibnr would constitute a relatively high proportion of net losses 
additionally  the different methodologies are utilized the same  regardless of the line of business 
however  the final selection of ultimate loss and lae is certain to vary by both line of business and by accident period maturity 
there is no prescribed combination of line of business  accident year maturity  and methodologies  consistency in results of the different methodologies and reasonableness of the result are the primary factors that drive the final selection of ultimate loss and lae 
methods used to estimate loss and lae reserves the methods we use for our short tail business do not differ from the methods we use for our long tail business 
the incurred and paid development methods intrinsically recognize the unique development characteristics contained within the historical experience of each material short tail and long tail line of business 
the incurred and paid cape cod methods reflect similar historical development unique to each material short tail and long tail line of business 
we apply the following general methods in projecting loss and lae reserves paid and incurred loss development method paid and incurred bornhuetter ferguson incurred method frequency severity method 
table of contents federated national holding company management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opearations description of ultimate loss estimation methods the estimated ultimate loss and defense and cost containment expense dcce is based on an analysis by line of business  coverage and by accident quarter performed using data as of december  the analysis relies primarily on four actuarial methods incurred lossand dcce development method  paid loss and dcce development method  bornhuetter ferguson incurred method  and bornhuetter ferguson paid method 
each method relies on company experience  and  where relevant  the analysis includes comparisons to industry experience 
the following is a description of each of these methods incurred loss and dcce development method this reserving method is based on the assumption that the historical incurred loss and dcce development pattern as reflected by the company is appropriate for estimating the future loss dcce development 
incurred paid plus case amounts separated by accident quarter of occurrence and at quarterly evaluations are used in this analysis 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at all stages of maturity 
historical age to age loss development factors were calculated to measure the relative development of an accident quarter from one maturity point to the next 
loss and dcce development factors ldf are selected based on a review of the historical relationships between incurred loss dcce at successive valuations and based on industry patterns 
the ldfs are multiplied together to derive cumulative ldf s that  when multiplied by actual incurred loss and dcce  produce estimates of ultimate loss and dcce 
paid loss dcce development method this method is similar to the incurred loss dcce development method only paid loss dcce and paid patterns are substituted for the incurred loss dcce and incurred patterns 
bornhuetter ferguson incurred method this reserving method combines estimated initial expected unreported loss dcce with the actual loss dcce to yield the ultimate loss dcce estimate 
expected unreported loss dcce are equal to expected total loss dcce times the expected unreported percentage of loss dcce for each policy year 
the incurred loss dcce emergence pattern used to determine the unreported percentages in our projections is based on the selected ldf s from the incurred loss dcce development method described above 
the estimate of initial expected total loss dcce is based on the historical loss ratio for more mature accident years 
while this approach reduces the independence of the bornhuetter ferguson method from the loss dcce development methods for older policy years  it is used primarily for estimating ultimate loss dcce for more recent  less mature  policy years 
bornhuetter ferguson paid method this method is similar to the bornhuetter ferguson incurred method only paid loss dcce and paid patterns are substituted for the incurred loss dcce and incurred patterns 
we select an estimate of ultimate loss dcce for each accident quarter after considering the results of each projection method for the quarter and the relative maturity of the quarter the time elapsed between the start of the quarter and december  
reserves for unpaid losses dcce for each quarter are the differences between these ultimate estimates and the amount already paid 
the reserves for each quarter and each coverage are summed  and the result is the overall estimate of unpaid losses dcce liability for the company 
we also produce an estimate of unpaid adjusting and other expense a o  as a reserve is required under statutory accounting principles sap even if this expense has been pre paid or with an unconsolidated affiliate 
although we do not prepay for a o  the majority of the a o incurred is with an affiliated company and eliminated under the accounting principles for consolidation 
the unpaid a o is added to unpaid losses dcce  resulting in total unpaid losses and lae 
the validity of the results from using a loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  a shift between single and multiple claim payments  legal changes  or variations in a company s mix of business from year to year 
also  since the percentage of losses paid for immature years is often low  development factors can be volatile 
a small variation in the number of claims paid can have a leveraging effect that could lead to significant changes in estimated ultimate values 
accordingly  our reserves are estimates because there are uncertainties inherent in the determination of ultimate losses 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past as well as create uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends 
we compute our estimated ultimate liability using the most appropriate principles and procedures applicable to the lines of business written 
however  because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents federated national holding company management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opearations frequency severity method this method separately estimates the two components of ultimate losses the frequency  or number of claims and the severity  or cost per claim and then combines the resulting estimates in a multiplicative fashion to estimate ultimate losses 
the approach is valuable because sometimes there is more inherent stability in the frequency and severity data when viewed separately than in the total losses 
we developed reported claim counts to ultimate levels using the development approach 
the mechanics of this approach are the same as we described previously for paid and incurred losses 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates 
then we developed accident year incurred severities incurred losses divided by reported claim counts to ultimate levels using the development approach 
we trended these severities to accident year levels 
trend rates were selected based on a review of historical severities 
selected severity was chosen based on judgment considering the developed severities and the trended severities  considering industry benchmarks for each segment 
the loss alae  claim count and severity triangles are evaluated as of months  months  months etc 
we selected loss development factors based on the loss development history  to the extent credible  and supplemented with industry data where appropriate 
a key assumption underlying the estimation of the reserve for loss and lae is that past experience serves as the most reliable estimator of future events 
this assumption may materially affect the estimates when the insurance market  the regulatory environment  the legal environment  the economic environment  the book of business  the claims handling department  or other factors known or unknown have varied over time during the experience period and or will vary expectedly or unexpectedly in the future 
changes in estimates  or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid  are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made 
therefore  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and lae will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the following describes the extent of our procedures for determining the reserve for loss and lae on both an annual and interim reporting basis annually our policy is to select a single point estimate that best reflects our in house actuarial determination for unpaid losses and lae 
our independent actuarial firm  examining the exact same data set  will independently select a point estimate which determines a high point and low point range 
both processes rely on objective and subjective determinations 
if our point estimate falls within the range determined from the point estimate of our actuary  then the company s policy has been that no adjustments by management would be required 
in consideration thereof  the company does not have a policy for adjusting the liability for unpaid losses and lae to an amount that is different than an amount set forth within the range determined by our independent actuary  although the reserve level ultimately determined by us may not be the mid point of our independent actuary s range 
further  there can be no assurances that our actual losses will be within our actuary s range 
our independent actuary s report expressly states that the report is based on assumptions developed from its own analysis and based on information provided by management and that notwithstanding its analysis  there is a significant risk of material adverse deviation from its range 
interim during our interim approach was very similar to the annual process noted above 
a number of other actuarial assumptions are generally made in the review of reserves for each class of business 
for each class of business  expected ultimate loss ratios for each accident year are estimated based on loss reserve development patterns 
the expected loss ratio generally reflects the projected loss ratio from prior accident years  adjusted for the loss trend and the effect of rate changes and other quantifiable factors on the loss ratio 
in practice there are factors that change over time  however  many such as inflation are intrinsically reflected in the historical development patterns  and others typically do not materially affect the estimate of the reserve for unpaid losses and lae 
therefore  no specific adjustments have been incorporated for such contingencies projecting future development of losses and lae 
there are no key assumptions as of december  premised on future emergence inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns

we are required to review the contractual terms of all our reinsurance purchases to ensure compliance with fasb issued guidance 
the guidance establishes the conditions required for a contract with a reinsurer to be accounted for as reinsurance and prescribes accounting and reporting standards for those contracts 
contracts that do not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer may realize a significant loss from the insurance risk assumed generally do not meet the conditions for reinsurance accounting and must be accounted for as deposits 
the guidance also requires us to disclose the nature  purpose and effect of reinsurance transactions  including the premium amounts associated with reinsurance assumed and ceded 
it also requires disclosure of concentrations of credit risk associated with reinsurance receivables and prepaid reinsurance premiums

investments classified as held to maturity include debt securities wherein the company s intent and ability are to hold the investment until maturity and are carried at amortized cost without consideration to unrealized gains or losses 
investments classified as trading securities include debt and equity securities bought and held primarily for sale in the near term and are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in current period operations 
investments classified as available for sale include debt and equity securities that are not classified as held to maturity or as trading security investments and are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of shareholders equity  namely other comprehensive income

based on this evaluation and the company s ability and intent to hold these investments for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value  the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  
table of contents federated national holding company management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of opearations the million of unrealized losses from debt securities is related to us government bonds 
the company does not expect to settle at prices less than the amortized cost basis 
the company does not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  because we neither currently intend to sell these investments nor consider it likely that we will be required to sell these investments before recovery of the amortized cost basis 
fasb has also issued guidance regarding when an investment is considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and the measurement of an impairment loss 
management periodically reviews the individual investments that comprise our portfolio in order to determine whether a decline in fair value below our cost either is other than temporarily or permanently impaired 
factors used in such consideration include the extent and length of time over which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and our ability and intent to keep the investment for a period sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
in reaching a conclusion that a security is either other than temporarily or permanently impaired  we also consider such factors as the timeliness and completeness of expected dividends  principal and interest payments  ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating organizations such as standard and poor s s p and moody s investors service  inc moody s  as well as information released via the general media channels

table of contents federated national holding company management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we offer direct billing in connection with our homeowners  commercial general liability and automobile programs 
direct billing is an agreement in which the insurance company accepts from the insured  as a receivable  a promise to pay the premium  as opposed to requiring the full amount of the policy at policy inception  either directly from the insured or from a premium finance company 
the advantage of direct billing a policyholder by the insurance company is that we are not reliant on a credit facility  but remain able to charge and collect interest from the policyholder 
we believe that our current capital resources will be sufficient to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements 
there can be no assurances  however  that such will be the case 
we continue to evaluate our liquidity and the possibility that we may require additional working capital 
fnic s statutory capital surplus as of december  was approximately million and its statutory net income in was million 
fnic s statutory capital surplus as of december  was approximately million and its statutory net income in was million 
as of december    and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which were established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  management believes that we currently are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in transactions of that type requiring disclosure herein 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this annual report have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
our primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the inflationary effect on the cost of paying losses and lae 
insurance premiums are established before we know the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses 
consequently  we attempt to anticipate the future impact of inflation when establishing rate levels 
while we attempt to charge adequate premiums  we may be limited in raising premium levels for competitive and regulatory reasons 
inflation may also affect the market value of our investment portfolio and the investment rate of return 
any future economic changes that result in prolonged and increasing levels of inflation could cause increases in the dollar amount of incurred losses and lae and thereby materially adversely affect future liability requirements
