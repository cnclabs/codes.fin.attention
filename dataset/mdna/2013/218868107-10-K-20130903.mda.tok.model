item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges with  students in states and the province of ontario  canada 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company had net revenues of  million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenues pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues increased million or from  million in fiscal to  million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a increase in the average revenue rate per student offset partially by a decrease in the average student population during the period 
the decline in average student population was largely due to the loss of atb students in the everest ground schools 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student enrollments typically occur several times per month in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level diploma  associate  bachelor or master degree and the specific 
table of contents curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
most of our schools in the united states have historically accepted non high school graduates who can demonstrate an ability to benefit atb students from the program by passing certain tests which are required by ed 
serving atb students has historically been part of the company mission 
however  atb students are a higher risk population who complete their programs at a lower rate and default on their student loans at a higher rate than high school graduates 
accordingly  given the shift to a year default measurement period and the structural changes in student lending  we stopped enrolling atb students into our us everest and wyotech institutions on september  due to the success of our default prevention initiatives  we resumed enrolling atb students on a more limited basis in june however  the consolidated appropriations act of eliminated federal student aid eligibility for all students without a certificate of graduation from a school providing secondary education or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate 
a student who does not possess a high school diploma  or a recognized equivalent  but who is enrolled in a title iv eligible program any time prior to july  may be eligible to receive title iv student assistance after july  as of june   atb students accounted for approximately of total enrollments in our us schools 
to help offset the loss of atb students associated with funding restrictions in the appropriations act  we are offering free general education development ged preparation services to the general public 
we currently offer ged services at most of our us campuses 
we believe that some portion of students who obtain a ged through one of our schools could potentially enroll in one of our programs or pursue other post secondary education 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  insurance self insurance  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  assets and liabilities held for sale  contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates is as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts notes receivable agings and applying various expected loss percentages to student accounts notes receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience and consideration of the current economic environment 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we 
table of contents believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
the effect of an increase in our accounts receivable allowance of of our outstanding receivables from to or million to million would result in a decrease in pre tax income from continuing operations of million for the year ended june  the effect of an increase in our student notes receivable allowance of of our outstanding earned notes receivable from to or million to million would result in a decrease in pre tax income from continuing operations of million for the year ended june  many of our students in the us participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government 
the guaranteed loans are not guaranteed by us  and the guaranteed student loans cannot become an obligation of ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
however  if an institution former students default rate on guaranteed loans the cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to their eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years under current calculations  the institution students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
insurance self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including claims related to employee health care  workers compensation  general liability  and business interruption 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based on  among other things  historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the company loss exposure related to self insurance is limited by stop loss coverage 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets 
we consider a number of factors  including valuations and appraisals from independent valuation firms  in determining the amounts that are assignable to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  accreditation  and trade names 
we  however  are ultimately responsible for the valuations 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is derived using accepted valuation methodologies  including cost  market  and income approaches  as appropriate  following consultations with valuation firms and the requirements set forth by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice 
we do not amortize goodwill  accreditation  or trade names as these assets meet the indefinite life criteria within the accounting standards 
curricula are amortized over their useful lives ranging generally from five to fifteen years and the amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents goodwill is tested annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or earlier in the year upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill is more likely than not to be impaired 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is required to be performed at the level referred to as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
we perform the goodwill impairment test one level below the operating segment level 
fiscal at june   we have million of goodwill  million relating to the heald reporting unit and million relating to the quickstart intelligence corporation quickstart acquisition 
see note business acquisitions and dispositions 
our fiscal year annual impairment tests did not result in an impairment charge 
however  goodwill impairment assessments of the heald goodwill related to the heald acquisition involve significant judgments related to future revenues and earnings 
for heald  we assumed a wacc of  revenue growth rates ranging from to for fiscal to and a terminal growth rate of  which resulted in fair value exceeding carrying value by approximately 
these assumptions reflect the lower risk of heald relative to the everest schools resulting from less exposure to atb students and less regulatory uncertainty 
although we believe the estimates made are reasonable and supportable in connection with the impairment analysis  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and result in future impairments 
should our stock price remain depressed or decline further  we could incur additional goodwill impairment charges to write down all or a portion of our goodwill 
additionally  the fair value measure of accounting for financial instruments established a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
level is defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring and entity to develop it own assumptions 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined using level inputs included in our discounted cash flow valuation method 
fiscal our fiscal year annual impairment tests did not result in an impairment charge 
for heald  we assumed a wacc of  revenue growth rates ranging from to for fiscal to and a terminal growth rate of  which resulted in fair value exceeding carrying value by approximately 
fiscal during fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million due to a substantial decline in market capitalization 
we believe that regulatory uncertainties  and the potential impact of new regulations  particularly regulations regarding gainful employment  had a sustained negative impact on our stock price  and  consequently  our market capitalization 
during the second quarter of fiscal  our market capitalization was below book value of our net assets  which we considered an indicator of impairment 
consequently  we performed an interim impairment test on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is required to be performed at the level referred to as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
we performed the goodwill impairment test one level below the operating segment level 
the results of the interim impairment test indicated that the fair value of two of our reporting units with identified goodwill of million was less than their carrying value 
the goodwill of these two reporting units relates to everest schools located in north america 
accordingly  
table of contents we estimated the implied fair value of the goodwill of these reporting units by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value allocated to goodwill 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that the current fair value of the goodwill in these reporting units was  and accordingly recorded an impairment charge of million  the majority of which was nondeductible for tax purposes 
we determined the fair value of the reporting units using an equal weighting of an income approach  based on discounted cash flow dcf  and a market based approach 
the dcf incorporated our cash flow projections and a terminal value 
this amount was then discounted using a weighted average cost of capital wacc which considered our costs of debt and equity 
we then reconciled the calculated fair value of the reporting units to our market capitalization  including a reasonable premium  as another consideration in assessing fair value 
in establishing the wacc  consideration is given to specific regulatory risks related to each reporting unit  including the impact of our decision with respect to enrolling ability to benefit students 
our cash flow projections incorporate our best estimate of potential future changes related to gainful employment 
however  further negative developments in the regulatory environment could impact future assessments and result in impairments of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in addition  impairment assessments involve significant judgments related to future revenues and earnings 
although we believe we have made reasonable and supportable estimates in connection with its impairment analysis  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and result in future impairments 
we believe the underlying reason for the million impairment charge during fiscal resulted from continued uncertainty in the regulatory environment which resulted in an increase in business risk  particularly in the everest schools 
accordingly we increased the wacc used in the impairment testing to reflect such risk  which reduced the present value of discounted cash flows and resulted in the impairment charge 
the business risk related to the uncertainty in the regulatory environment remains an influence on our stock price 
the forecasted operating results continue to reflect the impact of discontinuing the enrollment of atb students as discussed within the background and overview section of management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the magnitude of the impairment charge is partially driven by changes in the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of accreditation 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 business combinations in july  we did not allocate value to other indefinite lived assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts  regardless of acquisition date 
accordingly  the impairment test allocates fair market value to indefinite lived intangible assets acquired prior to july  that were never assigned carrying value 
this assignment of value to these indefinite lived intangible assets for valuation purposes resulted in additional goodwill impairment as a carrying value was not allocated to these assets at the date of acquisition 
the average wacc  terminal growth rate  and revenue growth rate used to determine the fair value of the reporting units that incurred goodwill impairment at december  were   and  respectively 

table of contents intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts 
to the extent the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
when testing for impairment  we calculate the present value of its estimates of the future cash flows expected to be received from the assets tested and compares this result to the carrying value of the assets tested 
if the resulting amount was below the carrying value of the related assets  we would consider the assets to be impaired and take a charge to write down those assets to fair value 
the determination of estimated useful lives of definite lived intangible assets and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
although we believe the goodwill and intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to asset balances 
accreditation is required for an institution to be eligible to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
the process of obtaining accreditation and access to title iv funds is a barrier to entry for the industry 
the process of applying for accreditation is a time intensive and expensive process  whereby an institution is required to operate without eligibility to title iv funds for several years 
for the fiscal year  our institutions derived the majority of their revenues from title iv programs  and we as a whole derived approximately of our net us revenue from title iv programs 
we used the with and without method in valuing accreditation both upon acquisition and in the performance of our impairment analysis  which estimates the fair value of an asset as the present value of differential cash flows between two scenarios 
as it was applied to the fair valuation of accreditation  the with component reflects the present value of the as is cash flows  while the without component of the analysis assumes the initial grant of accreditation  and the hypothetical scaling of operations to the as is state 
for accreditation  the current as is scenario derives value from cash flows projected from fiscal to fiscal  with revenue compound annual growth rates ranging from to with discount rates ranging from to 
after the estimated future cash flows for the as is and without scenarios were determined  management calculated their respective present values and then subtracted the present value of the without scenario from the present value of the as is scenario to obtain the estimated fair value of accreditation 
the significant assumptions for the without scenario include revenue compound annual growth rates ranging from to with discount rates ranging from to 
using this analysis  at june  the fair value of accreditation exceeded book value by a range of to 
we used the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value of trade names 
under the relief from royalty method  estimated royalty rates were selected and applied to the revenue stream generated by trade names in order to estimate the potential value of the asset  assuming that trade names would be licensed to a third party 
for heald  we assume a royalty rate of based upon profit split analysis and comparable licensing transactions  a discount rate of  a tax rate of  and a terminal growth rate value of 
for wyotech  we assume a royalty rate of based upon profit split analysis and comparable licensing transactions  a discount rate of  a tax rate of and a terminal growth rate value of 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we considered if any indicators of impairment existed at the balance sheet date 
consequently  we performed an interim impairment test on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
we believe that continued regulatory uncertainties  and the potential impact of new regulations have had a sustained negative impact on our stock price and current fair 
table of contents value 
while the results of the interim impairment test did not indicate an impairment of goodwill  it did indicate that the fair value of certain intangible assets related to the wyotech schools were impaired 
the estimated fair values of wyotech trade names and accreditation fell below their carrying values of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the decline in market capitalization and the associated increase in the discount rate assumption compared to june  as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million  which reduced the carrying value of wyotech trade names to million and accreditation to million 
the impairment charge is reflected in the impairment  facility closing and severance charges caption on the related consolidated statements of operations 
amortization expense associated with intangibles was million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
curriculum is amortized over a range of five to fifteen years 
student relationships are amortized over eight years 
non compete agreements are amortized over the related non compete time period 
the total remaining weighted average amortization period for intangible assets subject to amortization is approximately years as of june  additionally  included in intangible amortization  we recognized non compete agreement expense totaling approximately million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred income tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of our deferred income tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred income tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets annually 
in addition  we review our income tax filing positions quarterly and update our tax contingency reserves as necessary 
see note income taxes 
assets and liabilities held for sale 
we estimate the fair value of certain assets and liabilities associated with schools that are held for sale 
the valuation of these assets and liabilities involves subjective judgment by management on the timing and amount of proceeds or payments 
these estimates had an effect on the amount of impairment losses recognized during we develop these assumptions based on past experience and by evaluating the circumstances surrounding each situation and location 
these estimates are subject to change and thus any variation to the estimates could influence the total loss on the sale of schools 
contingencies 
in the ordinary conduct of the business  we are subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims  including  but not limited to  claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the lawsuits  investigations or claims pending against us will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost for our equity instruments exchanged for employee and director services is measured at the date of grant  based on the calculated fair value of the grant and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the period of time that the grantee must provide services to us before the stock based compensation is fully vested 
the vesting period is generally the period set forth in the agreement granting the stock based compensation

historically  our colleges  schools and training centers have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new branch openings  new program adoptions and increased enrollments from recent high school graduates 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

historically  we had developed several third party loan programs with origination and servicing providers such as sallie mae for students with low credit scores who otherwise would not qualify for loans 
these loan programs required that we pay a discount fee to the origination and servicing providers of the loans as a reserve against future defaults on these loans 
we have historically referred to these types of loans as discount loans  since we incurred a portion of the default risk related to these student loans by taking a discount on the disbursement from the third party 
by accepting a reduced payment for these discounted loans from the servicing providers  we were not at risk for the amounts agreed to by the students and the service providers and we were not entitled to any proceeds collected by the service providers in excess of the reduced payment amount 
therefore we had recorded this discount as a reduction to revenue 
in fiscal  we were informed by sallie mae and two other origination and servicing providers that they would no longer make private loans available for students 
in the face of this change in policy  we created a new lending program in the fourth quarter of fiscal with a different origination and servicing provider  genesis lending services  inc genesis 
under this genesis program we paid a discount to the origination and servicing provider for any loans purchased by genesis and recorded the discount as a reduction to revenue 
under this program we then had both the right and an obligation to acquire the related loan  except in certain limited circumstances where genesis did not comply with the terms of the agreement 
from the initiation of the genesis program to its cessation in fiscal  we acquired all of the loans that originated 
therefore  we are exposed to any credit defaults by students but retains all amounts collected from the students under this program 
we estimate loans funded under the genesis discount loan program  net of refunds  were approximately million for fiscal there have been no loans funded under the genesis discount loan program during fiscal year 
table of contents on june   we entered into a loan origination agreement  as amended with asfg  llc asfg for the purpose of creating a new private education discount loan program for students 
under the loan origination agreement  asfg has agreed to purchase up to million of new student loans through june under this agreement  an unaffiliated bank makes private education loans to eligible students and  subsequently  sell those loans to asfg or its designee 
total losses associated with the program recourse  inclusive of the discount paid to asfg  are estimated to be approximately of the amount funded 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed the transition from the genesis discount loan program to the asfg discount loan program 
loans funded under the asfg program  net of estimated refunds  are estimated to have been approximately million and million for the fiscal years ending june  and  respectively 
loans funded to date under the asfg program  net of estimated refunds  have been approximately million 
the asfg loan program has characteristics similar to the previous third party discount loan programs 
as with the previous third party discount loan programs  under the asfg program we pay an upfront discount to asfg for any notes purchased by asfg 
we record the upfront discount as a deferred charge and amortize the charge as a reduction to revenue ratably over the program length as the related revenue is recognized 
however  unlike the previous third party discount loan programs  pursuant to a backup loan purchase agreement entered into in connection with the loan origination agreement  we have guaranteed to purchase any of the student notes from asfg on which no payment has been made for over days 
we have applied historical loan performance experience to estimate and record this loan recourse obligation on a gross basis by recording both a deferred charge and liability equal to the estimated risk upon funding 
the recourse obligation is in addition to the discount paid to asfg and is based upon the ultimate anticipated loan performance under the asfg loan program 
the deferred charge is recorded within prepaid expenses and is recognized as a reduction to revenue over the period of instruction 
the total deferred charge related to unrecognized discount expense is million and million as of june  and june   respectively 
the recourse liability is established at the inception of the guarantee 
upon recourse we will repurchase any loans at the amount advanced by asfg net of any discount paid to asfg  less any principal payments collected by asfg 
the purchase will be recorded as a decrease to cash  an increase to student notes receivable  and a reduction to the recourse obligation 
the net recourse obligation consists of a net short term liability and a net long term receivable 
the receivable  pursuant to a tuition loan program agreement  that will be paid to us as asfg receives student payments in excess of the initial principal balance  less discount paid 
the receivable and recourse obligation are reported as a net short term and net long term amount to reflect the legal right of offset 
the net short term recourse obligation related to the loans funded under the asfg program at june  and was a net liability of million  and million  respectively  net of recourse paid 
the net short term recourse obligation at june  and june  is recorded within accrued expenses within the consolidated balance sheets 
the net long term recourse receivable related to loans funded under the asfg program at june  and was a net asset of million and million  respectively 
the net long term recourse receivable is recorded within deposits and other assets within the consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate loan performance based upon actual repayment experience with similar private student loan programs 
under this backup loan purchase agreement  our maximum obligation including the initial discount payment could be equal to the face amount of loans originated under this loan program  although we expect the ultimate risk under this loan program to be substantially similar to the risks faced under the genesis discount loan program 
cash flows associated with loans funded under the asfg loan program  net of refunds  are recorded as a cash inflow from prepaid tuition within cash flows from operating activities in the amount of million  million and million for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 

table of contents cash flows associated with the asfg discount fee  net of refunds  are recorded as a cash outflow from prepaid expenses within cash flows from operating activities in the amount of million  million and million for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
recourse payments to asfg are recorded as a cash outflow from student notes receivable within cash flows from operating activities 
recourse payments to asfg have been million  million and million for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
net revenues recognized related to the asfg program  net of discount expense  have been million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively  cash flows have been a net inflow outflow of million  million and million for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  excludes proceeds from loan sales 
included within the consolidated statement of operations  under the caption other expense income  net  for fiscal years ended june   and is net other loss income of million  million and million  associated with the student notes program  respectively 
genesis program the other expense income  net primarily reflects the interest income  loan origination fees  and costs related to servicing loans 
we defer and recognize both the loan origination income and direct loan origination costs as an adjustment to the yield over the life of the related loan 
all other lending related costs  including costs related to servicing fees are charged to expense as incurred 
net other expense includes million million  million and million associated with the genesis notes program  for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
asfg program the other expense income  net primarily reflects the program structuring fees  management fees  and other fees charged by asfg 
we defer and recognize program structuring and management fees over the program length 
all other fees are charged to expense as incurred 
for fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  there was net other expense of million million  million and million associated with the asfg notes program 
total program structuring and management fees paid to asfg  over the life of the program as of june  have been million  of which million are deferred as of june  program fees paid to asfg during fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  are million  million and million 
total program fees expected to be incurred over the program length are expected to be to million per year in incremental cost above those historically incurred under the genesis program 
we believe that our working capital  cash flow from operations  access to operating leases and borrowings available from our amended credit agreement will provide us with adequate resources for our ongoing operations and planned capital expenditures through fiscal 
table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations as of june   future minimum cash payments due under contractual obligations  including our credit agreement  borrowings under student notes receivable sale agreement  and non cancelable operating and capital lease agreements  are as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt borrowings under student notes receivable sale agreement other debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total long term debt consists of a revolving credit facility

see note for additional information related to the company credit facility 
ed requires that title iv program funds collected in advance of student billings be kept in a separate cash or cash equivalent account until the students are billed for the program portion related to those funds 
in addition  all title iv program funds received by our schools through electronic funds transfer are subject to certain holding period restrictions 
these funds are also deposited into a separate account until the restrictions are satisfied 
as of june   we held nominal amounts of such funds in separate accounts 
the restrictions on any cash held have not significantly affected our ability to fund daily operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
we do not utilize interest rate swaps  forward or option contracts on foreign currencies or commodities  or other types of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
interest rate exposure 
as of june   our only assets or liabilities subject to risks from interest rate changes are i debt under the credit facility in the aggregate amount of million and capital lease obligations of million  and ii student notes receivable  net  in the aggregate amount of million 
our capital lease obligations and student notes receivable are all at fixed interest rates 
we do not believe we are subject to material risks from reasonably possible near term changes in market interest rates 
foreign currency exposure 
a portion of our operations consists of an investment in a foreign subsidiary whose functional currency is the canadian dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of june  was a deficit of approximately cad million and we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility of approximately cad million 
as a result  the consolidated financial results have been and could continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates
