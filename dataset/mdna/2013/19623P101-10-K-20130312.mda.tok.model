the company colony bankcorp  inc colony is a bank holding company headquartered in fitzgerald  georgia that provides  through its wholly owned subsidiary collectively referred to as the company  a broad array of products and services throughout central  south and coastal georgia markets 
the company offers commercial  consumer and mortgage banking services 
application of critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s financial position and or results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and they require management to make estimates that are difficult and subjective or complete 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses provides coverage for probable losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly based on changes  if any  in underwriting activities  the loan portfolio composition including product mix and geographic  industry or customer specific concentrations  trends in loan performance  regulatory guidance and economic factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires the use of significant management estimates 
many factors can affect management s estimates of specific and expected losses  including volatility of default probabilities  collateral values  rating migrations  loss severity and economic and political conditions 
the allowance is increased through provisions charged to operating earnings and reduced by net charge offs 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the company determines the amount of the allowance based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio 
the allowance recorded for loans is based on reviews of individual credit relationships and historical loss experience 
the allowance for losses relating to impaired loans is based on the loan s observable market price  the discounted cash flows using the loan s effective interest rate  or the value of collateral for collateral dependent loans 
regardless of the extent of the company s analysis of customer performance  portfolio trends or risk management processes  certain inherent but undetected losses are probable within the loan portfolio 
this is due to several factors  including inherent delays in obtaining information regarding a customer s financial condition or changes in their unique business conditions  the judgmental nature of individual loan evaluations  collateral assessments and the interpretation of economic trends 
volatility of economic or customer specific conditions affecting the identification and estimation of losses for larger nonhomogeneous credits and the sensitivity of assumptions utilized to establish allowances for homogeneous groups of loans are among other factors 
the company estimates a range of inherent losses related to the existence of these exposures 
the estimates are based upon the company s evaluation of risk associated with the commercial and consumer levels and the estimated impact of the current economic environment 
other real estate owned and foreclosed assets other real estate owned or other foreclosed assets acquired through loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value less costs to sell when acquired  establishing a new cost basis 
the adjustment at the time of foreclosure is recorded through the allowance for loan losses 
due to the subjective nature of establishing the fair value when the asset is acquired  the actual fair value of the other real estate owned or foreclosed asset could differ from the original estimate 
if it is determined that fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure  the valuation allowance is adjusted through a charge to noninterest expense 
operating costs associated with the assets after acquisition are also recorded as noninterest expense 
gains and losses on the disposition of other real estate owned and foreclosed assets are netted and recognized in noninterest expense 
management obtains appraisals performed by certified  third parties within one year of placing a property into oreo 
the fair value of the property is then evaluated by management annually going forward  or more often if necessary 
annual evaluations may be performed by certified third parties  or internally by management comparing recent sales of similar properties within the company s oreo portfolio 
overview the following discussion and analysis presents the more significant factors affecting the company s financial condition as of december  and  and results of operations for each of the years in the three year period ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements  notes thereto and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
taxable equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from tax free loans and investments by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a percent federal tax rate  thus making tax exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields 
dollar amounts in tables are stated in thousands  except for per share amounts 

table of contents part ii continued item continued results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company determine interest rates  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets 
net income loss available to common shareholders totaled million  or per diluted common share in compared to million  or per diluted common share in compared to million  or diluted per common share in selected income statement data  returns on average assets and average equity and dividends per share for the comparable periods were as follows taxable equivalent net interest income taxable equivalent adjustment net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes benefits net income preferred stock dividends net income loss available to common stockholders basic per common share net income loss diluted per common share net income loss return on average assets net income loss return on average equity net income loss 
table of contents part ii continued item continued net income available to common shareholders for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million decrease in provision for loan losses and an increase of million in net interest income 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a thousand decrease in noninterest income  an increase of million in noninterest expense and an increase of thousand in income tax expense 
net income available to common shareholders for increased million  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily the result of a million decrease in provision for loan losses and a decrease of thousand in noninterest expense 
the impact of these items was partly offset by a million decrease in net interest income  a decrease of thousand in noninterest income and an increase of million in income tax expense 
details of the changes in the various components of net income are further discussed below 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and securities  and interest expense on liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue  representing percent of total revenue during and percent during net interest margin is the taxable equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
the level of interest rates and the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities impact net interest income and net interest margin 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
the company s loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit is currently percent and has been for the past four years 
the federal funds rate moved similar to prime rate with interest rates currently at percent and has been for the past four years 
we anticipate the federal reserve maintaining its current interest rate policy in  which should benefit colony s net interest margin 
the following table presents the changes in taxable equivalent net interest income and identifies the changes due to differences in the average volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the changes due to changes in the average interest rate on those assets and liabilities 
the changes in net interest income due to changes in both average volume and average interest rate have been allocated to the average volume change or the average interest rate change in proportion to the absolute amounts of the change in each 
the company s consolidated average balance sheets along with an analysis of taxable equivalent net interest earnings are presented in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this report 

table of contents part ii continued item continued rate volume analysis the rate volume analysis presented hereafter illustrates the change from year to year for each component of the taxable equivalent net interest income separated into the amount generated through volume changes and the amount generated by changes in the yields rates 
changes from changes from to a to a volume rate total volume rate total interest income loans  net taxable investment securities taxable tax exempt total investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks federal funds sold other interest earning assets total interest income interest expense interest bearing demand and savings deposits time deposits total interest expense on deposits other interest bearing liabilities federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements subordinated debentures other debt total interest expense net interest income loss a changes in net interest income for the periods  based on either changes in average balances or changes in average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  are shown on this table 
during each year there are numerous and simultaneous balance and rate changes  therefore  it is not possible to precisely allocate the changes between balances and rates 
for the purpose of this table  changes that are not exclusively due to balance changes or rate changes have been attributed to rates 
our financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we do not utilize derivatives to mitigate our credit risk  relying instead on an extensive loan review process and our allowance for loan losses 

table of contents part ii continued item continued interest rate risk is the change in value due to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed only to us dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  the company manages exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
the company does not have any trading instruments nor does it classify any portion of its investment portfolio as held for trading 
the company does not engage in any hedging activity or utilize any derivatives 
the company has no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
interest rate risk is addressed by our asset liability management committee alco which includes senior management representatives 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact to the net portfolio of equity value and net interest income from potential changes to interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of financial institutions 
the repricing of interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is gap management and our company has established its policy to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
our exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed at least quarterly by our board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine our change in net portfolio value in the event of assumed changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations  we have implemented strategies to more closely match our balance sheet composition 
the company has engaged ftn financial to run a quarterly asset liability model for interest rate risk analysis 
we are generally focusing our investment activities on securities with terms or average lives in the year range 
the company maintains about percent of its loan portfolio in adjustable rate loans that reprice with prime rate changes  while the bulk of its other loans mature within years 
the liabilities to fund assets are primarily in short term certificates of deposit that mature within one year 
this balance sheet composition allowed the company to be relatively constant with its net interest margin until during  interest rates decreased basis points and this decrease by the federal reserve in followed by basis point decrease in resulted in significant pressure in net interest margins 
while the federal reserve rates have remained unchanged since  we have seen the net interest margin increase to percent for compared to percent for and to percent for given the federal reserve s aggressive posture during that ended the year with a range of percent federal funds target rate and remained the same for all of  we have seen our net interest margin reach a low of percent for first quarter to a high of percent for third quarter 
table of contents part ii continued item continued taxable equivalent net interest income for increased by million  or percent  compared to while taxable equivalent net interest income for decreased by million  or percent  compared to the average volume of earning assets during decreased million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin increased to from percent 
improvement in the net interest margin in was primarily driven by reduction in the cost of funds and maintaining longer term investments 
similarly  the average volume of earning assets during decreased million compared to while over the same period the net interest margin decreased to from percent 
the decline in average earning assets in affected each category of assets  while the significant decrease was primarily in average loans and investment securities 
growth in average earning assets during and was primarily in fed funds sold and investment securities  while average loans outstanding decreased significantly 
the slight reduction in the net interest margin in was primarily the result of the decrease in average earning assets and maintenance of a higher liquidity level 
the average volume of loans decreased million in compared to and decreased million in compared to the average yield on loans decreased basis point in compared to and decreased basis points in compared to the average volume of deposits decreased million while other borrowings decreased million in compared to the average volume of other borrowings decreased million in compared to while average deposits decreased million in compared to interest bearing deposits made up percent of the decrease in average deposits in and percent of the decrease in average deposits in accordingly  the ratio of average interest bearing deposits to total average deposits was percent in  percent in and percent in this deposit mix  combined with a general decrease in interest rates  had the effect of i decreasing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to and decreasing the average cost of total deposits by basis points in compared to  and ii mitigating a portion of the impact of decreasing yields on earning assets on the company s net interest income 
the company s net interest spread  which represents the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was percent in compared to percent in and percent in the net interest spread  as well as the net interest margin  will be impacted by future changes in short term and long term interest rate levels  as well as the impact from the competitive environment 
a discussion of the effects of changing interest rates on net interest income is set forth in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about interest rate sensitivity included elsewhere in this report 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for loan losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level which  in management s best estimate  is necessary to absorb probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in see the section captioned allowance for loan losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for loan losses 

table of contents part ii continued item continued noninterest income the components of noninterest income were as follows service charges on deposit accounts other charges  commissions and fees other mortgage fee income securities gains sba premiums total noninterest income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to while total noninterest income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease in noninterest income compared to was primarily in sba premiums while the decrease in noninterest income compared to was primarily in mortgage fee income  sba premiums  and service charges on deposit accounts 
changes in these items and the other components of noninterest income are discussed in more detail below 
service charges on deposit accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts for increased thousand  or percent  compared to service charges on deposit accounts for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase in was primarily due to an increase in volume of consumer and business account overdraft fees 
mortgage fee income 
mortgage fee income for increased thousand  or percent  compared to while mortgage fee income for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase in was due to increased mortgage loan activity due to an initiative to increase mortgage lending opportunities given the low interest rate environment 
the decrease in was primarily due to decreased mortgage loan activity with the housing and real estate downturn 
security gains 
the company realized gains from the sale of securities of million for compared to million for and million in all other noninterest income 
other charges  commissions and fees  other income and sba premiums for decreased thousand  or percent  compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the decline in sba premiums 
in other charges  commissions and fees  other income and sba premiums for increased thousand  or percent  compared to the increase was primarily attributable to increased atm and bank debit card interchange fees for compared to 
table of contents part ii continued item continued noninterest expense the components of noninterest expense were as follows salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment other total noninterest expense for increased million  or percent compared to while total noninterest expense decreased thousand  or percent compared to growth in noninterest expense in was primarily in salaries and employee benefits and noninterest expense while the company had a slight decrease in occupancy and equipment 
reduction in noninterest expense in was primarily in occupancy and equipment and other noninterest expense while the company had a slight increase in salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefits expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in headcount related to increased regulatory compliance demands 
salaries and employee benefits expense for increased thousand  or percent  compared to occupancy and equipment 
net occupancy expense for decreased thousand compared to  or a decrease of percent 
net occupancy expense for decreased thousand compared to  or a decrease of percent 
the decrease in occupancy expense in is primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense of thousand from all other noninterest expense 
all other noninterest expense for increased million  or percent 
significant changes in noninterest expense were fdic insurance assessment fees decreased to million for compared to million for  or a decrease of thousand  legal and professional fees decreased to million for in comparison to million for  or a decrease of thousand  foreclosed property and repossession expense increased to million in compared to million in  or an increase of million  and advertising decreased to thousand in compared to thousand in  or a decrease of thousand

over the comparable periods  the relative mix of deposits continues to be high in interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits totaled percent of total average deposits in compared to percent in and percent in the company primarily invests funds in loans and securities 
loans continue to be the largest component of the company s mix of invested assets 
loan demand increased in as total loans were million at december   up percent  compared to loans of million at december   while total loans at december  were down percent  compared to loans of million at december  see additional discussion regarding the company s loan portfolio in the section captioned loans included below 
the majority of funds provided by deposits have been invested in loans 

table of contents part ii continued item continued loans the following table presents the composition of the company s loan portfolio as of december for the past five years 
commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction mortgage  farmland mortgage  other consumer other unearned interest and fees allowance for loan losses loans the following table presents total loans as of december  according to maturity distribution and or repricing opportunity on adjustable rate loans 
maturity and repricing opportunity one year or less after one year through three years after three years through five years over five years overview 
loans totaled million at december   up percent from december  loans of million 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio is comprised of the real estate loans mortgage other  real estate construction and commercial financial and agricultural loans 
real estate other  which is primarily family residential properties and nonfarm nonresidential properties  made up percent and percent of total loans  real estate construction made up percent and percent while commercial financial and agricultural loans made up percent and percent of total loans at december  and december   respectively 
real estate loans mortgage other include both commercial and consumer balances 
loan origination risk management 
in accordance with the company s decentralized banking model  loan decisions are made at the local bank level 
the company utilizes an executive loan committee to assist lenders with the decision making and underwriting process of larger loan requests 
due to the diverse economic markets served by the company  evaluation and underwriting criterion may vary slightly by market 
overall  loans are extended after a review of the borrower s repayment ability  collateral adequacy  and overall credit worthiness 

table of contents part ii continued item continued commercial purpose  commercial real estate  and industrial loans are underwritten similar to other loans throughout the company 
the properties securing the company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location 
this diversity helps reduce the company s exposure to adverse economic events that affect any single market or industry 
management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral  geography  and risk grade criteria 
the company also utilizes information provided by third party agencies to provide additional insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting the markets it serves 
the company extends loans to builders and developers that are secured by non owner occupied properties 
in such cases  the company reviews the overall economic conditions and trends for each market to determine the desirability of loans to be extended for residential construction and development 
sources of repayment for these types of loans may be pre committed permanent loans from approved long term lenders  sales of developed property or an interim mini perm loan commitment from the company until permanent financing is obtained 
in some cases  loans are extended for residential loan construction for speculative purposes and are based on the perceived present and future demand for housing in a particular market served by the company 
these loans are monitored by on site inspections and are considered to have higher risks than other real estate loans due to their ultimate repayment being sensitive to interest rate changes  general economic conditions and trends  the demand for the properties  and the availability of long term financing 
the company originates consumer loans at the bank level 
due to the diverse economic markets served by the company  underwriting criterion may vary slightly by market 
the company is committed to serving the borrowing needs of all markets served and  in some cases  adjusts certain evaluation methods to meet the overall credit demographics of each market 
consumer loans represent relatively small loan amounts that are spread across many individual borrowers to help minimize risk 
additionally  consumer trends and outlook reports are reviewed by management on a regular basis 
the company utilizes an independent third party company for loan review and validation of the credit risk program on an ongoing quarterly basis 
results of these reviews are presented to management and the audit committee 
the loan review process complements and reinforces the risk identification and assessment decisions made by lenders and credit personnel  as well as the company s policies and procedures 
commercial  financial and agricultural 
commercial  financial and agricultural loans at december  increased percent from december  to million 
the company s commercial and industrial loans are a diverse group of loans to small  medium and large businesses 
the purpose of these loans varies from supporting seasonal working capital needs to term financing of equipment 
while some short term loans may be made on an unsecured basis  most are secured by the assets being financed with collateral margins that are consistent with the company s loan policy guidelines 
industry concentrations 
as of december  and december   there were no concentrations of loans within any single industry in excess of percent of total loans  as segregated by standard industrial classification code sic code 
the sic code is a federally designed standard industrial numbering system used by the company to categorize loans by the borrower s type of business 

table of contents part ii continued item continued collateral concentrations 
concentrations of credit risk can exist in relation to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers  certain types of collateral  certain types of industries  or certain geographic regions 
the company has a concentration in real estate loans as well as a geographic concentration that could pose an adverse credit risk  particularly with the current economic downturn in the real estate market 
at december   approximately percent of the company s loan portfolio was concentrated in loans secured by real estate 
a substantial portion of borrowers ability to honor their contractual obligations is dependent upon the viability of the real estate economic sector 
the downturn of the housing and real estate market that began in resulted in an increase of problem loans secured by real estate 
these loans are centered primarily in the company s larger msa markets 
declining collateral real estate values that secure land development  construction and speculative real estate loans in the company s larger msa markets have resulted in high loan loss provisions in the last several years 
in addition  a large portion of the company s foreclosed assets are also located in these same geographic markets  making the recovery of the carrying amount of foreclosed assets susceptible to changes in market conditions 
management continues to monitor these concentrations and has considered these concentrations in its allowance for loan loss analysis 
large credit relationships 
the company is currently in eighteen counties in central  south and coastal georgia and includes metropolitan markets in dougherty  lowndes  houston  chatham and muscogee counties 
as a result  the company originates and maintains large credit relationships with several commercial customers in the ordinary course of business 
the company considers large credit relationships to be those with commitments equal to or in excess of million prior to any portion being sold 
large relationships also include loan participations purchased if the credit relationship with the agent is equal to or in excess of million 
in addition to the company s normal policies and procedures related to the origination of large credits  the company s executive loan committee and director loan committee must approve all new and renewed credit facilities which are part of large credit relationships 
the following table provides additional information on the company s large credit relationships outstanding at december  and december  december  december  number of period end balances number of period end balances relationships committed outstanding relationships committed outstanding large credit relationships million and greater million to million maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the maturity distribution of the company s loans at december  the table also presents the portion of loans that have fixed interest rates or variable interest rates that fluctuate over the life of the loans in accordance with changes in an interest rate index such as the prime rate 
due in one year or less after one  but within three years after three  but within five years after five years total loans with fixed interest rates loans with floating interest rates total 
table of contents part ii continued item continued the company may renew loans at maturity when requested by a customer whose financial strength appears to support such renewal or when such renewal appears to be in the company s best interest 
in such instances  the company generally requires payment of accrued interest and may adjust the rate of interest  require a principal reduction or modify other terms of the loan at the time of renewal 
nonperforming assets and potential problem loans year end nonperforming assets and accruing past due loans were as follows loans accounted for on nonaccrual loans past due days or more other real estate foreclosed securities accounted for on nonaccrual total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets total assets supplemental data trouble debt restructured loans in compliance with modified terms trouble debt restructured loans past due days accruing past due loans days past due or more days past due total accruing past due loans nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans  loans past due days or more  foreclosed real estate and nonaccrual securities 
nonperforming assets at december  decreased percent from december  generally  loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become days past due and or management deems the collectibility of the principal and or interest to be in question  as well as when required by regulatory requirements 
loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is days or more past due 
for consumer loans  collectibility and loss are generally determined before the loan reaches days past due 
accordingly  losses on consumer loans are recorded at the time they are determined 
consumer loans that are days or more past due are generally either in liquidation payment status or bankruptcy awaiting confirmation of a plan 
once interest accruals are discontinued  accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations 
subsequent receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal  and interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured 
classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest 

table of contents part ii continued item continued troubled debt restructured loans are loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven 
foreclosed assets represent property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed assets are recorded at estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
write downs occurring at foreclosure are charged against the allowance for possible loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
write downs are provided for subsequent declines in value and are included in other non interest expense along with other expenses related to maintaining the properties 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense  which represents management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with current us accounting standards 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
portions of the allowance may be allocated for specific credits  however  the entire allowance is available for any credit that  in management s judgment  should be charged off 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of the company s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
the company s allowance for loan losses consists of specific valuation allowances established for probable losses on specific loans and historical valuation allowances  adjusted for qualitative factors  for other loans with similar risk characteristics 
the allowances established for probable losses on specific loans are based on a regular analysis and evaluation of classified loans 
loans are classified based on an internal credit risk grading process that evaluates  among other things i the obligor s ability to repay  ii the underlying collateral  if any  and iii the economic environment and industry in which the borrower operates 
this analysis is performed at the subsidiary bank level and is reviewed at the parent company level 
once a loan is classified  it is reviewed to determine whether the loan is impaired and  if impaired  a portion of the allowance for possible loan losses is specifically allocated to the loan 
specific valuation allowances are determined after considering the borrower s financial condition  collateral deficiencies  and economic conditions affecting the borrower s industry  among other things 

table of contents part ii continued item continued historical valuation allowances are calculated from loss factors applied to loans with similar risk characteristics 
the loss factors are based on loss ratios for groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
the loss ratios are derived from the proportional relationship between actual loan losses and the total population of loans in the risk category 
the historical loss ratios are periodically updated based on actual charge off experience 
the company s groups of similar loans include similarly risk graded groups of loans not reviewed for individual impairment 
in addition  the company has also segmented its real estate portfolio into thirteen separate categories and captured loan loss experience for each category 
most of the company s charge offs the past two years have been real estate dependent loans and we believe this segmentation provides more accuracy in determining allowance for loan loss adequacy 
during first quarter  management refined the company s methodology used in estimating the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll which is defined in the notes to the financial statements 
the effect of these changes on the alll resulted in a reduction in the alll estimate of  management believes the adjustments made will result in a better estimation of losses incurred in the portfolio 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for each of these components on a quarterly basis 
peer comparisons  industry comparisons  and regulatory guidelines are also used in the determination of the general valuation allowance 
loans identified as losses by management  internal loan review  and or bank examiners are charged off 
an allocation for loan losses has been made according to the respective amounts deemed necessary to provide for the possibility of incurred losses within the various loan categories 
the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for changes in experience among each category 
additional amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is subjective since it is based on judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which the charge offs may ultimately occur 
the following table shows a comparison of the allocation of the reserve for loan losses for the periods indicated 
reserve reserve reserve reserve reserve commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate farmland real estate other loans to individuals all other loans total loan balance in each category expressed as a percentage of total end of period loans 
activity in the allowance for loan losses is presented in the following table 
there were no charge offs or recoveries related to foreign loans during any of the periods presented 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the following table presents an analysis of the company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated 
allowance for loan losses at beginning of year charge offs commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer all other recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate consumer all other net charge offs provision for loans losses allowance for loan losses at end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate by management  based on estimated probable losses within the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for loan losses reflects loan quality trends  including the level of net charge offs or recoveries  among other factors 
the provision for loan losses decreased million from million in to million in the provision for loan losses charged to earnings was based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at an adequate level to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
the amount each period is dependent upon many factors  including changes in the risk ratings of the loan portfolio  net charge offs  past due ratios  the value of collateral  and other environmental factors that include portfolio loan quality indicators  portfolio growth and composition of commercial real estate and concentrations  portfolio policies  procedures  underwriting standards  loss recognition  collection and recovery practices  local economic business conditions  and the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff 
of significance to changes in the allowance during was the reduction in the net charge offs in to million from million in the company believes that collection efforts have reduced impaired loans and the reduction in net charge offs runs parallel with the improvement in the substandard assets 
as we begin to see stabilization in the economy and the housing and real estate market  we expect continued improvement in our substandard assets  including net charge offs 

table of contents part ii continued item continued provisions continue to be higher than normal primarily due to the elevated risk of residential real estate and land development loans that began during with the housing and real estate downturn 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed assets decreased to percent at december  compared to percent at december  total nonperforming assets at december  were million  of which million were construction  land development and other land loans  million were farmland properties  million were family residential properties  million were multifamily properties  million were nonfarm nonresidential properties  and the remainder of nonperforming assets totaling million were commercial and consumer loans 
total nonperforming assets at december  were million  of which million were construction  land development and other land loans  million were family residential properties  million were multifamily properties  million were nonfarm nonresidential properties  million were farmland properties  and the remainder of nonperforming assets totaling million were commercial and consumer loans 
all of the classified loans greater than thousand  including the nonperforming loans  are reviewed each quarter for impairment 
the allowance for loan losses of million at december  was percent of total loans which compares to million at december   or percent of total loans and to million at december   or percent 
unusually high levels of loan loss provision have been required over the past few years as company management addresses asset quality deterioration 
while the nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans was percent  percent  and percent  respectively as of december   december  and december   the company s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was percent  percent  and percent  respectively as of december   december  and december  we continue to identify new problem loans  though at a slower pace than the previous year 
while the allowance for loan losses decreased from million  or percent of total loans at december  to million  or percent of total loans at december   the company also reflected a decrease in nonperforming loans from million at december  to million at december  when a loan is performing  it is accounted for under the company s general loan loss reserve methodology 
once the loan becomes impaired  it is removed from the pool of loans covered by the general reserve and reviewed individually for exposure 
in cases where the individual review reveals no exposure  no reserve is recorded for that loan 
if  however  the individual review of the loan does indicate some exposure  management often charges off this exposure  rather than recording a specific reserve 
in these instances  a loan which becomes nonperforming could actually reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is inherently judgmental  nevertheless the company s methodology is consistently applied based on standards for current accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and allowance allocations determined in accordance with accounting for contingencies 
loans individually selected for impairment review consist of all loans classified substandard that are thousand and over 
the remaining portfolio is analyzed based on historical loss data 
loans selected for individual review where no individual impairment amount is identified do not receive a contribution to the allowance for loan losses based on historical data 
historical loss rates are updated annually to provide the annual loss rate which is applied to the appropriate portfolio grades 
in addition  the company has also segmented its real estate portfolio into thirteen separate categories and captured loan loss experience for each category 
most of the company s charge offs during the past four years have been real estate dependent loans and we believe this segmentation provides more accuracy in determining allowance for loan loss adequacy 

table of contents part ii continued item continued in addition  environmental factors as discussed earlier are evaluated for any adjustments needed to the allowance for loan losses determination produced by individual loan impairment analysis and remaining portfolio segmentation analysis 
the allowance for loan losses determination is based on individual loan reviews throughout the year and an environmental analysis at quarter end 
as part of our monitoring and evaluation of collateral values for nonperforming and problem loans in determining adequate allowance for loan losses  regional credit officers along with lending officers submit monthly problem loan reports for loans greater than thousand in which impairment is identified 
this process typically determines collateral shortfall based upon local market real estate value estimates should the collateral be liquidated 
once the loan is deemed uncollectible  it is transferred to our problem loan department for workout  foreclosure and or liquidation 
the problem loan department gets a current appraisal on the property in order to record a fair market value less selling expenses when the property is foreclosed on and moved into other real estate 
trends the past several quarters reflect a decrease in collateral values from two to three years ago on improved properties of fifteen to twenty five percent and on land development and land loans of thirty to fifty percent 
the significant reduction in collateral values on nonperforming assets has resulted in charge offs particularly during the allowance for loan losses is million less than the prior year end  after factoring in net charge offs  additional provisions  and the normal determination for an adequate funding level 
restructuring of some substandard and non performing loans during has resulted in significant charge offs  but a strategy deemed prudent in bringing resolution with these credits and a return to performing status in the future 
management believes the level of the allowance for loan losses was adequate as of december  should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for loan losses

table of contents part ii continued item continued off balance sheet arrangements  commitments  guarantees  and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and other commitments to make future payments as of december  payments for borrowings do not include interest 
payments related to leases are based on actual payments specified in the underlying contracts 
loan commitments and standby letters of credit are presented at contractual amounts  however  since many of these commitments are expected to expire unused or only partially used  the total amounts of these commitments do not necessarily reflect future cash requirements 
payments due by period year or less more than year but less than years years or more but less than years years or more total contractual obligations subordinated debentures federal home loan bank advances operating leases deposits with stated maturity dates other commitments loan commitments standby letters of credit total contractual obligations and other commitments in the ordinary course of business  the company has entered into off balance sheet financial instruments which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  performance letters of credit  guarantees and liability for assets held in trust 

table of contents part ii continued item continued such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the instruments become payable 
the company uses the same credit policies for these off balance sheet financial instruments as they do for instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments 
the company enters into contractual commitments to extend credit  normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses  at specified rates and for specific purposes 
substantially all of the company s commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards at the time of loan funding 
the company minimizes its exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures 
management assesses the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit in determining the level of the allowance for possible loan losses 
loan commitments outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 
standby letters of credit 
letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
in the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party  the company would be required to fund the commitment 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment 
if the commitment is funded  the company would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer 
the company s policies generally require that standby letters of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements 
standby letters of credit outstanding at december  are included in the preceding table 
capital and liquidity at december   shareholders equity totaled million compared to million at december  in addition to net income of million  other significant changes in shareholders equity during included million of dividends declared on preferred stock 
the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity totaled thousand at december  compared to million at december  this fluctuation was mostly related to the after tax effect of changes in the fair value of securities available for sale 
under regulatory requirements  the unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale does not increase or reduce regulatory capital and is not included in the calculation of risk based capital and leverage ratios 
regulatory agencies for banks and bank holding companies utilize capital guidelines designed to measure tier and total capital and take into consideration the risk inherent in both on balance sheet and off balance sheet items 
tier capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill and disallowed deferred tax assets 
tier capital consists of certain convertible  subordinated and other qualifying debt and the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
the company has no tier capital other than the allowance for loan losses 
using the capital requirements presently in effect  the tier ratio as of december  was percent and total tier and risk based capital was percent 
both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of percent for tier and percent for total risk based capital 
the company s tier leverage ratio as of december  was percent  which exceeds the required ratio standard of percent 
for  average capital was million  representing percent of average assets for the year 
this compares to percent for

the company deferred all dividend payments declared in on its preferred stock  as well as all interest payments on its trups in order to preserve cash at the holding company level 
the company had no preferred stock until january when shares were issued to us treasury 
the company  primarily through the actions of its subsidiary bank  engages in liquidity management to ensure adequate cash flow for deposit withdrawals  credit commitments and repayments of borrowed funds 
needs are met through loan repayments  net interest and fee income and the sale or maturity of existing assets 
in addition  liquidity is continuously provided through the acquisition of new deposits  the renewal of maturing deposits and external borrowings 
management monitors deposit flow and evaluates alternate pricing structures to retain and grow deposits 
to the extent needed to fund loan demand  traditional local deposit funding sources are supplemented by the use of fhlb borrowings  brokered deposits and other wholesale deposit sources outside the immediate market area 
internal policies have been updated to monitor the use of various core and non core funding sources  and to balance ready access with risk and cost 
through various asset liability management strategies  a balance is maintained among goals of liquidity  safety and earnings potential 
internal policies that are consistent with regulatory liquidity guidelines are monitored and enforced by the bank 
the investment portfolio provides a ready means to raise cash if liquidity needs arise 
as of december   the available for sale bond portfolio totaled million 
at december   the company held million in bonds excluding fhlb stock  at current market value in the available for sale portfolio 
only marketable investment grade bonds are purchased 
although most of the banks bond portfolios are encumbered as pledges to secure various public funds deposits  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes  management can restructure and free up investment securities for a sale if required to meet liquidity needs 
management continually monitors the relationship of loans to deposits as it primarily determines the company s liquidity posture 
colony had ratios of loans to deposits of percent as of december  and percent at december  management employs alternative funding sources when deposit balances will not meet loan demands 
the ratios of loans to all funding sources excluding subordinated debentures at december  and december  were percent and percent  respectively 
management continues to emphasize programs to generate local core deposits as our company s primary funding sources 
the stability of the banks core deposit base is an important factor in colony s liquidity position 
a heavy percentage of the deposit base is comprised of accounts of individuals and small businesses with comprehensive banking relationships and limited volatility 
at december  and december   the bank had million and million  respectively  in certificates of deposit of  or more 
these larger deposits represented percent and percent of respective total deposits 
management seeks to monitor and control the use of these larger certificates  which tend to be more volatile in nature  to ensure an adequate supply of funds as needed 
relative interest costs to attract local core relationships are compared to market rates of interest on various external deposit sources to help minimize the company s overall cost of funds 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the company supplemented deposit sources with brokered deposits 
as of december   the company had million  or percent of total deposits  in brokered certificates of deposit attracted by external third parties 
additionally  the bank uses external wholesale or internet services to obtain out of market certificates of deposit at competitive interest rates when funding is needed 
as of december   the company had million  or percent of total deposits  in external wholesale or internet network deposits 
to plan for contingent sources of funding not satisfied by both local and out of market deposit balances  colony and its subsidiary have established multiple borrowing sources to augment their funds management 
the company has borrowing capacity through membership of the federal home loan bank program 
the bank has also established overnight borrowing for federal funds purchased through various correspondent banks 
management believes the various funding sources discussed above are adequate to meet the company s liquidity needs in the future without any material adverse impact on operating results 
liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of balance sheet structure  the ability to liquidate assets  and the availability of alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management 
asset liquidity is provided by liquid assets which are readily marketable or pledgeable or which will mature in the near future 
liquid assets include cash  interest bearing deposits in banks  securities available for sale  maturities and cash flow from securities held to maturity  and federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
liability liquidity is provided by access to funding sources which include core deposits 
should the need arise  the company also maintains relationships with the federal home loan bank  federal reserve bank  two correspondent banks and repurchase agreement lines that can provide funds on short notice 
since colony is a bank holding company and does not conduct operations  its primary sources of liquidity are dividends up streamed from the subsidiary bank and borrowings from outside sources 
the liquidity position of the company is continuously monitored and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate 
management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity  which if implemented  would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents part ii continued item continued impact of inflation and changing prices the company s financial statements included herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap presently requires the company to measure financial position and operating results primarily in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the inflation rate 
while interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company  including changes in the expected rate of inflation  the influence of general and local economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things  as further discussed in the next section 
regulatory and economic policies the company s business and earnings are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government  its agencies and various other governmental regulatory authorities  among other things 
the federal reserve board regulates the supply of money in order to influence general economic conditions 
among the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve board are i conducting open market operations in united states government obligations  ii changing the discount rate on financial institution borrowings  iii imposing or changing reserve requirements against financial institution deposits  and iv restricting certain borrowings and imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowing by financial institutions and their affiliates 
these methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to affect directly the availability of bank loans and deposits  as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
for that reason alone  the policies of the federal reserve board have a material effect on the earnings of the company 
governmental policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future  however  the company cannot accurately predict the nature  timing or extent of any effect such policies may have on its future business and earnings

table of contents part ii continued item continued colony bankcorp  inc and subsidiaries interest rate sensitivity the following table is an analysis of the company s interest rate sensitivity position at december  the interest bearing rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by repricing period  is based upon maturity or first repricing opportunity  along with a cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap 
it is important to note that the table indicates a position at a specific point in time and may not be reflective of positions at other times during the year or in subsequent periods 
major changes in the gap position can be  and are  made promptly as market outlooks change 
assets and liabilities repricing within months to to over or less months year years years total earning assets interest bearing deposits federal funds sold investment securities loans  net of unearned income other interest earning assets total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits savings time deposits other borrowings subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of interest earning assets cumulative interest rate sensitivity as a percentage of interest earning assets interest bearing demand and savings accounts for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 
short term borrowings for repricing purposes are considered to reprice within months or less 

table of contents part ii continued item continued the foregoing table indicates that we had a one year negative gap of million  or percent of total interest earning assets at december  in theory  this would indicate that at december   million more in liabilities than assets would reprice if there were a change in interest rates over the next days 
thus  if interest rates were to decline  the gap would indicate a resulting increase in net interest margin 
however  changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and our supporting liability can vary significantly while the timing of repricing of both the assets and our supporting liability can remain the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as a basis risk and  generally  relates to the repricing characteristics of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposits 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
measuring the volume of repricing or maturing assets and liabilities does not always measure the full impact on the portfolio value of equity or net interest income 
gap analysis does not account for rate caps on products  dynamic changes such as increasing prepay speeds as interest rates decrease  basis risk  or the benefit of non rate funding sources 
the majority of our loan portfolio reprices quickly and completely following changes in market rates  while non term deposit rates in general move slowly and usually incorporate only a fraction of the change in rates 
products categorized as nonrate sensitive  such as our noninterest bearing demand deposits  in the gap analysis behave like long term fixed rate funding sources 
both of these factors tend to make our actual behavior more asset sensitive than is indicated in the gap analysis 
in fact  we experience higher net interest income when rates rise  opposite what is indicated by the gap analysis 
therefore  management uses gap analysis  net interest margin analysis and market value of portfolio equity as our primary interest rate risk management tools 
the company utilizes ftn financial asset liability management analysis for a more dynamic analysis of balance sheet structure 
the company has established earnings at risk for net interest income in a basis point rate shock to be no more than a fifteen percent percentage change 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates that net interest income would deteriorate percent with a basis point decrease and would improve percent with a basis point increase 
though slightly outside policy  the increased exposure to declining rates is mitigated by the low likelihood of a further decline of basis points from the current rate levels 
the company has established equity at risk in a basis point rate shock to be no more than a twenty percent percentage change 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates that net economic value of equity percentage change would decrease percent with a basis point increase and would decrease percent with a basis point decrease 
the company has established its one year gap to be percent to percent 
the most recent analysis as of december  indicates a one year gap of percent 
the analysis reflects net interest margin compression in a declining interest rate environment 
given that interest rates have basically bottomed out with the recent federal reserve action  the company is anticipating interest rates to increase in the future though we believe that interest rates will remain flat most of the company is focusing on areas to minimize margin compression in the future by minimizing longer term fixed rate loans  shortening on the yield curve with investments  securing longer term fhlb advances  securing certificates of deposit for longer terms and focusing on reduction of nonperforming assets
