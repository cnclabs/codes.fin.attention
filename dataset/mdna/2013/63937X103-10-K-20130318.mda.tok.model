the company navidea biopharmaceuticals  inc navidea  the company  or we  a delaware corporation  is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of precision diagnostics and radiopharmaceutical agents 
we have one approved product in the us  lymphoseek technetium tc m tilmanocept injection  a novel  receptor targeted  small molecule radiopharmaceutical  indicated for use in lymphatic mapping for breast cancer and melanoma 
lymphoseek is designed to identify the lymph nodes that drain from a primary tumor  which have the highest probability of harboring cancer 
additional investigational trials in other solid tumor cancers are anticipated to provide support for expanding the utilization of lymphoseek into multiple other cancer types 
we are currently developing three other radiopharmaceutical agent platforms 
nav  is an f radiolabeled positron emission tomography pet imaging agent being developed as an aid in the diagnosis of patients with signs or symptoms of cognitive impairment such as alzheimer s disease ad 
nav  is an iodine radiolabeled single photon emission computed tomography spect imaging agent being developed as an aid in the diagnosis of parkinson s disease pd and other movement disorders  with potential additional use as a diagnostic aid in dementia 
rigscan tm  is a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody being developed as a diagnostic aid for use during surgery to help surgeons locate occult or metastatic cancer  with a primary focus on colorectal cancer 
all of these investigational drug products are still in development and must be cleared for marketing by the appropriate regulatory authorities before they can be sold in any markets 
executive summary we believe that the future prospects for navidea continue to improve as we make progress in executing our strategic vision to become a leader in precision diagnostics 
our primary development efforts over the last few years have been focused on the development of our now approved lymphoseek product candidate  as well as more recently on our other pipeline programs  including nav  nav and rigscan 
we expect our overall research and development expenditures to continue to be significantly higher during as compared to due to the expansion of our clinical  regulatory  and business development staff and efforts that support the commercialization of lymphoseek  further development of lymphoseek  nav  nav and rigscan  and the potential sourcing and development of additional pipeline product candidates 
the level to which the expenditures rise will depend on how successful we are in commercializing lymphoseek and on the extent to which we are able to execute on our strategic development initiatives

rigscan o awarded a small business innovation research grant from the national institutes of health for development of a radioimmunoguided surgery agent aimed at detecting metastatic cancer  with potential for grant money up to a total of million over three years if fully funded 
our outlook with the us approval of lymphoseek on march   the company is moving forward with preparations for commercial launch in the us with our marketing partner  cardinal health  expected in the second quarter of as such  we expect to report revenue from lymphoseek in the second quarter of however  as we do not yet have experience and insight into the level of potential sales success we may achieve with lymphoseek  we do not currently expect to provide revenue guidance for excluding the results of our discontinued operations  as discussed below  our operating expenses over the last three years have been focused primarily on support of lymphoseek and nav product development  and to a lesser extent  on efforts to restart active development of rigscan 
in addition  during we paid million in option and sublicense fees million of which was non cash in nature related to a sublicense agreement with alseres for the exclusive worldwide license of nav we spent approximately million  million and million in total on research and development activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
following the sale of the gds business  our entire organization is focused on the development of radiopharmaceutical agents that fulfill our vision of becoming a leader in precision diagnostics 
of the total amounts we have spent on research and development over the last three years  excluding costs related to our internal research and development headcount and our general and administrative staff which we do not currently allocate among the various development programs that we have underway  we incurred out of pocket charges by program as follows development program lymphoseek    nav   nav  rigscan    due to the advancement of our efforts with lymphoseek  nav  nav  rigscan  and potentially other programs  we expect our total drug related development and commercialization expenses for to increase significantly over the specific levels to which each program s expenditures may rise will depend in part on how successful we are in commercializing lymphoseek and on the extent to which we draw on the other financial resources we have at our disposal 
in general  development expenses in for lymphoseek are expected to decrease as compared to while expenses related to nav  nav and rigscan are all currently expected to increase in over during  we expect to incur additional development expenses related to supporting the marketing authorization application maa review of lymphoseek in the eu  our neo clinical trial and studies to support lymphoseek in a potential post commercialization setting  and support the other product activities related to the potential marketing registration of lymphoseek in other markets 
in addition  we expect to incur significant costs during to support our business development and commercialization activities surrounding lymphoseek 
we cannot assure you that lymphoseek will achieve regulatory approval in the eu or any other market outside the us  or if approved  that it will achieve market acceptance 
we also expect to incur significant expenses for nav during related to ongoing additional phase clinical trials and the initiation of a phase clinical study in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and a pivotal phase clinical trial in subjects with ad  as well as costs for manufacturing related activities required prior to filing for regulatory clearance to market 
nav is currently not expected to contribute revenue to the company until at the earliest 
we cannot assure you that further clinical trials for this product will be successful  that the agent will ultimately achieve regulatory approval  or if approved  the extent to which it will achieve market acceptance 
we expect to incur significant expenses for nav during related to initiation of phase and phase clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing related activities required to support clinical activities and to prepare to file for regulatory clearance to market 
nav is not expected to generate revenue for the company until at the earliest 
we cannot assure you that clinical trials for this product will be successful  that the agent will ultimate achieve regulatory approval  or if approved  the extent to which it will achieve market acceptance 
we are in the process of evaluating the business  manufacturing  development and regulatory pathways forward with respect to rigscan 
we believe that the time required for continued development  regulatory approval and commercialization of a rigscan product would likely be a minimum of five years before we receive any significant product related royalties or revenues 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete satisfactory development arrangements or obtain incremental financing to fund development of the rigs technology and cannot guarantee that such arrangements could be obtained on a timely basis on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also cannot assure you that further clinical development will be successful  that the fda or the european medicines agency ema will clear rigscan for marketing  or that it will be successfully introduced or achieve market acceptance 
finally  if we are successful in identifying and securing additional product candidates to augment our product development pipeline  we will likely incur significant additional expenses related to furthering the development of such products

costs related to in licensing  acquiring and developing other late stage radiopharmaceutical candidates that we are evaluating  coupled with development costs related to our existing product candidates  may result in the use of a material portion of our available funds 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our ability to complete the development and commercialization of new products  our ability to achieve market acceptance of our products  our ability to monetize our investment in non core technologies  our ability to obtain milestone or development funds from potential development and distribution partners  regulatory actions by the fda and international regulatory bodies  the ability to procure additional pipeline development opportunities and required financial resources  and intellectual property protection 
we have developed a plan which will allow the company to have adequate funding  and we believe that our credit facility with montaur  anticipated revenue deriving from us sales of lymphoseek following a second quarter commercial launch  and our access to capital markets through our shelf registration provide us with access to adequate financial resources to continue to fund our business plan 
however  we cannot assure you that lymphoseek will generate our expected levels of sales and cash flow 
we will continue to evaluate our timelines and strategic needs  and although we have not decided whether  when or how much additional capital might be raised under the shelf registration statement or the credit facility  we will continue our efforts to maintain a strong balance sheet 
even if we decide to attempt to raise additional capital  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in doing so on terms acceptable to the company  or at all 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to gain access and or be able to execute on securing new development opportunities  successfully obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize new products  achieve significant product revenues from our products  or achieve or sustain profitability in the future

recent accounting developments in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb and international accounting standards board iasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss asu 
asu created a uniform framework for applying fair value measurement principles for companies around the world and clarified existing guidance in us gaap 
asu was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  and was applied prospectively 
asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we base our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  upon our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we describe our significant accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we include within these policies our critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most subjective and complex judgment due to the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in estimates and assumptions based upon actual results may have a material impact on our results of operations and or financial condition 
revenue recognition 
we currently generate revenue primarily from grants to support various product development initiatives 
we generally recognize grant revenue when expenses reimbursable under the grants have been incurred and payments under the grants become contractually due 
we also recognize revenue from the reimbursement by our partners of certain expenditures for which the company has principal responsibility 
research and development 
research and development r d expenses include both internal r d activities and external contracted services 
internal r d activity expenses include salaries  benefits  and stock based compensation  as well as travel  supplies  and other costs to support our r d staff 
external contracted services include clinical trial activities  cmc related activities  and regulatory costs 
r d expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
we review and accrue r d expenses based on services performed and rely upon estimates of those costs applicable to the stage of completion of each project 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management may make significant estimates in the following areas stock based compensation 
stock based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options and restricted stock  are recognized in the statements of operations based on their estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model to value share based payments and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense over either the requisite service period or the estimated performance period 
the determination of fair value using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option behaviors 
we estimate the expected term based on the contractual term of the awards and employees exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior 
the restricted stock awards are valued based on the closing stock price on the date of grant and amortized ratably over the estimated life of the award 
since stock based compensation is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised  if necessary  in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
our valuation reflects our estimates of excess and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value 
write offs are recorded when product is removed from saleable inventory 
we review inventory on hand at least quarterly and record provisions for excess and obsolete inventory based on several factors  including current assessment of future product demand  anticipated release of new products into the market and product expiration 
our industry is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  regulations regarding use and shelf life  product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
fair value of derivative instruments 
derivative instruments embedded in contracts  to the extent not already a free standing contract  are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value in accordance with current accounting guidelines for such complex financial instruments 
unrealized gains and losses on the derivatives are classified in other expenses as a change in derivative liabilities in the statements of operations 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging of market risks or for trading or speculative purposes 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total and after capital lease obligation     operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations a   principal and interest on short term debt   principal and interest on long term debt   total contractual cash obligations   a this amount represents purchases under binding purchase orders for which we are required to take delivery of the product under the terms of the underlying supply agreement going out approximately months 
this table does not include obligations such as license agreements  contracted services  or employment agreements as such obligations are dependent upon performance conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
as of december   our million in cash was primarily invested in interest bearing money market accounts 
due to the low interest rates being realized on these accounts  we believe that a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we also have exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt obligations 
as of december   the interest rate on the majority of our debt obligations was based on the us prime rate 
based on the amount of our variable rate borrowings at december   which totaled approximately million  an immediate one percentage point increase in the us prime rate would increase our annual interest expense by approximately  this estimate assumes that the amount of variable rate borrowings remains constant for an annual period and that the interest rate change occurs at the beginning of the period 
because our debt obligations are currently subject to the minimum interest rates defined in the loan agreements  a decrease in the us prime rate would not affect our annual interest expense 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure related to our assets as the majority are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately   and  of foreign currency transaction losses  respectively 
equity price risk 
we do not use derivative instruments for hedging of market risks or for trading or speculative purposes 
derivative instruments embedded in contracts  to the extent not already a free standing contract  are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
all derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value in accordance with current accounting guidelines for such complex financial instruments 
the fair value of warrant liabilities is determined using various inputs and assumptions  one of which is the market price of company stock 
as of december   we did not have any derivative liabilities recorded on our balance sheet 
as such  we do not believe we are exposed to any equity price risk related to derivative instruments
