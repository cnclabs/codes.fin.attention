item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion analyzes our consolidated financial condition as of december  and  and our consolidated results of operations for the years then ended 
we are considered a smaller reporting company under applicable regulations of the sec and are therefore eligible for relief from certain disclosure requirements 
in accordance with such provisions  we have elected to provide our audited consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss  cash flows and changes in stockholders equity for two  rather than three  years

the end result is the delivery of a customer experience which requires little effort by our clients customers 
to become a leader in the market  our strategy is to grow our existing client base by deepening and broadening our relationships  add new clients and continue to diversify our client base  improve the profitability of our business through operational improvements  increased utilization  expand our global delivery platform to meet our clients needs  and broaden our service offerings by providing more innovative and technology enabled solutions 
over the past several years  we have closed and opened several operating centers which has changed the way in which management and our chief operating decision maker evaluate performance and allocate resources 
as a result  during the quarter ended march   we revised our business segments  consistent with our management of the business and internal financial reporting structure 
specifically  we consolidated our us and canadian segments into our domestic segment and created two new segments  asia pacific and latin america  which were previously reported in our offshore segment 
as of december   our domestic segment included the operations of five facilities in the us and two facilities in canada 
our asia pacific segment included the operations of two facilities in the philippines  and our latin america segment included one facility in costa rica and one facility in honduras 
in and  we received lower call volumes in our domestic facilities  which adversely affected our results 
partially offsetting lower call volumes in north america has been strong demand for our offshore call center services  primarily in our asia pacific segment 
we have observed that our clients are decreasing the number of agents handling calls by leveraging call disposition technology  and there continues to be a shift toward outsourced and offshore providers 
while the increased use of call disposition technology has somewhat adversely impacted our financial results  the shift toward outsourced and offshore providers has positively impacted our business due to our expanded presence in the philippines  costa rica and honduras 
part of our strategy  as noted above  is to further expand our geographic footprint offshore and near shore to capitalize on this trend and to diversify geographic risk 
we also believe our clients and potential clients are seeking front and back office business processes to increase operating efficiencies in order to enhance their customer experience 
we are positioned to benefit from this trend as we have developed a comprehensive suite of services which includes front and back office offerings for our clients 
significant developments during the year ended december  jonesboro  arkansas and decatur  illinois in february  we received written customer notifications that they would be reducing business in our jonesboro  arkansas and decatur  illinois facilities 
the reductions resulted in approximately million less revenue during as compared to  and decreased gross profit by million  compared to in the first half of  we incurred approximately million in impairment losses and restructuring costs related to these two facilities as the carrying values of the long lived assets were not recoverable by future cash flows 
we have successfully secured new business for the jonesboro facility 
however  we are not pursuing new business for the decatur facility and consequently recorded a million restructuring reserve in the second quarter of enid  oklahoma during the second quarter of  we reclassified the enid  oklahoma facility as assets held for sale because we have decided to sell the facility 
it was determined that the fair market value was greater than the net book value  therefore no adjustment was made to the net book value and we have reclassified million to assets held for sale 
regina  saskatchewan during the third quarter of  we recorded an additional million restructuring reserve for this location closed in the second quarter of this additional reserve was required due to the reassessment of early lease termination timing 
the reserve now reflects our lease obligation through the first quarter of even though the lease expires july   we believe the probability is high that early termination will occur prior to the end of the first quarter of grand junction  colorado during the third quarter of  we transitioned from one facility to another facility previously occupied 
this move resulted in the reversal of a portion of a restructuring reserve recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the grand junction  colorado facility that has been re opened 
subsequent events in february  we announced the closure of our cornwall  ontario facility due to an end of life client program 
operations will cease during the second quarter of this follows the reduction of business which resulted in the renegotiation of the facility lease for a smaller portion of the space 
results of operations years ended december  and december  the following table summarizes our revenues and gross profit for the periods indicated  by reporting segment for the year ended december  in s of total in s of total domestic revenue cost of services gross profit gross profit asia pacific revenue cost of services gross profit gross profit latin america revenue cost of services gross profit gross profit company total revenue cost of services gross profit gross profit revenue revenue decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease was driven by the domestic segment 
revenue in the domestic segment decreased by  or million  due in part to five site closures that occurred over the past year in alexandria  virginia  collinsville  virginia  enid  oklahoma  decatur  illinois and kingston  ontario 
these closures resulted in million less revenue in as compared to in addition  the downsizing of our facility in cornwall  ontario during resulted in approximately million less revenue in compared to the ramp down of business in our jonesboro  arkansas facility resulted in million less revenue in compared to other revenue increased by million driven by new business bookings during asia pacific revenue increased  or million  from million to million due primarily to the ramp up of new business 
revenue in our latin america segment increased million or from million in to million in due to new business in our honduras location  which opened in the fall of  and the ramp up of additional business in our costa rica facility 
our client base was more diversified during as compared to as the growth in asia pacific and latin america was fueled by higher call volumes from two clients who have not historically been among our largest clients  which was more than offset by lower call volumes domestically from our largest client 
cost of services and gross profit cost of services decreased by million  or  from million in to million in gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in domestic cost of services decreased by approximately million due primarily to the site closures and ramp downs mentioned above 
domestic gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to in from in due to the efficiency improvements and capacity consolidation 
cost of services in the asia pacific segment increased by approximately million  or 
the increase was in support of new business in both facilities 
asia pacific gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from in to in the improvement was due to the higher utilization as a result of new business launched over the past year 
cost of services in latin america increased by approximately million  or 
the increase was primarily due to the opening of a new facility in honduras in  as well as an increase in headcount in costa rica mentioned above resulting from new business launches 
latin america gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from to due to the higher headcount and utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in severance expense of million  staff related expense of million  legal fees of million and depreciation of million 
impairment losses and restructuring charges impairment losses and restructuring charges totaled million and million for and  respectively 
the million expense in consisted of the following activities in our domestic segment million of impairment losses related to long lived assets such as computer equipment  software  equipment and furniture and fixtures for which the future cash flows did not support the carrying value of the assets in our decatur  illinois and jonesboro  arkansas facilities  million of restructuring charges related to lease  utilities  maintenance  and security expense that will continue to be incurred for the decatur  illinois location  million of restructuring charges related to revised estimates of our expected lease term for our regina  saskatchewan site  partially offset by a reversal of million of restructuring charges related to our grand junction  colorado site that was re opened in the third quarter of operating loss we reported an operating loss of million in and million in operating loss as a percentage of revenue was for compared to for the reduction in operating loss was due in large part to higher gross profit and lower selling  general and administrative expenses  as previously discussed 
income tax income tax expense for was million compared to a benefit of million in the income tax expense is the tax impact of the sale of the kingston  ontario facility of million in addition to the income tax provision for canadian operations offset by a full valuation allowance recorded on our us deferred tax assets and tax holidays in the philippines  costa rica and honduras 
net loss net loss was million for and million for the decreased net loss was due to improved gross profit and lower selling  general and administrative expenses  and lower impairment and restructuring charges  partially offset by increased income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are generally cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have historically utilized these resources to finance our operations and make capital expenditures associated with capacity expansion and upgrades of information technologies and service offerings 
due to the timing of our collections of large billings with our major customers  we have historically needed to draw on our line of credit for ongoing operating activities 
as of december   working capital totaled million and our current ratio was  compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of at december  the increase in working capital of approximately million was primarily due to a million increase in accounts receivable  the result of increased revenues in the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of our days sales outstanding dso remained consistent at days for both and we compute dso as follows period end receivables  net of allowances  divided by the average daily revenue 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for was million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the million increase in net cash flows from operating activities was due to a million increase in net income  offset by a million net decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities and a million decrease in non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  and stock based compensation 
the million net decrease in cash flows from assets and liabilities was principally a result of decreased receivables collections of million due to the revenue decline in versus this impact was offset by a reduction in payments made under our restructuring plans in versus  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities in of million consisted of million of capital expenditures  offset by the proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction of our kingston  ontario property of million 
this compares to net cash used in investing activities of million primarily for capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities of seven thousand was primarily attributed to proceeds from purchases of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan offset by payments on capital lease obligations 
during the year ended december  we borrowed and repaid approximately million on our credit facility 
there was no outstanding balance on our credit facility as of december  and we were in compliance with our covenants 
after consideration for issued letters of credit under the credit agreement  totaling million  our remaining borrowing capacity was million as of december   which we believe  together with cash on hand and anticipated cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next year 
contractual obligations as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide tabular disclosure obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet transactions  unconditional purchase obligations or similar instruments and we are not a guarantor of any other entities debt or other financial obligations 
variability of operating results we have experienced and expect to continue to experience some quarterly variations in revenue and operating results due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including i timing and amount of costs incurred to expand capacity in order to provide for volume growth from existing and future clients  ii changes in the volume of services provided to principal clients  iii expiration or termination of client projects or contracts  iv timing of existing and future client product launches or service offerings  v seasonal nature of certain clients businesses  and vi variability in demand for our services by our clients depending on demand for their products or services and or depending on our performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically  on at least an annual basis  evaluate potential impairments of our long lived assets 
in our annual evaluation or when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more indicators of impairment  we evaluate the projected undiscounted cash flows related to the assets 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets  we measure the impairment based on the excess of the carrying value of the long lived asset over the long lived asset s fair value 
where appropriate we use a probability weighted approach to determine our future cash flows  based upon our estimate of the likelihood of certain scenarios  primarily whether we expect to sell new business within a current location 
these estimates are consistent with our internal projections and external communications and public disclosures 
our projections contain assumptions pertaining to anticipated levels of utilization and revenue that may or may not be under contract but are based on our experience and or projections received from our customers 
if our estimate of the probability of different scenarios changed by  the impact to our financial statements would not be material 
as described in note  impairment losses and restructuring charges  during the year ended december   we recorded impairment losses in our domestic segment  due to the impairment of certain long lived assets for which the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable based upon our estimated future cash flows 
given that the impairment losses were valued using internal estimates of future cash flows  we have classified the remaining fair value of long lived assets as level in the fair value hierarchy 
restructuring charges on an ongoing basis  management assesses the profitability and utilization of our facilities and in some cases management has chosen to close facilities 
severance payments that occur from reductions in workforce are in accordance with our postemployment plans and or statutory requirements that are communicated to all employees upon hire date  therefore  severance liabilities are recognized when they are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
other liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred  instead of upon commitment to an exit plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a facility is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant facilities 
we determine our estimate of sublease based on our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords  a third party broker or management s assessment of our ability to sublease the facility based upon the market conditions in which the facility is located 
if the assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a future gain 
we expect to pay approximately million of additional restructuring charges under our victoria and regina plans which we expect to incur in during  we recorded approximately million for an additional accrual related to our regina facility due to changes in our estimates regarding our expected lease term 
during  we established an accrual of approximately million related to our decatur  illinois facility due to a reduction in business 
the site closed in january accrued restructuring costs were valued using a discounted cash flow model 
significant assumptions used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing a facility are the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant facilities and the discount rate utilized to determine the present value of the future expected cash flows 
as described in note  impairment losses and restructuring charges  during the years ended december  and  we closed several facilities 
these costs were valued using a discounted cash flow model 
the cash flows consist of the future lease payment obligations required under the lease agreement 
we assumed that we could sublease the facility in grand junction for a portion of the remaining lease term based on our knowledge of the respective marketplace  as well as our historical ability to sublease our facilities in other locations in which we operate 
we assumed that we could complete a buy out of the facility in regina  saskatchewan due to ongoing negotiations with the landlord of this facility 
in the future  if we sublease for periods that differ from our assumption or if our estimate of a buy out differs from our assumption  we may be required to record a gain or loss 
future cash flows also include estimated property taxes through the remainder of the lease term  which are valued based upon historical tax payments 
given that the restructuring charges were valued using our internal estimates using a discounted cash flow model  we have classified the accrued restructuring costs as level in the fair value hierarchy 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we record derivative instruments as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  with changes in the fair value of qualifying hedges recorded in other comprehensive income 
as of december   we recorded a gross derivative asset related to our unrealized gains of approximately million and a gross derivative liability related to our unrealized losses of approximately million 
changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset the related results of the hedged item and requires that we must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting treatment 
we are generally able to apply cash flow hedge accounting which associates the results of the hedges with forecasted future expenses 
the current mark to market gain or loss is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be re classified to operations as the forecasted expenses are incurred  typically within one year 
during and  our cash flow hedges were highly effective and there were no amounts charged for hedge ineffectiveness 
while we expect that our derivative instruments that have been designated as hedges will continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges do not qualify as highly effective or if we do not believe that forecasted transactions will occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges will be reflected in earnings 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect net effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
we are subject to foreign income taxes on our foreign operations 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences are recorded as deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period during which such rates are enacted 
we record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that we will not realize the net deferred tax assets in a certain jurisdiction 
we consider all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become realizable 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities including the impact of available carryback and carryforward periods  and projected taxable income in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
based on all available evidence  in particular our historical cumulative losses  recent operating losses and a us pre tax loss for the fiscal year ending december   we recorded a valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
in order to fully realize the us deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future periods before the expiration of the deferred tax assets governed by the tax code 
as of december   we had gross federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million expiring through and gross state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million expiring through we record tax benefits when they are more likely than not to be realized 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update  technical corrections and improvements asu 
the amendments in this update cover a wide range of topics in the accounting standards codification 
these amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the accounting standards codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued accounting standard update  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
the intent of asu is to simplify how registrants test indefinite lived intangible asset for impairment and to improve consistency in impairment testing guidance among long lived asset categories 
asu permits registrants to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
an entity will have an option not to calculate annually the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the entity determines that it is not more likely than not that the asset is impaired 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risks we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations when subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar usd are translated into our usd consolidated financial statements 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows caused by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates 
the contracts cover periods commensurate with expected exposure  generally three to nine months  and are principally unsecured 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the usd are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
movements in non us dollar currency exchange rates may negatively or positively affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
we serve many of our us based clients in several us locations  such as canada  the philippines  costa rica and honduras 
our client contracts are primarily priced and invoiced in us dollars  however  the functional currencies of our canadian and philippine operations are the canadian dollar cad and the philippine peso php  respectively 
in costa rica and honduras  our functional currency is the usd and the majority of our costs are denominated in us dollars 
in order to hedge a portion of our anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in the canadian dollar and philippine peso we had outstanding forward contracts as of december  with notional amounts totaling million 
the average contractual exchange rate for the cad contracts is and for the php contracts is as of december   we had net total derivative assets associated with these contracts with a fair value of million  which will settle within the next months 
if the usd were to weaken against the canadian dollar and philippine peso by from current period end levels  we would incur a loss of approximately million on the underlying exposures of the derivative instruments 
however  this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
as of december   we have not entered into any arrangements to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the costa rican colon or the honduran lempira relative to the us dollar 
interest rate risk we currently have a million secured credit facility  which can increase to million 
the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the libor index  and therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
if the libor increased basis points  there would not be a material impact to our condensed consolidated financial statements
