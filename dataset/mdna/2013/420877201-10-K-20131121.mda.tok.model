company history the company began operations in as the haynes stellite works  which was purchased by union carbide and carbon corporation in in  the operations were sold to cabot corporation 
in  haynes was incorporated as a stand alone corporation in delaware  and in haynes was sold by cabot corporation to morgan lewis githens ahn inc  a private investment firm 
the blackstone group  a private investment firm  purchased haynes from morgan lewis githens ahn inc in on march   haynes and its us subsidiaries and affiliates as of that date filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on august   haynes emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a court approved plan of reorganization 
in november  haynes acquired certain assets of the branford wire company  including a facility that manufactured both stainless steel wire and high performance alloy wire 
the company primarily produces high performance alloy wire at the haynes wire company  in mountain home  north carolina 
on march   the company completed an equity offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of its common stock 
simultaneously the company listed its common stock on the nasdaq global market 
the company began paying a dividend in fiscal products the global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors stainless steel  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
the company believes that the high performance alloy sector represents less than of the total alloy market 
the company competes primarily in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sectors  which includes hta products and cra products 
in fiscal  and  hta products accounted for approximately  and of the company net revenues  respectively  and sales of the company cra products accounted for approximately  and of the company net revenues  respectively 
these percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the company to its foreign subsidiaries  but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers 
management believes  
table of contents however  that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section 
high temperature resistant alloys 
hta products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines 
stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace related market applications for hta products 
however  once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market  it tends to remain in use for extended periods 
hta products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels  electric power generation  power sources for offshore drilling platforms  gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power generators

patent filing date 
patents and trademarks the company currently maintains a total of approximately us patents and applications and approximately foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products and continues to develop  manufacture and test high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
since fiscal  the company technical programs have yielded eight new proprietary alloys  four of which are currently commercially available and four of which are being scaled up to be brought to market 
the alloys being commercialized saw significant further advancement in the process during fiscal haynes alloy  which management believes will have significant commercial potential for the company in the long term  is the subject of a us patent issued in haynes alloy has excellent formability  fabricability and forgeability 
the commercial launch of haynes alloy occurred in october and  since that time  there have been a significant number of customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets  as well as for automotive and other high temperature applications 
the alloy has also been specified into a major aerospace engine component 
the company will continue to actively promote haynes alloy through customer engineering visits and technical presentations and papers 

table of contents for the chemical processing industry  hastelloy g alloy has found extensive applications  particularly in wet phosphoric acid production 
management expects demand for this alloy will continue to grow 
commercialization of hastelloy c hs alloy also continued in fiscal the company continues to provide customers with samples of this alloy and making technical presentations 
testing and evaluation of the alloy is ongoing with special emphasis on applications for the oil and gas market 
two major orders were received and shipped for hastelloy c hs alloy for oil and gas applications 
one of those orders was shipped in fiscal  and the second shipped in fiscal the company believes that the alloys particularly haynes alloy are being commercialized rapidly when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the company 
in addition to haynes alloy  hastelloy g alloy and hastelloy c hs alloy  commercialization is also ongoing for hastelloy hybrid bc alloy 
this alloy is a cra product with potential applications in the chemical processing industry that has demonstrated resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid 
in addition to the commercialization of the above alloys  the company continues to develop applications for new alloys not yet ready to begin the commercialization process 
two new high temperature alloys  haynes ns alloy us patent granted in and haynes hr alloy us patent application filed in and granted in  are in the scale up phase 
both of these new materials are believed to have significant  medium to long term commercial potential 
haynes ns alloy is a new alloy with extraordinary high temperature strength in sheet form  which has applications in the aerospace  land based gas turbine and automotive markets 
data generation and fabrication trials continued through  with test marketing initiated in early haynes hr alloy is an hta product with superior resistance to oxidation 
scale up of this alloy is continuing and test marketing was initiated in fiscal a us patent application was filed in fiscal and granted in for haynes alloy 
this alloy has potential in aerospace and land based gas turbines 
it combines high strength to degrees fahrenheit with a low coefficient of thermal expansion 
scale up of this alloy began in fiscal and is ongoing 
most recently  haynes hr tm was introduced in fiscal this alloy has excellent resistance to metal dusting in carbonaceous high temperature environments 
potential uses include applications in petrochemical production and syngas plants 
scale up of this alloy is well underway and material is currently being evaluated by certain key customers 
patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the company business 
the company strategy is to file patent applications in the us and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the company 
in addition  the company seeks to protect technology which is important to the development of the company business 
the company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys 
the company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers 
trademarks on the names of many of the company alloys have also been applied for or granted in the us and certain foreign countries 
while the company believes its patents are important to its competitive position  significant barriers to entry continue to exist beyond the expiration of any patent period 
these barriers to entry include the unique equipment required to produce this material and the exacting process required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties 
these processing requirements include such items as specific annealing temperature  processing speeds and reduction per rolling pass 
management believes that the current alloy development program and these barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the company 
end markets the global specialty alloy market consists of stainless steels  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
of this total market  the company competes in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sector 
the high performance alloy market demands diverse specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing 
given the technologically advanced nature of the products  strict requirements of the end users and higher growth end markets  the company 
table of contents believes the high performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential  higher profit margins and greater opportunities for service  product and price differentiation than stainless steels and general purpose nickel alloys 
while stainless steel and general purpose nickel alloy is generally sold in bulk through third party distributors  the company products are sold in smaller sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct to customer basis 
aerospace 
the company has manufactured hta products for the aerospace market since the late s  and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market 
customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specifications within very precise tolerances and achieving new product performance standards 
stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight and develop more fuel efficient designs require close coordination between the company and its customers in the selection and development of hta products 
as a result  sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the company direct sales force 
demand for the company products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft 
the company specializes in the static parts included in the hot sections of the jet engine 
the hot sections are subjected to substantial wear and tear and accordingly require periodic maintenance  repair and overhaul 
the company views the maintenance  repair and overhaul mro business as an area of continuing long term growth 
chemical processing 
the chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse cra applications driven by demand for key end use markets such as automobiles  housing  health care  agriculture and metals production 
cra products supplied by the company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early s 
demand for the company products in this market is driven by the level of mro and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities  as well as the construction of new facilities 
the north america expansion of manufacturing of natural gas liquids will be a driver of demand in this market 
the company believes the extensive worldwide network of company owned service and sales centers  as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company direct sales efforts outside of the us  provide a competitive advantage in marketing its cra products in the chemical processing market 
land based gas turbines 
demand for the company products in this market is driven by the construction of cogeneration facilities such as base load for electric utilities or as backup sources to fossil fuel fired utilities during times of peak demand 
demand for the company alloys in the land based gas turbine markets has also been driven by concerns regarding lowering emissions from generating facilities powered by fossil fuels 
land based gas turbine generating facilities have gained acceptance as clean  low cost alternatives to fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
land based gas turbines are also used in power barges with mobility and as temporary base load generating units for countries that have numerous islands and a large coastline 
demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation  as well as microturbines that are used as back up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls 
other markets 
other markets to which the company sells its hta products and cra products include flue gas desulphurization fgd  oil and gas  waste incineration  industrial heat treating  automotive  instrumentation  biopharmaceuticals  solar and nuclear fuel 
the fgd market has been driven by both legislated and self imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
this market is expected to soften if the trend to switch from coal to natural gas for power plants continues 
the company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market  primarily in connection with sour gas production 
in addition  incineration of municipal  biological  industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys 
the company continues to look for opportunities to introduce and expand the use of its alloys in emerging technologies such as solar and nuclear fuel applications 
markets capable of providing growth are 
table of contents being driven by increasing performance  reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets which could provide further applications for the company products 
sales and marketing and distribution the company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization  which operates from total locations in the us  europe and asia  of which are service and or sales centers 
all of the company service and or sales centers are operated either directly by the company or through its wholly owned subsidiaries 
approximately of the company net revenues in fiscal were generated by the company direct sales organization 
the remaining of the company fiscal net revenues was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company direct sales in the us  europe and asia  some of whom have been associated with the company for over years 
going forward  the company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately of its total net revenues 
providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the company marketing strategy 
the company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers 
these analyses enable the company to evaluate the performance of its products and to make recommendations as to the use of those products in appropriate applications  enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers products 
the company market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities 
management believes the company combination of direct sales  technical marketing  engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high performance alloy industry 
this activity allows the company to obtain direct insight into customers alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers problems 
the company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets 
in recent years  the company opened a service and sales center in china and sales centers in singapore  india  italy and japan 
while the company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales  the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to us customers 
the company domestic expansion effort includes  but is not limited to  the continued expansion of ancillary product forms  the continued development of new high performance alloys  the addition of equipment in us service and sales centers to improve the company ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort through the technical expertise of the company to find solutions to customer challenges 
the following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the company fiscal net revenues generated through each of the company distribution channels 
from domestic locations from foreign locations total company mill direct service and sales centers independent distributors sales agents total the company top twenty customers accounted for approximately  and of the company net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no customer or group of affiliated customers of the company accounted for more than of the company net revenues in fiscal  or net revenues and net income in fiscal  and were generated primarily by the company us operations 
sales to domestic customers comprised approximately  and of 
table of contents the company net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the majority of the company operating costs are incurred in the us  as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the us it is expected that net revenues and net income will continue to be highly dependent on the company domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the us the company foreign and export sales were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
additional information concerning foreign operations and export sales is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
manufacturing process high performance alloys require a lengthier  more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower performance alloys  such as stainless steel 
the alloying elements in high performance alloys must be highly refined during melting  and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties 
the resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because  by design  it is more resistant to deformation 
consequently  high performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging 
this results in more cycles of rolling  annealing and pickling compared to a lower performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions 
certain alloys may undergo or more distinct stages of melting  remelting  annealing  hot reduction  cold reduction  pickling and testing before they achieve the specifications required by a customer 
this longer production cycle contributes to slower inventory turns 
the company manufactures its high performance alloys in various forms  including sheet  plate  billet ingot  tubular  wire and other forms 
the company also preforms value added cutting services to supply certain customers with product cut to their specification 
at the kokomo  indiana facility  the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined  melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high performance alloy 
the company primary melt facility utilizes two different melting processes 
the argon oxygen decarburization process utilizes gas controls to remove carbon and other undesirable elements  thereby allowing more tightly controlled chemistries  which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high performance alloys 
the other primary melt method utilizes vacuum induction melting which involves the melting of raw materials through electromagnetic induction while under vacuum conditions to produce the desired tightly controlled chemistry 
the control systems allow for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality 
for most high performance alloys  this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting 
the resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form 
intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling  annealing and pickling operations before being cut to final size 
the company has a four high steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high performance alloys  created specifically for that purpose 
the four high steckel rolling mill was installed in and is one of the most powerful four high steckel rolling mills in the world 
the mill is capable of generating approximately million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to inches wide 
the mill includes integrated computer controls with automatic gauge control and programmed rolling schedules  two coiling steckel furnaces and six heating furnaces 
computer controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers 
the company also operates a three high hot rolling mill and a two high hot rolling mill  each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four high steckel rolling mill 
these mills provide the company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements 
the company believes the flexibility provided by the three high and 
table of contents two high mills provides the company with an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders 
the arcadia  louisiana facility uses feedstock produced at the kokomo facility to fabricate welded and seamless alloy pipe and tubing and purchases extruded tube hollows to produce seamless titanium tubing 
the manufacturing processes at arcadia require cold pilger mills  weld mills  draw benches  annealing furnaces and pickling facilities 
the mountain home  north carolina facility primarily manufactures finished high performance alloy wire 
finished wire products are also warehoused at this facility 
backlog the company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices 
approximately of the orders in the backlog at any given time include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs 
historically  approximately of the company backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately have shipped within months 
the backlog figures do not typically reflect that portion of the company business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or just in time basis 
for additional discussion of backlog  see item management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations contained in this annual report on form k 
consolidated backlog at fiscal quarter end in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter raw materials raw materials represented of cost of sales in fiscal nickel  a major component of many of the company products  accounted for approximately of raw material costs  or approximately of total cost of sales in fiscal other raw materials include cobalt  chromium  molybdenum and tungsten 
melt materials consist of virgin raw material  purchased scrap and internally produced scrap 
the average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the day period ended on september   and  as reported by the london metals exchange  was  and  respectively 
prices for other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the company products  such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium  were also lower in fiscal than in fiscal although alternative sources of supply are available  the company currently purchases nickel through an exclusive arrangement with a single supplier to ensure consistent quality and supply 
the company purchases raw materials through various arrangements including fixed term contracts and spot purchases  which involve a variety of pricing mechanisms 
in cases where the company prices its products at the time of order placement  the company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials  thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly  there may be a favorable or unfavorable effect on the company gross profit margins 
the company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers 
in the event the company enters into a forward purchase which is not matched to one or more customer contracts with fixed raw material prices or if a customer fails to meet the expected volume levels 
table of contents or the consumption schedule deviates from the expected schedule  a rapid or prolonged decrease in the price of raw materials could adversely affect the company operating results 
the company values inventory utilizing the first in  first out fifo inventory costing methodology 
under the fifo inventory costing method  the cost of materials included in cost of sales may be different than the current market price at the time of sale of finished product due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw material to the sale of the finished product 
in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the fifo inventory valuation method normally results in higher costs of sales as compared to last in  first out method 
conversely  in a period of rising raw material costs  the fifo inventory valuation method normally results in lower costs of sales 
research and technical support the company technology facilities are located at the kokomo headquarters and consist of  square feet of offices and laboratories  as well as an additional  square feet of paved storage area 
the company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories  including a mechanical test lab  a metallographic lab  an electron microscopy lab  a corrosion lab  a high temperature lab and a welding lab 
these facilities also contain a reduced scale  fully equipped melt shop and process lab 
as of september   the technology  engineering and technological testing staff consisted of persons  of whom have engineering or science degrees  including with doctoral degrees  with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering or materials science 
research and technical support costs primarily relate to efforts to develop new proprietary alloys and new applications for existing alloys 
the company spent approximately million  million and million for research and technical support activities for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  research and development projects were focused on new alloy development  new product form development and new alloy concept validation  relating to products for the aerospace  land based gas turbine  chemical processing and oil and gas industries 
in addition  significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy  fuel cell systems  biotechnology including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing  and power generation 
competition the high performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten major producers participate in various product forms 
the company primary competitors in flat rolled products include special metals corporation  a subsidiary of precision cast parts  allegheny technologies  inc and outokumpu vdm 
the company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high performance alloys similar to those the company produces and other competing metals 
the company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed  such as plastics or ceramics  that may be substituted for the company products 
the company also believes that it will face increased competition from non us entities in the next five to ten years  especially from competitors located in eastern europe and asia 
additionally  in recent years the company domestic business has benefited from a weak us dollar  which makes the goods of foreign competitors more expensive to import into the us in the event that the us dollar continues to strengthen  the company may face increased competition in the us from foreign competitors 
during fiscal  the company experienced strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys due primarily to weakness in both markets 
increased competition has required the company to continually price its products competitively  which has contributed to the reduction in the company gross profit margin and net income 
when demand begins to improve  price competition in the high performance alloy industry should begin to ease 
the company 
table of contents continues to respond to this competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving its cost structure and striving to improve delivery times and reliability 
employees as of september   the company employed approximately  full time employees worldwide 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo  indiana and arcadia  louisiana plants  and the lebanon  indiana service center approximately in the aggregate are covered by two collective bargaining agreements 
management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
on december   the company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america which covers eligible hourly employees at the company arcadia  louisiana plant 
this agreement will expire in december on july   the company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america  which will expire in june the agreement covers eligible hourly employees at the kokomo  indiana plant and the lebanon  indiana service center 
environmental matters the company facilities and operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
in the us  such laws include the occupational safety and health act  the clean air act  the clean water act  the toxic substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
as environmental laws and regulations continue to evolve  it is likely the company will be subject to increasingly stringent environmental standards in the future  particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change issues  such as a reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facility improvements 
expenses related to environmental compliance were approximately million for fiscal and are currently expected to be approximately million for fiscal although there can be no assurance  based upon current information available to the company  the company does not currently expect that costs of environmental contingencies  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities  who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws  regulations and permits 
in the past five years  the company has paid administrative fines  none of which have had a material effect on the company financial condition  for alleged violations relating to environmental matters  requirements relating to its title v air permit and alleged violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge 
capital expenditures of approximately million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal  with additional expenditures of approximately million for similar improvements planned for fiscal the company has received permits from the indiana department of environmental management  or idem  to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas at the kokomo facility previously used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the south landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care are permitted and ongoing there 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the north landfill at the kokomo facility  and post closure monitoring and care are permitted and ongoing there 
in fiscal  idem issued a single post closure permit applicable to both the north and south landfills  which contains monitoring and post closure care requirements and which was reviewed in fiscal in addition  idem required that a resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  facility investigation  or rfi  be conducted in order to further 
table of contents evaluate one area of concern and one solid waste management unit 
the rfi commenced in fiscal and is ongoing 
based on preliminary results  the company has determined that additional testing and further source remediation are necessary 
the company has also received permits from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  or ncdenr  to close and provide post closure monitoring and care for the hazardous waste lagoon at its mountain home  north carolina facility 
the lagoon area has been closed and is currently undergoing post closure monitoring and care 
the company is required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  the company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater  and additional corrective action by the company could be required 
the company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites  if required 
accordingly  the company cannot assure that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites would not have a material effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
additionally  it is possible that the company could be required to undertake other corrective action commitments for any other solid waste management unit or other conditions existing or determined to exist at its facilities 
as a condition of the post closure permits  the company must provide and maintain assurances to idem and ncdenr of the company capability to satisfy post closure groundwater monitoring requirements  including possible future corrective action as necessary 
the company provides these required assurances through a statutory financial assurance test as provided by indiana and north carolina law 
the company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company operations generate hazardous substances  and  while a large percentage of these substances are reclaimed or recycled  the company also accumulates hazardous substances at each of its facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or cercla  and state counterparts 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties 
the company is currently named as a potentially responsible party at one site 
the company may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at other sites potentially subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
thus  there can be no assurance that the company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
on august   the company received an information request from the united states environmental protection agency  or epa  relating to the company compliance with laws relating to air quality 
the company has responded to the request  and there has been no further action by the epa

risk factors risks related to our business our revenues may fluctuate widely based upon changes in demand for our customers products 
demand for our products is dependent upon and derived from the level of demand for the machinery  parts and equipment produced by our customers  which are principally manufacturers and fabricators of machinery  parts and equipment for highly specialized applications 
historically  certain of the markets in which we compete have experienced unpredictable  wide demand fluctuations 
because of the comparatively high level of fixed costs associated with our manufacturing processes  significant declines in those markets have had a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results 
since we became an independent company in  we have  in several instances  experienced substantial year to year declines in net revenues  primarily as a result of decreases in demand in the industries to which our products are sold 
in fiscal    and  our net revenues  when compared to the immediately preceding year  declined by approximately    and  respectively 
we may experience similar fluctuations in our net revenues in the future 
additionally  demand is likely to continue to be subject to substantial year to year fluctuations as a consequence of industry cyclicality  as well as other factors such as global economic uncertainty  and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
profitability in the high performance alloy industry is highly sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
the high performance alloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs 
the cost of raw materials is the primary variable cost in the manufacture of our high performance alloys and  in fiscal  represented approximately of our total cost of sales 
other manufacturing costs  such as labor  energy  maintenance and supplies  often thought of as variable  have a significant fixed element 
profitability is  therefore  very sensitive to changes in volume  and relatively small changes in volume can result in significant variations in earnings 
our ability to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets depends greatly upon continuing demand in our end markets  successfully increasing our market share and continued acceptance of our new products into the marketplace 
any failure to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets may negatively impact our gross margin and net income 
we are subject to risks associated with global economic and political uncertainties 
we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states and abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the demand of our customers 
the continuing turmoil in the global economy has had  and may continue to have  an adverse impact on our business and our financial condition 
in addition to the impact that the global financial crisis has already had  we may face significant challenges if conditions in the global economy do not improve or worsen 
in addition  we are subject to various domestic and international risks and uncertainties  including changing social conditions and uncertainties relating to the current and future political climate 
changes in governmental policies particularly those that would limit or reduce defense spending could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and may reduce our customers demand for our products and or depress pricing of those products used in the defense industry or which have other military applications  resulting in a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  results of operations  revenues and cash flows 
furthermore  any actual armed hostilities  and any future terrorist attacks in the us or abroad  could also have an adverse impact on the us economy  global financial markets and our business 
the effects may include  among other things  a decrease in demand in the aerospace industry due to reduced air travel  as well as reduced demand in the other industries we serve 
depending upon the severity  scope and duration of these effects  the impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be material 

table of contents we operate in cyclical markets 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the highly cyclical aerospace  power generation and chemical processing markets 
our sales to the aerospace industry constituted of our total sales in fiscal our land based gas turbine and chemical processing sales constituted and  respectively  of our total sales in fiscal the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft 
the us and international commercial aviation industries continue to face challenges arising from the global economic climate  competitive pressures and fuel costs 
demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by industry profitability  trends in airline passenger traffic  the state of us and world economies  the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors  including the effects of terrorism and health and safety concerns 
the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding  however  it is also driven by the effects of terrorism  a changing global political environment  us foreign policy  the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability 
accordingly  the timing  duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty 
downturns or reductions in demand for our products sold into the aerospace market could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the land based gas turbine market is also cyclical in nature 
demand for power generation products is global and is affected by the state of the us and world economies  the availability of financing to power generation project sponsors and the political environments of numerous countries 
the availability of fuels and related prices also have a large impact on demand 
reductions in demand for our products sold into the land based gas turbine industry may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also sell products into the chemical processing industry  which is also cyclical in nature 
customer demand for our products in this market may fluctuate widely depending on us and world economic conditions  the availability of financing  and the general economic strength of the end use customers in this market 
cyclical declines or sustained weakness in this market could have a material adverse effect on our business 
reductions in government expenditures or changes in spending priorities could adversely affect our military aerospace business 
the budget for the us department of defense may be reduced from current levels 
in addition to debt reduction efforts already authorized  it is possible that the us government could reduce or further delay its spending on  or reprioritize its spending away from  the military aerospace industry 
on november   the joint select committee on deficit reduction commonly referred to as the super committee which was established as part of the budget control act of the budget act failed to recommend legislation that would reduce net us government spending by at least trillion over the next years  which failure to act triggered directed automatic across the board cuts  known as sequestrations  beginning on january  then  on january   the american taxpayer relief act of atra was signed into law 
atra delayed the sequestrations created by the budget act for two months  until march  on march   with no deal reached  president obama signed an order putting the sequestrations into effect 
the sequestrations are automatic reductions of discretionary appropriations for us defense programs  which would make up the shortfall necessary to achieve the trillion target 
on october   as a result of congress inability to enact legislation appropriating funds for fiscal year  the us government entered a shutdown 
then  on october   congress agreed on a proposal to fund the government through january  at sequestration levels and suspend the debt limit until february  ultimately  the us government may be unable to timely complete its budget process or fully agree upon spending priorities and the us government may be forced to enter another shutdown or further extend the sequestrations 
while we are unable to predict the outcome of the 
table of contents budget deliberations  actions of congress or the impact of any resulting reductions in defense appropriations  reductions in us defense spending or changes in spending priorities  particularly with respect to the military aerospace industry  could negatively affect our revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
aerospace demand is primarily dependent on two manufacturers 
a significant portion of our aerospace products are sold to fabricators and are ultimately used in the production of new commercial aircraft 
there are only two primary manufacturers of large commercial aircraft in the world  the boeing company and airbus 
a significant portion of our aerospace sales are dependent on the number of new aircraft built by these two manufacturers  which is in turn dependent on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
those factors include demand for new aircraft from around the globe  success of new commercial and military aircraft programs and factors that impact manufacturing capabilities  such as the availability of raw materials and manufactured components  us and world economic conditions  changes in the regulatory environment and labor relations between the aircraft manufacturers and their work forces 
a significant interruption or slow down in the number of new aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are dependent on production levels at our kokomo facility 
our principal assets are located at our primary integrated production facility in kokomo  indiana and at our production facilities in arcadia  louisiana and in mountain home  north carolina 
the arcadia and mountain home plants rely to a significant extent upon feedstock produced at the kokomo facility 
any production failures  shutdowns or other significant problems at the kokomo facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain property damage insurance to provide for reconstruction of damaged equipment  as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production shutdown caused by an insured loss 
although we believe that our insurance is adequate to cover any such losses  that may not be the case 
one or more significant uninsured losses at our kokomo facility may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  from time to time we schedule planned outages on the equipment at our kokomo facility for maintenance and upgrades 
these projects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including a variety of market  operational and labor related factors  many of which may be beyond our control 
should a planned shut down on a significant piece of equipment last substantially longer than originally planned  there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results 
a default under our agreements with titanium metals corporation could require us to make significant payments and could disrupt our operations 
we are party to a conversion services agreement and an access and security agreement with titanium metals corporation timet that provide for the performance of certain titanium conversion services through november timet was acquired by precision castparts corp 
which owns special metals corporation  a direct competitor of ours 
events of default under the conversion services agreement include a a change in control in which the successor does not assume the agreement  b a violation by the company of certain non compete obligations relating to the manufacture and conversion of titanium and c failure to meet agreed upon delivery and quality requirements 
if an event of default under the conversion services agreement occurs  timet could require us to repay the unearned portion of the million fee paid to us by timet when the agreement was signed  plus liquidated damages of million 
our obligations to pay these amounts to timet are secured by a security interest in our four high steckel rolling mill  through which we process a substantial amount of our products 
in addition  the access and security agreement with timet includes  among other terms  an access right that would allow timet to use certain of our operating assets  including the four high mill  to perform titanium conversion services in the event of our bankruptcy or the acceleration of our indebtedness 
exercise by 
table of contents timet of its rights under its security interest following a default and non payment of the amounts provided in the conversion services agreement or exercise of the access rights under the access and security agreement could cause significant disruption in our kokomo operations which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
during periods of lower demand in other alloy markets  some of our competitors may use their available capacity to produce higher volumes of high performance alloys  which leads to increased competition in the high performance alloy market 
we have experienced increased competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys 
due to continued under utilization of capacity in the stainless steel market  we believe these competitors increased their production levels and sales activity in high performance alloys to keep capacity in their mills as full as possible  while offering very competitive prices and delivery times 
if the stainless market does not improve  continued competition from stainless steel producers could negatively impact our average selling price and reduce our gross profit margin 
in addition  as a result of the competition in our markets  we have made significant price concessions to our customers from time to time  and we expect customer pressure for further price concessions to continue 
maintenance of our market share will depend  in part  on our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
if we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing  our profitability will suffer 
our effectiveness in managing our cost structure will be a key determinant of future profitability and competitiveness 
rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel may materially adversely affect our operating results 
to the extent that we are unable to adjust to rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel  there may be a negative effect on our gross profit margins 
in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of our products  accounted for approximately of our raw material costs  or approximately of our total costs of sales 
we enter into several different types of sales contracts with our customers  some of which allow us to pass on increases in nickel prices to our customers 
in other cases  we fix the nickel component of our prices for a period of time through the life of a long term contract 
in yet other cases  we price our products at the time of order  which allows us to establish prices with reference to known costs of our nickel inventory  but which does not allow us to offset an unexpected rise in the price of nickel 
we may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials in the future 
in the event that raw material price increases occur that we are unable to pass on to our customers  our cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
alternatively  our results of operations may also be negatively impacted if both customer demand and nickel prices rapidly fall at the same time 
because we value most of our inventory utilizing the first in  first out inventory costing methodology  a rapid decrease in raw material costs has a negative effect on our operating results 
in those circumstances  we recognize higher material cost in cost of sales relative to lower raw material market prices that drive the sales price 
in addition  we periodically enter into forward purchase agreements for our nickel supply 
if we enter into a forward purchase agreement which is not matched to one or more customer contracts with fixed nickel prices  a rapid or prolonged decrease in the price of nickel could adversely impact our operating results 
our business is dependent on a number of raw materials that are subject to volatility in price and availability 
we use a number of raw materials in our products which are found in only a few parts of the world and are available from a limited number of suppliers 
the availability and costs of these materials may be influenced by private or government cartels  changes in world politics  labor relations between the materials producers and their work force  unstable governments in exporting nations  inflation  general 
table of contents economic conditions and export quotas imposed by governments in nations with rare earth element supplies 
the ability of key material suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements or to provide materials on price and other terms acceptable to us can also impact our ability to meet commitments to customers 
future shortages or price fluctuations in raw materials could result in decreased sales as well as margins  or otherwise adversely affect our business 
the enactment of new or increased import duties on raw materials imported by us could also increase the costs to us of obtaining the raw materials and might adversely affect our business 
if suppliers increase the price of critical raw materials  we may not have alternative sources of supply 
in some cases  we have entered into exclusive supply agreements with respect to raw materials  which could adversely affect our results of operations if the exclusive supplier cannot meet quality and delivery requirements to provide materials on price and other terms acceptable to us 
in addition  to the extent that we have quoted prices to customers and accepted customer orders for products prior to purchasing necessary raw materials  or have existing fixed price contracts  we may be unable to raise the price of products to cover all or part of the increased cost of the raw materials 
the manufacture of some of our products is a complex process and requires long lead times 
as a result  we may experience delays or shortages in the supply of raw materials 
if unable to obtain adequate and timely deliveries of required raw materials  we may be unable to timely manufacture sufficient quantities of products 
this could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs  delay new product introductions or suffer harm to our reputation 
failure to successfully develop  commercialize  market and sell new applications and new products could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our proprietary alloys and metallurgical manufacturing expertise provide us with a competitive advantage over other high performance alloy producers 
our ability to maintain this competitive advantage depends on our ability to continue to offer products that have equal or better performance characteristics than competing products at competitive prices 
our future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to address the increasingly demanding needs of our customers by enhancing the properties of our existing alloys  by timely developing new applications for our existing products  and by timely developing  commercializing  marketing and selling new products 
if we are not successful in these efforts  or if our new products and product enhancements do not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  our revenues  cash flows and results of operations could be negatively affected 
we are subject to risks relating to our cybersecurity measures 
we have put in place a number of systems  processes and practices designed to protect against intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information or disruption of our operations 
these include  for example  the appropriate encryption of information 
despite such efforts  we are subject to breaches of security systems which may result in unauthorized access  misappropriation  corruption or disruption of the information we are trying to protect  in which case we could suffer material harm 
access to our proprietary information regarding new alloy formulations would allow our competitors to use that information in the development of competing products 
current employees have  and former employees may have  access to a significant amount of information regarding our operations which could be disclosed to our competitors or otherwise used to harm us 
in addition  our systems could be subject to sabotage by employees or third parties  which could slow or stop production or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
any misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information or disruption of our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents an interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns 
we rely upon third parties for our supply of energy resources consumed in the manufacture of our products 
the prices for and availability of electricity  natural gas  oil and other energy resources are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by political and economic factors beyond our control 
disruptions in the supply of energy resources could temporarily impair our ability to manufacture products for customers 
further  increases in energy costs  or changes in costs relative to energy costs paid by competitors  has and may continue to adversely affect our profitability 
to the extent that these uncertainties cause suppliers and customers to be more cost sensitive  increased energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be adversely affected by environmental  health and safety laws  regulations  costs and other liabilities 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment  the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the health and safety of our employees 
under these laws and regulations  we may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances on  under or from any of our current or former properties or any off site location to which we sent or arranged to be sent wastes for disposal or treatment  and such costs may be material 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other hazardous substances that may be attributable to our products or other environmental damage 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment 
violations of these laws  regulations or permits can also result in the imposition of substantial penalties  permit revocations and or facility shutdowns 
we have received permits from the environmental regulatory authorities in indiana and north carolina to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas of our kokomo and mountain home facilities that were used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
we are required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  we are aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action could be required 
additionally  it is possible that we could be required to undertake other corrective action for any other solid waste management unit or other conditions existing or determined to exist at our facilities 
we are unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action  if required 
however  the costs of future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
our operations generate hazardous substances  many of which we accumulate at our facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site or recycling by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to liability under cercla and state counterparts 
in addition  we may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at sites which are subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at two sites 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault 
if we are named as a potentially responsible party at other sites in the future  the costs associated with those future sites could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental laws  changes in any environmental law may increase our costs of compliance and liabilities arising from any past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances and may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business environmental matters 
pending legislation or regulation of greenhouse gases  if enacted or adopted in an onerous form  could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
political and scientific debates related to the impacts of emissions of greenhouse gases on the global climate are prevalent 
regulation or some form of legislation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions is currently being considered in the united states as well as globally 
as a high performance alloy manufacturer  we will be affected  both directly and indirectly  if proposed climate change legislation  such as use of a cap and trade system  is enacted which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are subject to increasing levels of federal regulation 
in recent years  the united states congress has adopted several significant pieces of legislation that affect our operations 
we may be subject to significant fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these laws or their implementing regulations  and the increasingly stringent regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures 
any such fines  penalties or expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
new regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business 
the sec has promulgated final rules mandated by the dodd frank act regarding disclosure of the use of tin  tantalum  tungsten and gold  known as conflict minerals  in products manufactured by public companies 
these new rules require due diligence to determine whether such minerals originated from the democratic republic of congo the drc or an adjoining country and whether such minerals helped finance the armed conflict in the drc 
the first conflict minerals report required by the new rules is due by may  and annually thereafter 
there will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements  including costs to determine the origin of conflict minerals used in our products 
in addition  the implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing  supply and pricing of materials used in our products 
also  we may face disqualification as a supplier for customers and reputational challenges if the due diligence procedures we implement do not enable us to verify the origins for all conflict minerals or to determine that such minerals are drc conflict free 
our business is affected by federal rules  regulations and orders applicable to government contractors 
a number of our products are manufactured and sold under us government contracts or subcontracts 
consequently  we are directly and indirectly subject to various federal rules  regulations and orders applicable to government contractors 
from time to time  we are also subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business practices due to our participation in government programs 
these inquiries and investigations are costly and consuming of internal resources 
violations of applicable government rules and regulations could result in civil liability  in cancellation or suspension of existing contracts or in ineligibility for future contracts or subcontracts funded in whole or in part with federal funds  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we could be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 
our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension benefits incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  retirement age and mortality 
we currently expect that we will be required to make future minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
a decline in the value of plan investments in the future  an increase in costs or liabilities or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
a requirement to fund any deficit created in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel  our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees who may terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any of our senior management team could harm our business 
the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
we face challenges in hiring  training  managing and retaining employees in certain areas including metallurgical researchers  equipment technicians  and sales and marketing staff 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled employees  our new product and alloy development and commercialization could be delayed and our marketing and sales efforts could be hindered  which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results 
the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from operations in international markets 
as we continue to expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel for our direct sales efforts and retain distributors and train their personnel in countries where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
distributors  regulators or other government agencies may not continue to accept our products  services and business practices 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on the international market 
the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of raw materials from international sources  subject us to the trade regulations of various jurisdictions 
compliance with such regulations is costly 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities 
failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping  sales and service activities 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions any one or more of which may adversely affect our business and financial results  including our ability to obtain  and the costs associated with obtaining  us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in duties and tariffs  taxes  trade restrictions  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  burdens of complying with the foreign corrupt practices act and a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  
table of contents business practices or laws favoring local companies  fluctuations in foreign currencies  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  longer payment cycles and difficulties collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending agreements and intellectual property rights  and foreign political or economic conditions 
any material decrease in our international revenues or inability to expand our international operations as a result of these or other factors would adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
although a collective bargaining agreement is in place for certain employees  union or labor disputes could still disrupt the manufacturing process 
our operations rely heavily on our skilled employees 
any labor shortage  disruption or stoppage caused by any deterioration in employee relations or difficulties in the renegotiation of labor contracts could reduce our operating margins and income 
approximately percent of our us employees are affiliated with unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in fiscal the company entered into new collective bargaining agreements with the united steel workers of america which covers eligible hourly employees at the company arcadia  louisiana  kokomo  indiana and lebanon  indiana facilities 
failure to negotiate new labor agreements when required could result in a work stoppage at one or more of our facilities 
although we believe that our labor relations have generally been satisfactory  it is possible that we could become subject to additional work rules imposed by agreements with labor unions  or that work stoppages or other labor disturbances could occur in the future  any of which could reduce our operating margins and income and place us at a disadvantage relative to non union competitors 
product liability and product warranty risks could adversely affect our operating results 
we produce many critical products for commercial and military aircraft and for land based gas turbines 
failure of our products could give rise to substantial product liability and other damage claims 
we maintain insurance addressing this risk  but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  we manufacture our products to strict contractually established specifications using complex manufacturing processes 
if we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a part  we may be subject to warranty costs to repair or replace the product itself and additional costs related to the investigation and inspection of non complying products 
these costs are generally not insured 
our business subjects us to risk of litigation claims  as a routine matter  and this risk increases the potential for a loss that might not be covered by insurance 
litigation claims may relate to the conduct of our business  including claims pertaining to product liability  commercial disputes  employment actions  employee benefits  compliance with domestic and federal laws and personal injury 
due to the uncertainties of litigation  we might not prevail on claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face and additional claims may be made against us in the future 
the outcome of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty  and some of these lawsuits  claims or proceedings may be determined adversely to us 
the resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations for that period 

table of contents we depend on our information technology it infrastructure to support the current and future information requirements of our operations 
management relies on it infrastructure  including hardware  network  software  people and process  to provide useful information to support assessments and conclusions about operating performance 
we are in the process of implementing an it system change 
if we do not successfully or timely implement the new system or it does not operate as envisioned  our business could be harmed 
our inability to produce relevant or reliable measures of operating performance in an efficient  cost effective and well controlled fashion may have significant negative impacts on our future operations 
any significant delay or problems in the expansion of our operations could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are in the process of undertaking significant capital projects in order to enhance  expand and or upgrade our facilities and operational capabilities 
our ability to achieve the anticipated increased revenues or otherwise realize acceptable returns on these investments or other strategic capital projects that we may undertake is subject to a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control  including the ability of management to ensure the necessary resources are in place to properly execute these projects on time and in accordance with planned costs  the ability of key suppliers to deliver the necessary equipment according to schedule and our ability to implement these project with minimal impacts to our existing operations 
in addition  the cost to implement any given strategic capital project ultimately may prove to be greater than originally anticipated 
if we are not able to achieve the anticipated results from the implementation of any of our strategic capital projects  or if we incur unanticipated implementation costs or delays  our results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected 
a global recession or disruption in global financial markets could adversely affect us 
a global recession or disruption in the global financial markets presents risks and uncertainties that we cannot predict 
during the recent recession  we saw a decline in demand for our products due to global economic conditions 
during recessionary economic conditions or financial market disruptions  we face risks that may include declines in revenues and profitability from reduced or delayed orders by our customers  supply problems associated with any financial constraints faced by our suppliers  restrictions on our access to credit sources  reductions to our banking group or to our committed credit availability due to combinations or failures of financial institutions  and increases in corporate tax rates to finance government spending programs 
risks related to shares of our common stock our stock price is subject to fluctuations as a result of being traded on a public exchange which may not be related to our performance 
the stock market can be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed elsewhere in this risk factors section and others such as fluctuations in the market price of nickel  raw materials or energy  
table of contents market conditions in the end markets into which our customers sell their products  principally aerospace  power generation and chemical processing  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  announcements by us of acquisitions  alliances  joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the high temperature resistant alloy and corrosion resistant alloy markets  market conditions in the technology  manufacturing or other growth sectors  and rumors relating to us or our competitors 
payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance 
although our board of directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock  the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the board assessment of our operations  financial condition  projected liabilities  our compliance with contractual restrictions in our credit agreement  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as delaware statutes  may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions  including those regulating the nomination of directors  may make it more difficult for other persons  without the approval of our board of directors  to launch takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

aerospace sales for fiscal decreased from fiscal  which was the company best year for aerospace sales volume 
throughout fiscal  aerospace demand was negatively impacted by customer destocking within the supply chain and by falling raw material market prices which caused customers to delay ordering 
this period of low demand is considered temporary  but is expected to persist through the early portion of fiscal demand for aerospace products is expected to begin to increase commensurate with the forecasted increase in commercial aircraft builds 
both boeing and airbus have reported sizeable backlog increases along with forecasted increases in production schedules and continued emphasis on accelerating production 
demand for more fuel efficient engines with fewer emissions is driving new engine builds 
management also anticipates that the maintenance  repair and overhaul business will continue at a steady to increasing pace due to required maintenance schedules for the rising number of engines in use year over year 
sales to the chemical processing industry decreased year over year 
the project oriented nature of this market can create inconsistent sales levels 
demand for large project based orders has been at relatively low levels during fiscal and the main driver of demand in this market is capital expenditure spending in the chemical processing sector driven by end user demand for housing  automotive and agricultural products 
the chemical processing market is sensitive to fiscal policies as well as world economic conditions and gdp growth 
increased sales to the chemical processing industry in fiscal will be dependent on improvement in global spending in the chemical processing sector 
an additional driver of demand in this market is the increase in north american production of natural gas liquids and the further downstream processing of those chemicals that may utilize equipment that requires high performance alloys 

table of contents sales to the land based gas turbine market in fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  which was the company best year for land based gas turbine sales volume 
subject to global economic conditions  management believes that long term demand in this market will improve due to higher activity in power generation  oil and gas production and alternative power systems 
land based gas turbines are favored in electric generating facilities due to low capital cost at installation  fewer emissions than the traditional fossil fuel fired facilities and favorable domestic natural gas prices provided by availability of unconventional shale gas supplies 
as governmental policy shifts away from coal fired facilities  demand for land based gas turbines is expected to increase 
sales into the other markets category decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal partly due to a shipment of an oil and gas project order in fiscal which did not repeat in fiscal the industries in this category focus on upgrading overall quality  improving product performance through increased efficiency  prolonging product life and lowering long term costs 
companies in these industries are looking to achieve these goals through the use of advanced materials which supports the increased use of high performance alloys in an expanding number of applications 
in addition to supporting and expanding the traditional businesses of oil and gas  flue gas desulphurization  automotive and heat treating  the company expects increased levels of activity overall in non traditional markets such as fuel cells and silicon feed stock production applications 
summary of capital spending in fiscal  the company began to increase the amount of capital spending from historical levels in order to increase capacity commensurate with the anticipated expansion of the markets the company services over the intermediate and long term and also to improve customer service in the form of accelerated delivery times and expanded value added products and services 
even though the markets in which the company participates are currently experiencing a period of lower demand  management continues to believe in the long term growth potential of the aerospace  land based gas turbine and chemical processing markets 
therefore  the company is continuing to implement its strategy regarding the previously announced capital investment projects in line with plans to meet the expected long term growth requirements of those target markets 
in fiscal  the company announced plans to invest approximately million at two of its us manufacturing facilities 
this includes plans to invest approximately million to expand by an estimated the specialty titanium and high performance nickel alloy tubular production capacity of its arcadia  louisiana facility 
in addition  the company plans to invest approximately million to expand by an estimated its capacity to produce specialty high performance alloy flat products at the company kokomo  indiana facility 
both of these projects have commenced  and are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal these capital investments in arcadia and kokomo are expected to improve the company ability to service its customers increasing demand for specialty products and also continue to improve product quality  improve operating efficiencies and enhance working capital management for all of the company products produced at these locations 
the company also previously announced plans to upgrade the company information systems so that all the company locations will be on a global centralized information technology system 
to date  the company has spent million and expects to spend approximately million in fiscal for a total project spend of approximately million 
the system is currently in use at the european service centers while the company expects the domestic services centers to be completed during the second quarter of fiscal the systems upgrade for the manufacturing operating system is expected to be completed during the third quarter of fiscal in addition to enhanced analysis capability  the company expects this system to lead to improvements in capacity planning  cost analysis and reduction  inventory management and customer service 

table of contents the company evaluation of its global service center and distribution function continues 
the evaluation has included an analysis of the equipment required  the number and geographic locations of these service centers  the services provided and the cost structure  with the objective of enhancing the distribution organization 
the company is pursuing the purchase of coil processing capability with stretch leveling and cut to length capability 
the enhanced capabilities are expected to result in increased revenue  enhancement of working capital management and a reduced cost structure  which is expected to improve return on assets at the service centers 
spending on the service and distribution center projects is estimated at approximately million throughout fiscal and and includes additional cutting equipment such as laser and water jet cutting equipment 
capital spending in fiscal was million 
the forecast for capital spending in fiscal is approximately million 
the million of planned capital spending includes million for the tubular capacity expansion  million for the processing and service center upgrades  million for the kokomo flat product project  million for the information systems upgrade project and the remaining million for additional enhancements and upgrades of the current facilities and equipment 
the processing and service center project capital spend are expected to carry over into fiscal with approximately million of spend in that year 
the actual and planned capital investments of approximately million over the three year period of fiscal through are expected to allow the company to increase capacity  enhance product quality  reduce costs and improve working capital management 
these significant investments are necessitated by expected intermediate and long term increasing customer demand for volume and quality improvements 
dividends declared on november   the company announced that the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of per outstanding share of the company common stock 
the dividend is payable december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the aggregate cash payout based on current shares outstanding will be approximately million  or approximately million on an annualized basis 
gross profit margin trend performance the following tables show net revenue  gross profit margin and gross profit margin percentage for fiscal and fiscal trend of gross profit margin and gross profit margin percentage for fiscal quarter ended dollars in thousands december  march  june  september  net revenues gross profit margin gross profit margin trend of gross profit margin and gross profit margin percentage for fiscal quarter ended dollars in thousands december  march  june  september  net revenues gross profit margin gross profit margin 
table of contents the gross profit margin percentage decreased during each quarter of fiscal the quarter to quarter compression is primarily due to lower average selling prices resulting from price competition in the marketplace and the impact of declining raw material prices on demand as well as higher cost inventory charged to cost of goods sold 
gross profit margin and gross profit margin percentage for fiscal were also impacted by the effect of a fixed pricing agreement with the company nickel supplier pursuant to which the company agreed to purchase a portion of its nickel supply at a fixed price that has been and may continue to be greater than the market price of nickel 
the impact of the contract on the company gross profit margin percentage for the fiscal year was percentage points 
while not material to the fiscal year results  the contract had a greater impact as the market price of nickel continued to drop through the second half of fiscal in the fourth quarter  the company entered into an amendment with the supplier that allowed the company to purchase lower volumes of the higher priced nickel but extended the duration of the purchase commitment through fiscal in order to minimize the near term impact and provide a longer period in which the market price of nickel could increase 
if the market price of nickel remains low and sales volumes do not increase  the impact on the company gross profit margin percentage is expected to be unfavorable in future periods as a result of the fixed price contract  which impact is estimated at approximately percentage point  or higher  if the market price of nickel declines further 
volumes  competition and pricing the company continues to experience reduced demand  reduced selling price due to nickel market prices and increased price competition in the marketplace relative to fiscal  particularly in commodity type alloys in mill direct project business 
the intense competitive environment continues to require the company to aggressively price orders across all markets  which has unfavorably impacted the company gross profit margin and net income 
in addition  sales volumes below mill capacities in the industry have reduced mill direct lead times for our products 
the decline in mill direct lead times has  in turn  resulted in downward pressure on prices for service center transactional business  which typically commands a higher price due to faster product availability 
in addition to the negative effects of price competition  volumes in fiscal are lower than those in fiscal management believes the reduction in volume in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets is attributable to destocking in the supply chain as customers consume excess inventory 
volume reductions in the chemical processing market are primarily attributable to lower large project releases 
the year to year reduction in volume in the other markets is due to a large tubular oil and gas project produced and shipped in fiscal that did not repeat in fiscal management believes the decline in the price of nickel and customer uncertainty regarding the strength of the economy have also been contributors to the decline in overall volumes 
declining nickel prices can cause customers to delay orders for the company products because the company generally passes the cost of nickel on to customers in the price of its products 
as nickel prices decline  customers may delay ordering in order to receive a lower price in the future 
the reduced volumes processed through the mill have resulted in reduced absorption of fixed costs and additional margin compression 
the company has implemented cost reduction measures and continues to carefully review discretionary spending in order to mitigate the impact of these factors on gross margin 
the company values inventory utilizing the first in  first out fifo inventory costing methodology 
under the fifo inventory costing method  the cost of materials included in cost of sales may be different than the current market price at the time of sale of finished product due to the length of time from the acquisition of the raw material to the sale of the finished product 
in a period of decreasing raw material costs  the fifo inventory valuation normally results in higher costs of sales as compared to the last in  first out method 
conversely  in a period of rising raw material costs  the fifo inventory valuation normally results in lower costs of sales 

table of contents working capital controllable working capital  which includes accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and accrued expenses  was million at september   a decrease of million or from million at september  this decrease of million includes a reduction of inventory of million due to careful attention to reducing melting and production schedules to match customer demand 
guidance first quarter results are typically impacted by lower production days due to holidays and planned maintenance outages 
planned outages related to the capital expansion projects in both kokomo and arcadia as well as other extended maintenance related projects are expected to impact first quarter results 
in addition  the company has continued to see order entry  pricing and backlog decline with lower demand  which resulted in managing inventories down 
the company remains committed to preparing for the anticipated long term growth opportunities in its core markets 
however  in the short term  management expects revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to be lower than revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal and  the company expects to incur a net loss in the first quarter of fiscal backlog set forth below is selected data relating to the company backlog  the day average nickel price per pound as reported by the london metals exchange  as well as a breakdown of net revenues  shipments and average selling prices to the markets served by the company for the periods shown 
these data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the remainder of the management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report on form k 
quarter ended quarter ended december  march  june  september  december  march  june  september  backlog dollars in thousands pounds in thousands average selling price per pound average nickel price per pound london metals exchange represents the average price for a cash buyer as reported by the london metals exchange for the days ending on the last day of the period presented 
backlog was million at september   a decrease of approximately million  or  from million at june  on a year to date basis  the backlog has declined by million or primarily due to a million pound reduction in backlog pounds 
the reduction in the backlog during the fiscal year resulted from reduced order entry activity  as compared to sales  in each quarter of fiscal backlog for aerospace  land based gas turbine and other markets declined in fiscal backlog for the chemical processing market remained flat at a low level 
management believes that destocking continues in the supply chain causing lower order entry volumes 
management also believes that customers continue to exercise caution in making purchases due to the decreasing cost of nickel 
the effect of these factors was greater in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets than in its other markets in fiscal the company pounds shipped to the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets in fiscal represented a record level of shipments

table of contents inflation or deflation while neither inflation nor deflation has had  nor does the company expect them to have  a material impact on operating results  there can be no assurance that the company business will not be affected by inflation or deflation in the future 
historically  the company has had the ability to pass on to customers both increases in consumable costs and material costs because of the value added contribution the material makes to the final product 
raw material comprises the most significant portion of the product costs 
nickel  cobalt and molybdenum  the primary raw materials used to manufacture the company products  all have experienced significant fluctuations in price 
in the future  the company may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials 
in the event of raw material price declines the company customers may delay order patterns resulting in lower volumes 
in the event that raw material price increases occur that the company is unable to pass on to its customers  its cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates overview management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  asset impairments  retirement benefits  matters related to product liability lawsuits and environmental matters 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  pension asset mix and  in some cases  actuarial techniques  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company routinely reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company accounting policies are more fully described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
the following listing of policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment fob shipping point or at a foreign port for certain export customers 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a component of net revenues in the periods in which the related sales are recognized 
management determines this allowance based on historical experience 
should returns increase above historical experience  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  the company recognizes revenue attributable to an up front fee received from titanium metals corporation timet as a result of a twenty year agreement  entered into on november   
table of contents to provide conversion services to timet 
see note deferred revenue for a description of accounting treatment relating to this up front fee 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering most of its current and former employees 
significant elements in determining the assets or liabilities and related income or expense for these plans are the expected return on plan assets if any  the discount rate used to value future payment streams  expected trends in health care costs  and other actuarial assumptions 
annually  the company evaluates the significant assumptions to be used to value its pension and postretirement plan assets and liabilities based on current market conditions and expectations of future costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required in future periods 
the selection of the plan assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the plan target allocation of equities and bonds  and the expected rate of return for each equity bond asset class 
based upon the target allocation and each asset class expected return  the plan return on assets assumption of is reasonable  and is unchanged from last year assumption 
the company also realizes that historical performance is no guarantee of future performance 
in the short term  substantial decreases in plan assets will result in higher plan funding contribution levels and higher pension expenses 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase in annual pension expense of about  to the extent that the actual return on plan assets during the year exceeds or falls short of the assumed long term rate of return  an asset gain or loss is created 
gains and losses are generally amortized over a year period 
as an example  each million in asset loss created by unfavorable investment performance results in seven annual payments contributions of approximately  depending upon the precise effective interest rate in the valuation and the timing of the contribution 
decreases in discount rates used to value future payment streams will result in higher liabilities for pension and postretirement plans 
a decrease of basis points would result in million higher liability for the us pension plan and million higher liability for the postretirement plan 
this increase in liability would also increase the accumulated other comprehensive loss that would be amortized as higher pension and postretirement expense over an amortization period of approximately and years  respectively 
salaried employees hired after december  and hourly employees hired after june  are not covered by the pension plan  however  they are eligible for an enhanced matching program of the defined contribution plan k 
effective december   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for all non union employees in the us effective september   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for employees in the plan 
impairment of long lived assets and other intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company reviews for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicated that the carrying amount may be impaired 

table of contents share based compensation restricted stock plan on february   the company adopted a restricted stock plan that reserved  shares of common stock for issuance 
grants of restricted stock are grants of shares of the company common stock subject to transfer restrictions  which vest in accordance with the terms and conditions established by the compensation committee 
the compensation committee may set vesting requirements based on the achievement of specific performance goals or the passage of time 
restricted shares are subject to forfeiture if employment or service terminates prior to the vesting period or if the performance goal is not met 
the company will assess  on an ongoing basis  the probability of whether the performance criteria will be achieved 
the company will recognize compensation expense over the performance period if it is deemed probable that the goal will be achieved 
the fair value of the company restricted stock is determined based upon the closing price of the company common stock on the grant date 
the plan provides for the adjustment of the number of shares covered by an outstanding grant and the maximum number of shares for which restricted stock may be granted in the event of a stock split  extraordinary dividend or distribution or similar recapitalization event 
stock option plans the company has two stock option plans that authorize the granting of non qualified stock options to certain key employees and non employee directors for the purchase of a maximum of  shares of the company common stock 
the original option plan was adopted in august pursuant to the plan of reorganization and provides for the grant of options to purchase up to  shares of the company common stock 
in january  the company board of directors adopted a second option plan that provides for options to purchase up to  shares of the company common stock 
each plan provides for the adjustment of the maximum number of shares for which options may be granted in the event of a stock split  extraordinary dividend or distribution or similar recapitalization event 
unless the compensation committee determines otherwise  options granted under the option plans are exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of grant and vest per year over three years from the grant date

the fair value of the option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions on dividend yield  risk free interest rate  expected volatilities  expected forfeiture rate and expected lives of the options 
income taxes the company accounts for deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is required if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is needed is based upon an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence 
in its evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  the company assesses prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in enacted tax laws and the availability of future taxable income 
on october   the company adopted guidance prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
it also provides guidance related to reversal of tax positions  balance sheet classification  interest and penalties  interim period accounting  disclosure and transition

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the price of raw material particularly nickel 
changes in interest rates affect the company interest expense on variable rate debt 
all of the company revolver availability is at a variable rate at september  and the company outstanding variable rate debt was zero at september  and the company has not entered into any derivative instruments to hedge the effects of changes in interest rates 
the foreign currency exchange risk exists primarily because the foreign subsidiaries maintain receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
the foreign subsidiaries manage their own foreign currency exchange risk 
the us operations transact their foreign sales in us dollars  thereby avoiding fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
any exposure aggregating more than  requires approval from the company vice president of finance 
the company is not currently party to any currency contracts 
fluctuations in the price of nickel  the company most significant raw material  subject the company to commodity price risk 
the company manages its exposure to this market risk through internally established policies and procedures  including negotiating raw material escalators within product sales agreements and continually monitoring and revising customer quote amounts to reflect the fluctuations in market prices for nickel 
the company does not presently use derivative instruments to manage this market risk but may in the future 
the company monitors its underlying market risk exposure from a rapid change in nickel prices on an ongoing basis and believes that it can modify or adapt its strategies as necessary 
the company periodically purchases raw material forward with certain suppliers 
however  there is a risk that the company may not be able to successfully offset a rapid increase or decrease in the cost of raw material in the future
