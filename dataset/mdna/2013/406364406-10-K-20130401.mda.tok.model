hallwood financial proposal 
on november   the company received a proposal from hallwood financial to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of the company that it does not beneficially own at a cash purchase price of per share 
hallwood financial  a private limited company organized under the laws of the british virgin islands  is controlled by the company s chief executive officer and members of his family 
hallwood financial owns  or  of the outstanding shares of the company 
on november  at the company s regularly scheduled board of directors meeting  a special committee  consisting of its independent directors  was formed to consider and negotiate the proposal and to make a recommendation to the full board of directors 
the special committee is empowered to retain its own independent legal and financial advisors to assist in its review and negotiation of the proposed transaction 
the company s shares trade on the nyse mkt stock exchange under the symbol of hwg and closed on november  the day prior to the receipt of the offer at per share 
the company s shares closed on march  at per share 
in november  the special committee retained its own independent legal representation 
in december  the special committee interviewed financial advisors and reviewed subsequent additional written presentations  and in january  the special committee selected and engaged a financial advisor to assist in the review of the proposed transaction 
the board of directors cautions the company s shareholders and others considering trading in its securities that it has only received the proposal and that no decision has been made with respect to the company s response to the proposal 
there can be no assurance that any offer will be accepted  that any agreement will be executed or that the transaction contemplated in the proposal or any other transaction will be approved or consummated 
the company does not anticipate making any further public statements about this matter or the activities of the special committee unless and until either it enters into a definitive agreement for a transaction or the special committee determines that no such transaction will be effected 
textile products 
in the three years ended december   the company derived all of its operating revenues from the textile activities of its brookwood subsidiary  consequently  the company s success is highly dependent upon brookwood s success 
brookwood s success will be influenced in varying degrees by its ability to continue sales to existing customers  costs  availability of supplies  its response to competition and its ability to generate new markets and products 

table of contents while brookwood has enjoyed substantial revenues from its military business  there is no assurance that such revenues will continue 
brookwood s sales to the customers from whom it derives its military business have been volatile and difficult to predict  a trend management believes will continue 
in recent years  orders from the military for goods generally were significantly affected by the activity of the us military 
if this activity changes  then orders from the military generally  including orders for brookwood s products  may be similarly affected 
military sales were   and  in  and  respectively  which represented  and of brookwood s sales 
military sales were lower in and lower in from the respective previous years 
from time to time  the military limits orders for existing products and adopts revised specifications for new products to replace the products for which brookwood s customers have been suppliers 
the us government released orders in recent years that include brookwood s products  which resulted in significant military sales 
changes in specifications  procurement entity budgets  or orders present a potential opportunity for additional sales  however  it is a continuing challenge to adjust to changing specifications  budgetary and production requirements 
brookwood has regularly conducted research and development on various processes and products intended to comply with the revised specifications and it participates in the bidding process for new military products 
however  to the extent brookwood s products are not included in future purchases by the us government for any reason  brookwood s sales could be adversely affected 
a provision of us federal law  known as the berry amendment  generally requires the department of defense to give preference in procurement to domestically produced products  including textiles 
brookwood s sales of products to the us military market are highly dependent upon the continuing application and enforcement of the berry amendment by the us government 
in addition  the us government is releasing contracts for shorter periods than in the past 
management acknowledges the unpredictability in revenues and margins due to military sales and is unable at this time to predict future sales trends 
unstable global nylon and chemical pricing and volatile domestic energy costs  coupled with a varying product mix  have continued to cause fluctuations in brookwood s margins  a trend that will potentially continue 
brookwood continues to identify new market niches 
in addition to its existing products and proprietary technologies  brookwood has developed advanced breathable  waterproof laminate and other materials  which have been well received by its customers 
continued development of these fabrics for military  industrial and consumer applications is a key element of brookwood s business plan 
the ongoing success of brookwood is contingent on its ability to maintain its level of military business and adapt to the global textile industry 
there can be no assurance that the positive results of the past can be sustained or that competitors will not aggressively seek to replace products developed by brookwood 
the textile products business is not interdependent with the company s other business operations  if any 
the company does not guarantee the brookwood bank facility and is not obligated to contribute additional capital 
conversely  brookwood does not guarantee debts of the company or any of the company s other subsidiaries and is not obligated to contribute additional capital to the company beyond dividend payments and the tax sharing agreement 
in march  kenyon was affected by the general flooding that took place in the state of rhode island and in particular from the pawcatuck river 
kenyon was closed for a period of seven days after which it reinstituted production of unaffected production lines 
only certain production lines were affected and production capacity was restored within a few weeks 
brookwood filed claims with its insurance carriers  through its kenyon subsidiary 
brookwood recognized the  insurance policy deductible in the second quarter and has received from its carriers  for its building and contents claims  including  received in brookwood also filed a claim under its business interruption insurance policy and received  in july from its carrier in satisfaction of its claims  which was recognized as a recovery in the second quarter 
no additional amounts are due 

table of contents in may  brookwood laminating completed the purchase of its connecticut production facility pursuant to the exercise of an option contained in its lease agreement 
the purchase price of  was funded with operating cash flows 
investments in financial instruments 
in the first quarter of  the company opened an investment account with ubs ag  a global financial services firm and intended to transfer a significant portion of the cash it holds from time to time to the ubs account to be placed in various financial instruments and to borrow additional amounts from ubs to invest on a leveraged basis 
as of march   no funds have been transferred into the ubs account and currently the company does not intend to transfer funds into the ubs account 
energy 
for a discussion of the company s former energy activities  including the bankruptcy case  refer to the section of this form k entitled investments in hallwood energy  which appears later in this item critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the sec requested that registrants identify critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of their forms k 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of an entity s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following of its accounting policies fit this description revenue recognition 
textile products sales are recognized upon shipment or release of product  when title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
brookwood provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of brookwood s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
brookwood may receive instructions from some of its customers to finish fabric  invoice the full amount and hold the finished inventory for delivery at a later date 
in those cases  brookwood records the sale and sends the customer an invoice containing normal and usual payment terms and identifies the inventory as separate from brookwood s inventory 
generally  a customer provides such instructions to accommodate its lack of available storage space for inventory 
this practice is customary in the textile industry and with respect to certain brookwood customers 
in these cases  the brookwood customer either dictates delivery dates at the time the order is placed or when the customer has not specified a fixed delivery date  the customer owns the goods and has asked brookwood to keep them in its warehouse 
for all of its bill and hold sales  brookwood has no future obligations  the customer is billed when the product is ready for shipment and expected to pay under standard billing and credit terms  regardless of the actual delivery date  and the inventory is identified and unavailable for brookwood s use 
the gross margins on the bill and hold sales held by brookwood at the end of each of the three years ended december  were not material 
deferred income tax asset 
a deferred income tax asset is recognized for net operating loss and certain other tax carryforwards  tax credits and temporary differences  reduced by a valuation allowance  which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the asset will not be realized 
management is required to estimate taxable income for future years and to use its judgment to determine whether or not to record a valuation allowance to reduce part or all of a deferred tax asset 
management considers various tax planning strategies  anticipated gains from the potential sale of investments and projected future income from operations to determine the valuation allowance to be recorded  if any 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
management reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions could negatively affect the fair value of long lived asset and result in an impairment charge 
in the event such indicators exist for long lived asset held for use  if undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than carrying value  the long lived asset is written down to estimated fair value 
for assets held for sale  these assets are carried at the lower of cost or estimated sales price less costs of sale 
fair value is the amount at which the long lived asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties and may be estimated using a number of techniques  including quoted market prices or valuations by third parties  present value techniques based on estimates of cash flows  or multiples of earnings or revenue performance measures 
the fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques 
significant assumptions used in this process depend upon the nature of the long lived asset  but would include an evaluation of the future business opportunities  sources of competition  advancement of technology and its impact on patents and processes and the level of expected operating expenses 
inventories 
inventories at the brookwood subsidiary are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or specific identification method or market 
inventories are reviewed and adjusted for changes in market value based on assumptions related to past and future demand and overall market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions vary from those projected by management  adjustments to lower of cost or market value may be required 
inventory levels  usage and age are evaluated and inventories are adjusted to net realizable value on a quarterly basis 
contingencies 
from time to time  the company  its subsidiaries  certain of its affiliates and others have been named as defendants in lawsuits relating to various transactions in which it or its affiliated entities participated 
the company accrues for losses associated with contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment may be required in the determination of both probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
management s estimates are subjective based on the status of the legal proceeding  the merit of the defenses and consultation with legal counsel 
in certain matters  it is not possible to determine whether a liability has been incurred or to estimate the ultimate or minimum amount of that liability until the matter is close to resolution 
as additional information becomes available  management reassesses the potential liability  if any  related to pending claims and may revise its estimates 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the legal process  estimates may be materially different than the actual outcomes  with the result that hallwood group s financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
the critical accounting policies listed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of hallwood group s accounting policies 
in most cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in the application of such accounting treatment 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result than those recorded and reported 
presentation the following discussion of hallwood group s financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide information that will assist in understanding its financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect its financial statements
