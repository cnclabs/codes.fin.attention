item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item of this annual report on form k  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
industry overview the municipal solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the municipal solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused municipal solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable operators within the municipal solid waste industry are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste  which is bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
the e p waste services industry is similarly regional in nature and is also highly fragmented  with acquisition opportunities available in several active basins 
competition for e p waste comes primarily from smaller regional companies that utilize a variety of disposal methods and generally serve specific geographic markets 
in addition  customers in many markets have the option of using internal disposal methods or outsourcing to another third party disposal company 
the principal competitive factors in this business include gaining customer approval of treatment and disposal facilities  location of facilities in relation to customer activity  reputation  reliability of services  track record of environmental compliance  ability to accept multiple waste types at a single facility  and price 
executive overview we are an integrated municipal solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services primarily in exclusive and secondary markets in the us and a leading provider of non hazardous exploration and production  or e p  waste treatment  recovery and disposal services in several of the most active natural resource producing areas of the us we also provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the pacific northwest through a network of intermodal facilities 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and instead target markets where we can attain high market share either through exclusive contracts  vertical integration or asset positioning 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
we also target niche markets  like e p waste treatment and disposal services  with similar characteristics and  we believe  higher comparative growth potential 
as of december   we served residential  commercial  industrial and e p customers from a network of operations in states alabama  alaska  arizona  california  colorado  idaho  illinois  iowa  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  massachusetts  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  montana  nebraska  nevada  new mexico  new york  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  oregon  south carolina  south dakota  tennessee  texas  utah  washington and wyoming 
as of december   we owned or operated a network of solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  seven intermodal facilities  recycling operations  active msw  e p and or non msw landfills  e p liquid waste injection wells  e p waste treatment and recovery facilities and oil recovery facilities 

table of contents financial performance operating results revenues in increased to billion from billion in  primarily as a result of acquisitions 
decreased volumes and recycled commodity values offset internal growth from price increases 
we expect acquisitions completed in the year to provide opportunities for future growth both in new markets such as alaska and minnesota s twin cities region  and in niche waste segments such as e p waste 
as shown in the table below  internal growth decreased to negative in  from in pricing growth was percentage points lower than in  due to lower surcharges partially offset by a slight increase in core pricing 
decreases in landfill volumes  driven primarily by our decision to forego low priced tonnage from one large hauler at one of our large landfills  decreased commercial hauling revenue due to declines in container sizes and service frequencies for our existing customers  and a reduction in customer counts due to competition in certain markets contributed to total volume growth decreasing to negative in from negative in intermodal  recycling and other contributed negative to internal growth in  compared to realized in  due primarily to decreases in recycled commodity prices from record levels in the prior year 
price volume intermodal  recycling and other internal growth in  adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to operating income  increased to million  from million in as a percentage of revenue  adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization decreased from in  to in this percentage point decrease was primarily attributable to lower contributions from higher margin revenue components resulting from lower recycled commodity values and disposal volumes  and increased maintenance and repair costs 
adjusted net income attributable to waste connections  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to net income attributable to waste connections  in increased to million from million in adjusted free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  from million in  and capital expenditures increased to million over that period 
adjusted free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities  increased to million in  from million in adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in this decrease as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to increased cash taxes associated with year to year changes in tax deductible timing differences associated with depreciation 
return of capital to stockholders in  we returned million to stockholders through a combination of cash dividends and stock repurchases 
our board of directors declared dividends totaling million throughout  and increased the quarterly cash dividend by from to per share of common stock in october our board of directors intends to review the quarterly dividend during the fourth quarter of each year  with a long term objective of increasing the amount of the dividend 
we also repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at a cost of million during we expect the amount of capital we return to stockholders through stock repurchases to vary depending on our financial condition and results of operations  capital structure  the amount of cash we deploy on acquisitions  the market price of our common stock  and overall market conditions 
we cannot assure you as to the amounts or timing of future stock repurchases or dividends 
we have the ability under our senior revolving credit facility to repurchase our common stock and pay dividends provided we maintain specified financial ratios 
capital position we target a leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility  at approximately x total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
we deployed billion during for acquisitions  which was primarily funded by borrowings during the year  proceeds from a common stock offering and  to a lesser extent  operating cash flow 
as a result  our leverage ratio increased approximately x above our targeted level at year end  but we expect our free cash flow in to reduce this ratio below x by year end  excluding the impact of any additional acquisitions that may close during the year 

table of contents critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company 
such critical accounting estimates and assumptions are applicable to our reportable segments 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
insurance liabilities 
we maintain high deductible insurance policies for automobile  general  employer s  environmental and directors and officers liability as well as for employee group health insurance  property insurance and workers compensation 
we carry umbrella policies for certain types of claims to provide excess coverage over the underlying policies and per incident deductibles 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
if our judgment and estimates concerning assumptions made in calculating our expected future income tax rates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets and liabilities would change 
based on our net deferred tax liability balance at december   each percentage point change to our expected future income tax rate would change our net deferred tax liability balance and income tax expense by approximately million 
accounting for landfills 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and probable expansion airspace 
we calculate the net present value of our final capping  closure and post closure commitments by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows are treated as a new liability and are inflated and discounted at rates reflecting current market conditions 
any changes in expectations that result in a downward revision or no revision to the estimated undiscounted cash flows result in a liability that is inflated and discounted at rates reflecting the market conditions at the time the cash flows were originally estimated 
this policy results in our final capping  closure and post closure liabilities being recorded in layers 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet along with an offsetting addition to site costs  which is amortized to depletion expense as the remaining landfill airspace is consumed 
interest is accreted on the recorded liability using the corresponding discount rate 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells  gas recovery systems and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and five of the six landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to final capping  closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
our discount rate assumption for purposes of computing and layers for final capping  closure and post closure obligations was for each year  which reflects our long term cost of borrowing as of the end of and our inflation rate assumption was for the years ended december  and significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill final capping  closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we own two landfills for which the prior owners are obligated to reimburse us for certain costs we incur for final capping  closure and post closure activities on the portion of the landfill utilized by the prior owners 
we accrue the prior owner s portion of the final capping  closure and post closure obligation within the balance sheet classification of other long term liabilities  and a corresponding receivable from the prior owner in long term other assets 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and probable expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at certain landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
our landfill depletion rate is based on the term of the operating agreement at our operated landfill that has capitalized expenditures 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of an expansion that has not yet been permitted 
expansion airspace that meets the following criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace whether the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own the expansion property or have rights to it under an option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  whether total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  whether internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  whether internal personnel or external consultants are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  and whether we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business or political restrictions or similar issues existing that we believe are more likely than not to impair the success of the expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such cases  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets testing 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our three geographic operating segments and our e p group  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets  including goodwill  assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statements of net income 
in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statements of net income 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole and each indefinite lived intangible asset  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit and the future discrete cash flows related to each indefinite lived intangible asset 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses were based on ten year financial forecasts  which in turn were based on the annual budget developed internally by management 
these forecasts reflect operating profit margins that were consistent with results and perpetual revenue growth rates of 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of our weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 

table of contents in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the segment 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests in and business combination accounting 
we recognize  separately from goodwill  the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values 
we measure and recognize goodwill as of the acquisition date as the excess of a the aggregate of the fair value of consideration transferred  the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree if any and the acquisition date fair value of our previously held equity interest in the acquiree if any  over b the fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
general our revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  recycling and disposal of non hazardous solid waste and treatment  recovery and disposal of non hazardous e p waste 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and most of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste collection services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing  and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing of their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
our revenues from e p treatment and disposal consist mainly of fees that we charge for the treatment of liquid and solid waste derived from the production of oil and natural gas 
we also generate income from the transportation of waste to the disposal facility in certain markets and the sale of reclaimed oil and processed and treated waters 
our revenues from recycling services consist of selling recyclable materials including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals collected from our residential customers and at our recycling processing operations to third parties for processing before resale 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo and solid waste containers and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 

table of contents no single contract or customer accounted for more than of our total revenues at the consolidated or reportable segment level during the periods presented 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided dollars in thousands 
years ended december  solid waste collection solid waste disposal and transfer e p waste treatment  disposal and recovery solid waste recycling intermodal and other less intercompany elimination total revenue cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  vehicle and equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment insurance  insurance and employee group health claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  vehicle and equipment maintenance  taxes and fees  insurance and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  utilizing comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
we carry high deductible insurance for automobile liability  property  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability and employer group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expense includes management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  acquisition expenses  bad debt expense and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and probable expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of finite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts  customer lists and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense all third party and indirect acquisition costs  including third party legal and engineering expenses  executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
for example  if we are unsuccessful in our attempts to obtain or defend permits that we are seeking or have been awarded to operate or expand a landfill  we will no longer generate anticipated income from the landfill and we will be required to expense in a future period the amount of capitalized expenditures related to the landfill or expansion project  less the recoverable value of the property and other amounts recovered

total revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from billion for the year ended december  revenues during the period from october  to december  from the r acquisition were million 
all other acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   increased revenues by approximately million 
operations divested during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   decreased revenues by approximately million 
during the year ended december   the net increase in prices charged to our customers was million  consisting of million of core price increases and million of fuel  materials and environmental surcharges 
volume decreases in our existing business during the year ended december   decreased revenues by approximately million 
the net decreases in volume were primarily attributable to decreases in landfill municipal solid waste volumes  due primarily to the decision to forego low priced tonnage from one large hauler at one of our large landfills  lower landfill special waste volumes  due primarily to a decrease in large non recurring projects  decreased commercial hauling revenue  due primarily to service level declines with existing customers and a reduction in customer counts due to competition in our markets  and decreased roll off hauling activity  due primarily to construction slowdowns affecting our markets  partially offset by increased e p waste treatment and disposal activity  due to increased drilling activity 
decreased recyclable commodity prices during the year ended december   partially offset by increased recyclable commodity volumes collected  decreased revenues by million 
the decrease in recyclable commodity prices was primarily due to decreased overseas demand for recyclable commodities 
other revenues increased by million during the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in cargo volume at our intermodal operations 
we expect our revenues to increase during the year ending december  compared to the year ended december   due to the impact of a full year of results from acquisitions completed during  particularly our r acquisition  which has only been reflected in our results since the closing of the acquisition on october  
table of contents cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of million of additional operating costs during the period from october  to december  from the r acquisition  million of additional operating costs from all other acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   and the following changes at operations owned in comparable periods in and an increase in labor expenses of million due to employee pay increases  an increase in truck  container and equipment maintenance and repair expenses of million due to increases in the prices for parts and services and variability in the timing and severity of major equipment repairs  an increase in third party trucking and transportation expenses of million due to changes in the disposal internalization of collected waste volumes and increased special waste projects that require us to transport the volume to our disposal sites  an increase in disposal expenses on collected volumes of million due to disposal rate increases and re directing collected waste volumes to alternative third party disposal sites  an increase in employee benefit expenses of million due to an increase in claims severity under our self insured medical plan  an increase in leachate disposal costs of million at certain landfills we own  an increase in auto and workers compensation expense under our high deductible insurance program of million due to an increase in projected losses on open claims  an increase in equipment and real estate rental expense of million associated with new facility leases and an increase in short term equipment rentals  an increase in diesel fuel expenses of million resulting from the net impact of higher market prices for fuel and reduced fuel gallons consumed in our operations  an increase in landfill monitoring and maintenance expenses of million  an increase in insurance premiums under our high deductible insurance program of million due to our growth from acquisitions  an increase in rail transportation expenses at our intermodal operations of million due to rate increases and increased rail cargo volume and million of other net increases  partially offset by a decrease in taxes on revenues of million due primarily to lower landfill revenues at our western segment  which has higher tax rates on disposal revenues  and a decrease in the cost of recyclable commodities of million due to declines in commodity values 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a percentage point increase from increased vehicle  container and equipment maintenance expenses  a percentage point increase from increased labor expenses  a percentage point increase in disposal expenses  a percentage point increase from increased third party trucking expenses  a percentage point increase from increased employee benefit expenses  a percentage point increase from increased leachate disposal expenses  a percentage point increase in equipment and real estate rental expenses and a percentage point increase from increased auto and workers compensation expenses  partially offset by a percentage point decrease from decreased taxes on revenues and a percentage point decrease due to acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december  having lower cost of operations as a percentage of revenue than our company average 
we expect our cost of operations to increase during the year ending december  compared to the year ended december   due to the impact of a full year of results from acquisitions completed during  particularly our r acquisition

table of contents sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a percentage point increase from expenses associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to the woodlands  texas  a percentage point increase from higher equity based compensation expense  a percentage point increase from the increase in direct acquisition expenses and a percentage point increase from increased payroll and severance expenses  partially offset by a percentage point decrease due to acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december  having lower sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue than our company average and a percentage point decrease due to the decrease in uncollectible accounts receivable 
in december  we commenced a relocation of our corporate headquarters from folsom  california to the woodlands  texas 
the relocation was substantially completed in in connection with the relocation  we have incurred a total of million in increased sg a costs in and related to personnel and office relocation expenses and estimate that we will incur between million and million in as we complete our relocation 
in addition  we expect to incur a loss on lease in either the second or third quarter of on the cessation of use of our former corporate headquarters in folsom  california  which we estimate could range between million and million 
we expect our sg a expenses to increase during the year ending december  compared to the year ended december   due to the impact of a full year of results from acquisitions completed during  particularly our r acquisition 
depreciation 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to million of depreciation and million of depletion during the period from october  to december  from the r acquisition  million of depreciation and million of depletion from all other acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   and an increase in depreciation expense associated with additions to our fleet and equipment purchased to support our existing operations of million  partially offset by a million decrease in depletion at our existing operations due primarily to a decrease in municipal solid waste and special waste landfill volumes 
depreciation expense as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was attributable to a percentage point increase from increase in depletion expense from landfills acquired during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   which have a higher depletion rate per ton relative to our company average  and a percentage point increase in depreciation expense at our existing operations due primarily to our operating equipment requirements remaining constant despite declines in revenues from volume decreases and decreased recyclable commodity prices  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in depletion expense at our existing operations due primarily to lower landfill municipal solid waste and special waste volumes 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to million of amortization expense during the period from october  to december  for permits and customer lists from the r acquisition and million of amortization expense for contracts and customer lists acquired from all other acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december  amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense as a percentage of revenues was due to the aforementioned amortization expense increases 
gain from litigation settlement 
gain from litigation settlement of million for the year ended december  consists of an award received from an arbitration we filed against a counter party to a disposal agreement that breached that agreement 
operating income 
operating income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the million increase in operating costs  million increase in sg a expense  million increase in depreciation expense and million increase in amortization of intangibles expense  partially offset by the million increase in revenues and million increase in gain from litigation settlement 
operating income as a percentage of revenues decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to the previously described percentage point increase in sg a expense  percentage point increase in cost of operations  percentage point increase in depreciation expense and percentage point increase in amortization expense  partially offset by the percentage point increase in gain from litigation settlement

if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities

inflation other than volatility in fuel prices and labor costs in certain markets  inflation has not materially affected our operations in recent years 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive pressures or delays in the timing of rate increases under our contracts may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates and fuel prices 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses over the unhedged fuel and variable rate debt positions 
at december   our derivative instruments included three interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows dollars in thousands date entered notional amount fixed interest rate paid variable interest rate received effective date expiration date march  month libor february february august  month libor april january december  month libor february february plus applicable margin 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  the interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged floating rate debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at december  and  of billion and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  term loan facility and floating rate municipal bond obligations 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations  subject to counterparty default risk 
the market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly 
we purchase approximately million gallons of fuel per year  therefore  a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins 
to manage a portion of this risk  we periodically entered into fuel hedge agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases 
at december   our derivative instruments included one fuel hedge agreement as follows date entered notional amount in gallons per month diesel rate paid fixed per gallon diesel rate received variable effective date expiration date june  doe diesel fuel index january december if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price  as published by the department of energy  exceeds the contract price per gallon  we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional number of gallons from the counterparty 
if the average price is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counterparty 
under derivatives and hedging guidance  the fuel hedge is considered a cash flow hedge for a portion of our forecasted diesel fuel purchases  and we apply hedge accounting to account for this instrument 

table of contents we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our unhedged diesel fuel purchases 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
for the year ending december   we expect to purchase approximately million gallons of fuel at market prices  and a per gallon increase in the price of fuel over the year would decrease our pre tax income during this period by approximately million 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the average prices that were in effect during the year ended december  and  would have had a million and million impact on revenues for the year ended december  and  respectively
