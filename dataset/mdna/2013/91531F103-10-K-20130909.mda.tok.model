table of contents overview unwired planet  inc referred to as unwired planet  upip  the company  our  we  or us is an intellectual property licensing company with approximately  mobile technology patents and patent applications 
prior to the closing of a transaction with a wholly owned subsidiary of telefonaktiebolaget l m ericsson ericsson  our patent portfolio included approximately issued united states and foreign patents and approximately pending applications that cover technologies applicable to the mobile industry 
on february   we closed a transaction with ericsson in which unwired planet  llc up llc  a variable interest entity organized and based in nevada that is consolidated by the company  acquired approximately  additional mobile technology patents and patent applications 
unwired planet  formerly known as openwave systems inc  was incorporated in as a delaware corporation  and we completed our initial public offering in june on february   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired a patent portfolio from ericsson that consists of approximately  patents and patent applications and the right to receive additional patents per year for five years beginning in the acquired patents cover technology utilized in telecommunications infrastructure and mobile devices including  among other things  signal processing  network protocols  radio resource management  voice text applications  mobility management  software  hardware and antennas and were purchased subject to existing encumbrances 
this purchase does not entitle up llc or the company to royalty payments that are currently being received by ericsson under third party license agreements on any patents included in the portfolio 
consideration to be paid to ericsson consists of a nontransferable  limited license to patents held by up llc and an amount equal to a percentage of future gross revenues generated by a combined patent portfolio that includes both the ericsson patents plus the company s legacy mobility patents fee share 
the fee share that ericsson will receive from the derived value of the patent portfolio is computed on a tiered basis 
specifically  ericsson will receive of the first million of gross revenue  of the next million and of any amounts above million 
the fee share has no termination date 
the ericsson patents and the company s patents the combined patent portfolio have been transferred to up llc 
up llc is capitalized with nominal equity from its two members  unwired planet ip holdings  inc and unwired planet ip manager  llc  both of which are wholly owned by the company 
the transaction with ericsson was completed pursuant to a master sale agreement dated january  between i ericsson and its subsidiaries and ii the company and its subsidiaries msa 
in addition  in connection with the completion of the transaction with ericsson  up llc adopted an amended and restated operating agreement of up llc operating agreement 
under the terms of the msa and the operating agreement  up llc is required to comply with a number of restrictions on its future activities described in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal year  we focused on propelling our new business strategy related to the intellectual property business as well as on our restructuring activity 
with the majority of restructuring activities behind us  today the company s business is focused entirely on pursuing a multi pronged strategy to realize the value of our patent portfolio 
our strategy ranges from direct licensing or sale of our patents  to litigation  joint ventures  and partnering with one or more intellectual property specialists 
we generate revenue by licensing our patented innovations and technologies to companies that develop mobile communications  software infrastructure or hardware and or develop mobile communications products 
our goal is to continue to create additional licensing opportunities 

table of contents to support our new strategy  we sought financing and on june   entered into an indenture agreement to provide for the issuance of senior secured notes due the notes in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
on this same day  the company entered into a note purchase agreement for the sale of notes in the amount of million with indaba capital fund  lp indaba 
the notes were offered at of the principal 
from the date of issuance of the notes up to and inclusive of the second anniversary of the date of issuance  the notes will bear interest at  paid quarterly as payment in kind 
payment date is the last day of each quarter  with the initial payment date being june  from the second anniversary of the date of issuance of the notes up to and inclusive of the maturity date of june   the notes will bear interest at a per annum rate of  paid quarterly in cash 
we may elect to pay interest as payment in kind with the issuance of additional notes  provided that in the event of such election  the per annum interest rate will be increased by 
on june   we also entered into a securities purchase agreement for a registered direct offering with indaba that provided for issuance of  shares of company common stock  par value for million 
on june   the company filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for a rights offering to stockholders as of the record date of july  collectively  the offerees of  shares of company common stock  par value per share  at a price of per share 
in connection with the rights offering  the company entered into a purchase agreement on june  with indaba the backstop purchase agreement to which indaba is obligated to purchase such number of unregistered shares of company common stock equal to the number of shares offered in the rights offering that are not purchased by the offerees 
the company is also obligated to issue to indaba  unregistered shares of company common stock backstop fee in consideration for providing its backstop purchase commitment backstop purchase commitment 
the backstop purchase commitment ensures that the company will have additional capital in the amount of million in exchange for the stock compensation fee of  company issued shares and as such is part of our financing transactions 
on august   our registration statement was declared effective allowing us to proceed with the rights offering 
the rights offering period started on august  and it will expire at pm new york time on september  the note purchase agreement  registered direct offering  and backstop purchase agreements are collectively referred to as the transactions or financing agreements 
our strategy is still in the early stages of its implementation 
the capital we raised in fiscal through the registered direct offering agreement and the senior secured notes will be used to finance our operations  especially patent initiative expense  as we have not yet generated any significant revenues from our new strategy 
in fiscal we recorded losses from continuing operations of million 
as of june  we had full time employees 
as we execute our licensing strategy  we anticipate the related revenue in future periods to be unpredictable and volatile 
additionally  legal costs associated with our efforts to license and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be material at any given period and are unpredictable and volatile 
effectively policing and 
table of contents enforcing our intellectual property is time consuming and costly 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any ongoing or future litigation will be successful 
critical accounting policies and judgments we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our business and prospects for our future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management judgment and estimates 
these significant accounting policies are classification of continuing and discontinued operations revenue recognition stock based compensation valuation of investments restructuring related assessments allocation of proceeds from debt and equity transactions with indaba these policies and our procedures related to these policies are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our accounting policies 
classification of continuing and discontinued operations due to the sale of our remaining product businesses in  we have presented financial results for the product businesses as discontinued operations 
as the majority of costs related to employees and operations in the past related to our product operations  we identified costs we considered to be related to the ongoing intellectual property business for presentation as continuing operations 
costs we identified as relating to continuing operations include costs related to all personnel dedicated to our patent initiatives  including external legal fees and support personnel 
additionally  certain general and administrative costs were included  which are equivalent to the resources we expect to have on an ongoing basis after our transition to an intellectual property business 
this includes costs related to our chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer  as well as accounting  information systems  and support personnel 
all compensation  benefits  stock based compensation  and restructuring costs  if any  associated with these positions  were included in ongoing operations 
additionally  we included costs related to being a public company  such as external audit costs  costs associated with the sarbanes oxley act  board of directors fees  sec filings and nasdaq fees 
facilities and information technology costs were allocated based upon the percentage of headcount of the employees assumed to be working primarily for the intellectual property business 
restructuring costs related to facilities remained in continuing operations  as we have retained the related liabilities 
all other historical costs were classified as discontinued operations as they were considered necessary to support the product business 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  
table of contents and iv collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
to date  revenue from upfront payments from licensees for the licensing of our patents has been recognized when the arrangement is mutually signed  since there has been no delivery or future performance obligation and the other three criteria are met upon signing the arrangement 
when patent licensing arrangements include royalties for future sales of the licensees products using our licensed patented technology  revenue is recognized when the royalty report is received from the licensee  at which time the fixed and determinable criteria are met 
on february   the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired a patent portfolio from a wholly owned subsidiary of ericsson that consists of approximately  patents and patent applications and the right to receive additional patents per year for five years beginning in the acquired patents cover technology utilized in telecommunications infrastructure and mobile devices including  among other things  signal processing  network protocols  radio resource management  voice text applications  mobility management  software  hardware and antennas and were purchased by the company subject to existing encumbrances 
because of the restrictions on up llc and the rights and obligations of ericsson after the transaction  the company  for accounting purposes  has concluded that its arrangement with ericsson is executory in nature and accordingly has not given current recognition to it 
specifically  the company has not recognized an asset value for the patents received and has not recorded revenue from the license issued to ericsson 
revenues earned from licensing the combined patent portfolio will be recognized when the criteria for recognition have been met 
the fee share to ericsson will be recorded as a reduction in gross revenue when the fee share is paid or payable 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
stock based compensation stock based compensation is recorded utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of accounting guidance  which requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility was based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price  as well as implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock when appropriate 
during fiscal  and  implied volatility was not utilized in our valuation of options granted due to the lack of option contracts with a strike price similar to our stock option grants 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
our expected term of options granted is derived from actual post vesting option cancellation and exercise experience  as well as the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term for outstanding options 
on february  the company issued market based stock to a consultant for services provided in connection with the ericsson transaction 
if the volume weighted average trading price of the company s common stock over any consecutive trading days equals or exceeds first incentive fee prior to august  the consultant will receive  shares of company common stock 
an additional  shares of company common stock will be issued if prior to february  the volume weighted average trading price of the company s common stock over any consecutive trading days equals or exceeds second incentive fee 
the awards related to the incentive fees will only vest if the respective company common stock price targets are met 
the fair value of the awards for the incentive fees will be remeasured on a quarterly basis using a monte carlo simulation method and any changes in fair value will be recognized as expense or income in the statement of operations 
as of june   the fair value of the incentive fee awards was estimated at million and was recognized as a liability 
to the extent volatility of our stock 
table of contents price increases or decreases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of the market based stock options granted in the future could increase or decrease  thereby increasing or decreasing other income or expenses in future periods 
valuation of investment level inputs  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  provide the most reliable evidence of fair value 
level inputs  quoted prices in active markets  are available for all of our investments and are used to determine the fair value of our investments 
as of june  and june   million and million  respectively  in auction rate securities ars  recorded in long term investments on the consolidated balance sheet  were considered illiquid based upon lack of recent auction results 
we estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities based on financial standing of the issuer  size of position held and the liquidity of the market  contractual restrictions on disposition  pending public offering with respect to the financial instrument  pending reorganization activity affecting the financial instrument  reported prices and the extent of the public trading in similar financial instruments of the issuer or comparable companies  ability of the issuer to obtain required financing  changes in the economic conditions affecting the issuer  a recent purchase of the sale of a security of the issuer  pricing by other dealers in similar securities  financial statements of any underlying ars portfolio investments  successful auction early redemption  failing auctions until maturity  or default and the estimated cash flows for each scenario 
other factors are considered  such as interest rate effects  liquidity  trinomial probabilities  recovery rates  value of the investments held by the issuer and the financial condition and credit ratings of the issuer  insurers  and parent companies  as applicable 
assumptions of probabilities of default  probabilities of passing auction  and probabilities of earning the maximum rate for each period are based upon the risks  the underlying investments collateralizing the ars  the maturity date of the ars  the maximum rate of the ars and current market conditions  and third party professional judgment 
restructuring related assessments our critical accounting policy and judgment as it relates to restructuring related assessments includes our estimate of facility costs 
to determine facility costs  which consist of the loss after our cost recovery efforts from subleasing a building  some estimates were made related to the time period over which the relevant building would remain vacant  sublease terms  and sublease rates  including common area charges 
the facility cost is an estimate that may be adjusted in the future upon triggering events such as changes in estimates of time and rates to sublease  based upon current market conditions  or changes in actual sublease rates 
allocation of proceeds from debt and equity transactions with indaba the financing agreement transactions  including the senior secured notes  registered direct offering and the backstop purchase commitment and backstop fee were accounted for using fair value measurement 
fair value measurement requires that assets and liabilities be measured and recorded at their fair value  the amount that represents the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability 
because these transactions occurred simultaneously  they were accounted for using relative fair value 
the proceeds from the senior secured notes and  registered direct offering were allocated to the senior secured notes  registered direct offering and the backstop purchase commitment and backstop fee based on their relative fair value 
various factors were considered in determining the fair value of the transactions 
these factors include closing price per share on the date the transactions closed  cash interest payments on the notes  payment in kind 
table of contents payments on the notes  principal prepayment of the notes  the notes maturity date  the notes debt covenants  discount rates  market interest rates  company projections  comparable issues and spread analysis  capital asset pricing model scenarios  and backstop purchase commitment scenarios 
summary of operating results for fiscal  and revenues we generate patent revenue  which is derived from licensing our intellectual property 
to date our patent revenues have been from two licensees  microsoft  inc microsoft and mobixell networks  inc 
mobixell networks as shown in the following table of total revenue fiscal year ended june  microsoft mobixell networks the following table presents the key revenue information for fiscal  and  respectively dollars in thousands percent change fy from fy percent change fy from fy fiscal year ended june  revenues patents fee share net revenue patents revenues and fee share during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a license agreement with mobixell networks for a fee of million plus future royalties from domestic sales of products and related services covered under the patent license after september  we received royalties related to this agreement during the first  second  and third quarters of fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  mobixell networks exercised its rights under the licensing agreement to buy out all further royalty obligations 
the buyout amount was calculated based on the licensing agreement and was equal to million 
ericsson received its fee share of the buyout in the amount of  in accordance with the terms of the ericsson agreement 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the fee share agreement 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into a license agreement with microsoft whereby we licensed to them rights to all of unwired planet s patents for a fee of million which was received during the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents operating expenses the following table represents operating expenses for fiscal  and  respectively dollars in thousands fiscal year ended june  percent increase decrease percent increase decrease sales and marketing expense patent initiative expense general and administrative restructuring and other costs total operating expenses sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses in fiscal include costs related to public relations  advertising  promotional materials and other market development programs 
in fiscal we incurred million in sales and marketing expense 
with the sale of our product business  we have limited sales and marketing expense going forward 
the million of sales and marketing expense incurred during fiscal consisted primarily of commissions of million incurred during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with the patent deal signed in the quarter  as well as million in marketing expense incurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal prior to fiscal  patent revenues were not subject to a commission plan and our marketing activities were related to the discontinued operations 
patent initiative expenses patent initiative expenses include legal and consulting costs related to defending or asserting our patents  as well as salary and benefit expenses and travel expenses for our employees engaged in these activities on a full time basis 
patent initiative expenses are by far our largest expenses 
we are in a reactive business and some of our licensing expenses are related to the actions taken by defendant companies 
although our strategy focuses on licensing  we sometimes have to resort to legal actions to protect our patent rights 
during the fiscal year ended june   patent initiative expenses increased by approximately  or million  compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to an increase in legal expenses associated with patent litigation and an increase in patent maintenance costs associated with the acquired ericsson patents 
in fiscal  our litigation expense included legal fees in the first half of supporting the itc and delaware district court cases filed and announced in august  as well as the patent infringement cases against each of apple and google filed in the us district court for the district of nevada in september the company withdrew the itc investigation in october in addition  we incurred million in patent maintenance costs in fiscal associated with the acquired ericsson patents 
going forward  legal costs associated with our efforts to license and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be material at any given period 
during the fiscal year ended june   patent initiative expenses increased by  or million  compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to a million increase in legal expenses associated with patent litigation  which includes legal fees supporting the itc case filed and announced in august

general and administrative expenses also include outside accounting and legal fees  public company costs  and expenses associated with the board of directors 
during the fiscal year ended june   general and administrative costs increased  or million  compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to million increase in stock based compensation 
the increase in stock based compensation is made up of million in consultant compensation related to the ericsson transaction and million related to the ceo departure  which is partially offset by decreased other employee stock based compensation due to the reduced number of employees 
payroll and payroll related expenses increased by million in fiscal compared with the previous year primarily due to the bonus expenses associated with departure of the ceo and several key employees  contingent worker expenses  and increased recruiting costs 
legal fees increased million which primarily related to assistance with potential strategic alternatives  including expenses associated with the ericsson transaction 
additionally  the public company costs increased by approximately million primarily due to increased printing and public filing fees associated with corporate governance 
other professional fees increased by million due to costs related to the ericsson transaction and accounting fees increased by million in fiscal compared with fiscal as many of the costs incurred this year were one time events  we anticipate our general and administrative costs will decline in the future 
our board is generally compensated with options and restricted stock 
as of january  the shares within the board s option plan had decreased to a level insufficient to support their compensation 
the board members have agreed to defer receiving their stock based compensation in anticipation of the plan being replenished at the upcoming annual general meeting 
as a result  approximately million has been accrued for board compensation at june  in other accrued liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
during the fiscal year ended june   general and administrative costs increased  or million  compared with the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in stock based compensation expense  mainly due to charges related to stock grants modified upon the departure of two members of the board of directors and several key employees upon the sale of the product business  as well as restricted stock grants to key employees 
there was a million increase in salary and related costs  as more resources were allocated in support of unwired planet in order to establish new procedures to transition to our new business model 
also  overall costs associated with general legal costs  public company expenses and facility costs increased by approximately million 
these increases were offset by a decrease of approximately million in professional fees associated with accounting and auditing 
restructuring and other costs restructuring and other costs decreased by  or million  in fiscal compared with fiscal the current fiscal year contained million in charges associated with estimated severance  facility and accelerated depreciation costs as a result of our relocation to reno  nevada 
the decline in facilities restructuring costs from the 
table of contents prior year was due to a decrease in facilities accretion associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to reno  nevada 
we expect our restructuring costs to continue to decline in fiscal as we conclude our restructuring activities 
restructuring and other costs increased by  or million  in fiscal as compared with fiscal this increase was related to an increase of million in expense related to severance payments to two former executives  as well as an increase of million in new restructuring charges and adjustments to prior restructurings incurred during fiscal when compared with the prior year s period 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in facilities accretion 
interest income interest income totaled million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income over the last three years is primarily attributed to lower interest rates and lower investment balances due to cash used for operations 
interest expense we incurred interest expense during fiscal  and of  million  and million  respectively 
the majority of our interest expense for and relates to the line of credit facility and letters of credit entered into during the third quarter of fiscal the interest expense for fiscal was primarily related to the notes maturing on june  interest on the notes is payable in kind or in cash at our option through june of we expect our interest expense in fiscal to increase due to the note obligations 
other expense  net other expense  net totaled million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal we had million in income related to the fair value re measurement adjustment for the unearned liability classified consultant stock awards granted in conjunction with the ericsson transaction 
this was offset by the realized loss on the sale of the auction rate security in the amount of million that was recognized in the third quarter of fiscal year and by incremental changes in currency exchange rates 
the decrease in other expense  net in fiscal when compared with the prior fiscal year s period primarily relates to the million loss on investments realized in fiscal this saving was slightly offset by gains and losses on foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
income taxes income tax expense totaled  in fiscal income tax benefit totaled million in fiscal compared to our income tax expense of million in fiscal income tax expense for fiscal was related to foreign income taxes for our german foreign subsidiary in continuing operations 
this foreign subsidiary is accounted for in continuing operations 
fiscal tax expense was million lower than the prior year primarily due to recording a tax benefit from continuing operations in fiscal as the result of the gain on sale of discontinued operations 
we hold cash in foreign subsidiaries  which we intend to repatriate to the united states  and have recorded deferred income tax associated with the repatriation of the cash to the united states 

table of contents in light of our history of operating losses  we recorded a valuation allowance for all of our net deferred tax assets as we are presently unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities will be realized 
as of june   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately billion and million  respectively 
discontinued operations on january   the company announced its pursuit of strategic alternatives for its product operations 
on february   the company sold its non core product line  location  to a subsidiary of persistent systems ltd persistent systems for million in cash  with million of that amount being placed in an escrow account for a period of one year  to secure indemnification claims made by persistent systems  if any 
the company recorded a pre tax gain on sale of discontinued operations of approximately million within discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  the escrowed funds were distributed pursuant to agreements reached with persistent systems  resulting in a gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in the consolidated statement of operations 
upon the sale of the location business  the associated financial results have been classified as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
as of june   there were no assets or liabilities attributable to the location product business due to the sale of the discontinued operation on february  net loss from discontinued operations decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of a decrease in discontinued operations as we were concluding our activities related these operations 
the majority of expenses related to discontinued operations in fiscal were incurred as part of closing our foreign subsidiaries 
net loss from discontinued operations increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this was a result of the million decline in revenues  offset by corresponding reductions in cost of revenues as well as lower operating expenses during the same period 
the increase in the gain on sale of discontinued operations of million in fiscal when compared with million in fiscal primarily relates to the million gain recognized from the sale of the products business to openwave mobility  inc formerly  om  inc  openwave mobility  a portfolio company of marlin equity partners  a private investment firm  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as to the loss of million recognized in fiscal related to the settlement payment to myriad with no such comparable loss being recognized in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the classification of these businesses as a discontinued operation

in february  in connection with the closing of the ericsson patent purchase agreement  the company terminated its credit facility with silicon valley bank  but maintained certain letters of credit under the credit facility to the extent that such letters are fully cash collateralized 
the amount collateralized is reflected as restricted cash on the company s june  balance sheet for approximately million 
approximately million of this relates to the lease on the company s prior headquarters which ended in april per the lease agreement  the letter of credit associated with this lease expired as of june  and the related restricted cash was released in early july while we believe that our current working capital and anticipated cash flows from operations  as well as proceeds from the our financing activities  and the release of the restricted cash will be adequate to meet our cash needs for daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months  we may elect to raise additional capital through the sale of additional equity or debt securities  or sell some assets 
if additional funds are raised through the 
table of contents issuance of additional debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of our common stock and the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is necessary and we are unable to obtain the additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned intellectual property initiatives and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
in the meantime  we will continue to manage our cash and investment portfolio in a manner designed to facilitate adequate cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations as well as future acquisitions  if any 
working capital and cash flows our working capital  defined as current assets of the continuing operations less current liabilities of the continuing operations  increased by approximately from million as of june  to million as of june  the increase in working capital balance is attributed to the million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and a registered direct offering and a reduction of million in current liabilities  partially offset by the million net loss from operations 
the reduction in current liabilities was due to payments related to restructuring 
we do not anticipate significant uses of cash for restructuring going forward

we also experienced  in the same period  a decrease in restructuring liability in the amount of million 

table of contents additionally  we recognized million in non cash adjustments which included depreciation  amortization of intangibles  and stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we had two main drivers of the use of cash 
the first driver was that our net income  excluding the impact of non cash items and the gain on the sale of discontinued operations  was a use of cash of million 
the second driver was that we also experienced million of a restructuring liability decrease during the fiscal year ended june   which included million in severance paid to employees impacted by the restructuring announced in august additionally  we had other working capital changes as shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the million in cash used for operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to the million net loss adjusted for non cash items  a million decrease in restructuring liabilities and the million decline in deferred revenue related to discontinued operations  which represents a reduction in billings in advance of revenue recognized 
these uses of cash were offset by changes in working capital balances of million  primarily related to a decline in accounts receivable and an increase in accrued liabilities related to discontinued operations 
cash provided by investing activities cash flows provided by investing activities during fiscal  and totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
the  or million  increase in our cash flows provided by investing activities for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to proceeds from sales and maturities of short term and long term investments for the total amount of million  partially offset by the purchase of short term investments in the amount of million and the repayment of million related to the settlement of discontinued operations sold in the million increase in our cash flows provided by investing activities for fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily due to the million net cash flow related to the product business sales in fiscal  which was partially offset by the payment of the million related to the settlement of the myriad litigation as well as the purchase  net of maturities  of short and long term investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we have operated internationally and been exposed to potentially adverse movements in foreign currency rate changes 
with the disposition of our product businesses as of april   we have significantly reduced exposure to foreign currency rate changes and no longer enter into foreign exchange derivative instruments to hedge this risk 
we do not enter into foreign exchange transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that offsets the effects of movement in exchange rates 
net foreign exchange transaction losses included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations total income of  expense of million and income of million for the fiscal years  and as of june  and june   we had no forward contracts 
interest rate risk our primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  compared with million as of june  our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to money market accounts  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  and government securities 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers that have a rating by moody s of a or higher and standard poors of a or higher  and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents  all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments  all investments with maturities of greater than one year are classified as available for sale and considered to be long term investments

we have performed sensitivity analysis as of june  by using a modeling technique that measured the change in fair value arising from a hypothetical bps movement in the levels of interest rates  with all other variables held constant 
on june   a hypothetical decrease in market interest rates would change the fair value of the senior secured notes by an increase of million 
on june   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would change the fair value of the senior secured notes by a decrease of million 
however  this hypothetical change in interest rates would not impact the interest expense on the fixed rate debt 
interest rate risk is the risk that we incur economic losses due to adverse changes in the interest rates 
a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our ability to incur additional debt and could negatively impact our operations
