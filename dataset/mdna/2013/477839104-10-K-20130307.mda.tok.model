item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global technology solutions provider for the food processing and air transportation industries 
we design  manufacture  test and service technologically sophisticated systems and products for customers through our jbt foodtech and jbt aerotech segments 
we have established a large installed base of food processing equipment as well as airport support equipment and have built a strong global presence with manufacturing  sourcing  sales and service organizations located on six continents to support equipment that has been delivered to more than countries 
we successfully executed our g value creation strategy in we launched a number of new products and completed a technology acquisition 
we made continued progress in our aftermarket revenue streams and delivered growth in we opened a new plant in kunshan  china and expanded our presence in this key emerging market 
our consolidated gross profit margin expanded basis points 
we remain confident in our ability to generate cash flow from our operating activities and our commitment to returning it to our shareholders as we did by repurchasing our common shares and paying dividends during as we evaluate our operating results  we consider performance indicators like segment revenue and operating profit in addition to the level of inbound orders and order backlog

the increase in operating income resulted from the following gross profit declined by million but increased by million in constant currency 
gross profit margin increased by basis points 
gross profit improved due to various margin enhancement initiatives and cost saving plans executed in that resulted in million of gross profit increase versus this was offset by million in lower profit due to lower sales volume in our jbt aerotech segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  but increased by million in constant currency  mainly due to higher compensation and benefit costs  including the impact of lower discount rates utilized to estimate us pension costs 
research and development expense decreased by million as we focused engineering labor on improvements for existing products and customer orders

operating income decreased by million in compared to  while operating income margin decreased from to 
the decrease in operating income resulted from the following gross profit remained unchanged but decreased by million in constant currency 
gross profit decreased by million due to lower gross profit margin  which resulted from the strengthening of the swedish krona and brazilian real  higher costs in certain jbt foodtech product lines and an unfavorable mix of products sold as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by million of higher profit due to higher sales volume in the jbt aerotech segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  but only by million in constant currency  and decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
research and development expense increased by million  primarily due to expenditures on developing new gate equipment products 
restructuring expense was million higher than in the prior year 
in  the company implemented a cost reduction plan designed to grow margins by lowering costs in jbt foodtech across the developed world 
the cost reduction plan consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions

the increase in operating profit was driven by million of higher gross profit 
higher sales volume resulted in an increase of million in profits  while higher gross profit margin resulted in million of higher profit 
gross profit margin increased as a result of the favorable impact of savings from margin improvement initiatives and higher aftermarket revenue 
general and administrative expenses were million higher primarily as a result of higher compensation and relocation costs 
the remaining difference in operating profit was primarily due to lower research and development expenditures 
compared with jbt foodtech s revenue increased by million in compared to excluding the favorable impact of foreign currency translation  revenue decreased by million 
the decrease in revenue was driven by million of lower sales of freezing and chilling products and protein processing products primarily in the north american region 
this decrease was partially offset by shipments of several large orders of tomato and fruit processing products  which resulted in million of higher revenue  and higher sales of aftermarket parts and services  which resulted in million of higher revenue 
jbt foodtech s operating profit decreased by million in compared to operating profit margin decreased from to as a result of lower gross profit margin 
gross profit margin declined due to higher labor and material costs in the fruit processing product line  an unfavorable mix of aftermarket products sold as compared to the prior year and the strengthening of the swedish krona  resulting in million of lower operating profit 
we have historically exported the majority of our freezing and chilling products out of sweden 
however  we have expanded our production capabilities in the us and china to gain production flexibility and lower costs in future periods 
the remaining change in operating profit was primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation 
jbt aerotech compared with jbt aerotech s revenue decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in new equipment revenue declined million 
several passenger boarding bridge projects were delayed to late and  creating a production gap in a business with generally longer lead times 
this delay  along with the completion of a large us navy equipment contract  resulted in million of lower revenue in compared to higher recurring revenue from service contracts and sales of aftermarket products  parts and services partially offset the decrease in new equipment revenue 
jbt aerotech s operating profit decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in however  operating profit margins increased from to 
lower sales volume resulted in a decrease in profit of million 
the volume related decrease in profit was partially offset by gross profit margin improvement that resulted in million in higher profits  a decrease of million in selling  general and administrative costs  and a million gain on the transfer of the french hospital agv contracts and services and a reduction in research and development costs 
compared with jbt aerotech s revenue increased by million in compared to as a result of improved market conditions and the conversion of the strong year end order backlog into revenue 
revenue from gate equipment products increased by million as a result of higher sales of land based air conditioning units to the us navy and passenger boarding bridges to domestic airports 
revenue from automated systems increased by million as a result of large projects completed during the year 
revenue from ground support equipment products increased by million primarily as a result of higher sales of aircraft tow tractors to european and other international customers 
jbt aerotech s operating profit increased by million in compared to operating profit margin increased from to as a result of better leverage of fixed costs 
higher sales volume resulted in an increase in profit of million 
gross profit margin remained relatively unchanged 
the increase in operating profit from higher sales volume was partially offset by million of higher marketing expenditures  million of higher general and administrative costs and million of higher development costs related to new gate equipment products 
corporate items compared with corporate items increased by million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in in  we incurred million in connection with a cost reduction program in jbt foodtech 
these costs did not reoccur in during  we incurred higher corporate items including million in lower gains on foreign currency transactions  and million in higher compensation and pension related costs  including the impact of lower discount rates utilized to determine us pension costs 
in addition  we incurred million in higher expense for corporate development initiatives 
compared with corporate items increased by million in compared to the increase was driven by million of higher restructuring charges and million of higher lifo inventory reserve charges 
these increases were partially offset by million of lower stock based compensation expense and million of lower interest expense 
inbound orders and order backlog inbound orders represent the estimated sales value of confirmed customer orders received during the years ended december in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech other and intercompany eliminations total inbound orders order backlog is calculated as the estimated sales value of unfilled  confirmed customer orders as of december in millions jbt foodtech jbt aerotech total order backlog order backlog in our jbt foodtech segment at december  increased by million since december  the increase was driven by larger orders for in container processing products and tomato and fruit processing products 
the larger orders are expected to generate revenue in the later quarters of we expect to convert substantially all of the jbt foodtech backlog at december  into revenue during order backlog in our jbt aerotech segment at december  declined by million since december  order backlog at december  reflected two contracts with the us air force that were modified resulting in cancellation of million in remaining unfilled deliveries on those contracts  and were removed from backlog 
there had been no deliveries on these contracts  which had originally totaled million  since the resolution of these contracts did not have any impact on the sales or earnings 
we expect to convert approximately of the jbt aerotech backlog at december  into revenue during liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operating activities of our us and foreign operations and borrowings from our credit facility 
the cash flows generated by our operations and the credit facility have historically been sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  research and development activities  capital expenditures  pension contributions  authorized share repurchases  acquisitions and other financing requirements 
we are not aware of any circumstances that are likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing materially 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of which was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
although these funds are considered permanently invested in our foreign subsidiaries  we are not presently aware of any restrictions on the repatriation of these funds 
we maintain significant operations outside of the us  and many of our uses of cash for working capital  capital expenditures and business acquisition arise in these foreign subsidiaries 
if these funds were needed to fund our operations or satisfy obligations in the us  they could be repatriated and their repatriation into the us could cause us to incur additional us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
any additional taxes could be offset  in part or in whole  by foreign tax credits 
the amount of such taxes and application of tax credits would be dependent on the income tax laws and other circumstances at the time any of these amounts were repatriated 
on october   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our common stock through december  we repurchased million of common stock in the timing  price and volume of future repurchases will be based on market conditions  relevant securities laws and other factors 
cash flows cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended on december  were as follows in millions cash provided by continuing operating activities cash required by continuing investing activities cash provided required by financing activities cash required by discontinued operations effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by continuing operating activities in was million  representing a million increase compared to the change in cash flows provided by continuing operating activities is primarily attributable to a faster turnover in inventories and higher advanced payments during than during cash provided by continuing operating activities improved despite million in pension contributions and million in payments made in conjunction with the restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter of  we implemented a million cost reduction plan designed to grow margins by lowering costs in jbt foodtech across the developed world 
the cost reduction plan consisted primarily of a workforce reduction of approximately positions 
we expect to pay million in to complete the plan 
cash required by investing activities during was million representing an million increase compared to the change in cash required by investing activities is primarily attributed to an acquisition 
the majority of our investing activities support the maintenance and upgrading of our installed base of leased equipment 
our annual capital spending typically ranges from million to million 
we anticipate spending million to million on construction of a new jbt foodtech plant in lakeland  florida to replace an existing plant in the same area 
we did not make any substantial investment in this project in we expect to spend approximately million in each of and respectively  and about million on its construction in cash provided by financing activities in were million compared to cash required by financing activities of million in the change in financing cash flows is primarily attributable to an increase in the funds drawn under our us credit facility 
we have historically paid quarterly cash dividends of per share and repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the market 
financing arrangements we signed a new million year revolving credit facility in november that expires on november  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at libor or an alternative base rate  which is the greater of jpmorgan chase  na s prime rate  the federal funds rate plus basis points  and libor plus  plus a margin dependent on our leverage ratio 
we are required to make periodic interest payments on the borrowed amounts  and pay an annual facility fee ranging from to basis points  depending on our leverage ratio 
as of december   we had million drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit issued under the credit facility which reduce available borrowing capacity and million of additional available funds 
we have million of senior unsecured notes 
the senior unsecured notes are due on july  and require us to make semiannual interest payments 
our credit agreement and notes include restrictive covenants that  if not met  could lead to a renegotiation of our credit lines  requirement to repay our borrowings and or a significant increase in our cost of financing 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants of our loan agreement as shown in the following table debt instrument covenant measurement result as of december  revolving credit facility interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than restricted payments not greater than million plus of consolidated net income million senior unsecured notes interest coverage ratio not less than leverage ratio not greater than interest coverage ratio is a comparison of the trailing twelve months consolidated ebitda  defined as net income plus interest expense plus income tax expense plus depreciation and amortization plus non cash expenses and extraordinary  unusual and non recurring items  to trailing twelve months interest expense 
leverage ratio is a comparison of the total indebtedness  defined as total debt plus guarantees of indebtedness of others plus obligations under financial letters of credit issued against the credit facility  to the trailing twelve months consolidated ebitda  as defined above 
restricted payments include all payments to shareholders such as dividends and share repurchases 
we expect to remain in compliance with all restrictive covenants in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that continued or increased volatility in global economic conditions will not impair our ability to meet our restrictive covenants  or the volatility in the capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms acceptable to us or at all 
as part of our strategy to grow where the world is growing fastest  we are expanding our operations in china and india 
due to greater restrictions upon foreign currency exchange in these regions  we have established local credit facilities to fund some of the working capital requirements 
three of our wholly owned subsidiaries entered into short term credit facilities that allow us to borrow up to a total million in china 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowing under these credit facilities 
our wholly owned subsidiary in india entered into a short term credit facility that allows us to borrow up to approximately million 
as of december   we had million borrowed under this credit facility 
defined benefit pension plans we have defined benefit pension plans that cover certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is the us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation pbo and of the related plans assets 
due to a decrease in the discount rate used to value the pbo  the obligation increased by million in while the assets experienced a gain of 
outlook we started with higher backlog relative to december  however  a majority of the backlog is scheduled for delivery after the first quarter 
we anticipate a normal seasonally weak first quarter and earnings pick up in the subsequent quarters in line with our historical seasonality trends 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in millions total payments less than year years years after years long term debt a interest payments on long term debt b operating leases unconditional purchase obligations c pension and other postretirement benefits d total contractual obligations a our available long term debt is dependent upon our compliance with covenants described in the previous section 
any violations of covenants or other events of default  which are not waived or cured  could have a material impact on our ability to maintain our committed financial arrangements and accelerate our obligation to repay the amount due 
b interest payments were determined using the weighted average rates for all debt outstanding as of december  c in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements with our suppliers to purchase raw materials or services 
these agreements include a requirement that our supplier provide products or services to our specifications and require us to make a firm purchase commitment to our supplier 
as substantially all of these commitments are associated with purchases made to fulfill our customers orders  the costs associated with these agreements will ultimately be reflected in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of income 
d this amount primarily reflects discretionary contributions to our us qualified pension plan 
required contributions for future years depend on factors that cannot be determined at this time 
the following is a summary of other off balance sheet arrangements at december  amount of commitment expiration per period in millions total amount less than year years years after years letters of credit and bank guarantees surety bonds total other off balance sheet arrangements to provide required security regarding our performance on certain contracts  we provide letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees  for which we are contingently liable 
in order to obtain these financial instruments  we pay fees to various financial institutions in amounts competitively determined in the marketplace 
our ability to generate revenue from certain contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain these off balance sheet financial instruments 
our off balance sheet financial instruments may be renewed  revised or released based on changes in the underlying commitment 
historically  our commercial commitments have not been drawn upon to a material extent  consequently  management believes it is not likely that there will be claims against these commitments that would result in a negative impact on our key financial ratios or our ability to obtain financing 
critical accounting estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
on an ongoing basis  our management re evaluates these estimates  judgments and assumptions for reasonableness because of the critical impact that these factors have on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this disclosure 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting estimates used in preparing our financial statements 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
in order to determine net realizable value  we evaluate each component of inventory on a regular basis to determine whether it is excess or obsolete 
we record the decline in the carrying value of estimated excess or obsolete inventory as a reduction of inventory and as an expense included in cost of sales in the period in which it is identified 
our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period 
in addition  it requires management to make judgments about the future demand for inventory 
in order to quantify excess or obsolete inventory  we begin by preparing a candidate listing of the components of inventory that have not demonstrated usage within the most recent two year period 
this list is then reviewed with sales  production and materials management personnel to determine whether this list of potential excess or obsolete inventory items is complete and accurate 
management considers as part of this evaluation whether there has been a change in the market for finished goods  whether there will be future demand for on hand inventory items and whether there are components of inventory that incorporate obsolete technology 
then management assigns a reserve requirement  which is determined based on its assessment of cost recoverability  to the items on the candidate listing as well as changes in the estimated net realized value of excess and obsolete inventory 
as a result  our estimate of excess or obsolete inventory is sensitive to changes in assumptions about future demand for the inventory 
since the determination of the reserve requirement is based on management judgment rather than a formulaic approach  we are unable to quantify with a high level of precision the effect that a change in demand assumptions or estimated net realizable value would have on management s assessment of the excess and obsolete inventory reserve  although lower demand and or net realizable value assumptions would generally result in an increase in excess and obsolete inventory 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to the identifiable net assets 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level on an annual basis  or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we are required to make certain subjective and complex judgments in assessing whether an event of impairment of goodwill has occurred 
in addition  in testing for impairment assumptions  estimates and judgments are required to assess the fair value of our reporting units 
we may assess qualitative factors to make this determination  or bypass such a qualitative assessment and proceed directly to testing goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
in making a qualitative assessment  the factors we may consider include  but are not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and services  regulatory and political developments and entity specific factors such as strategies and financial performance 
if  after completing a qualitative assessment it is determined more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we proceed to a two step impairment test  in which we compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the test is not performed 
the second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value 
in this step the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
the determination of the fair value of our reporting units and the assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are primarily related to future earnings before depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures  the discount rate and the terminal growth rates 
we believe that the judgments made in assessing the fair value of our reporting units under the qualitative method and the assumptions and estimates that underlie our determination of the fair value of our reporting units when applying the two step quantitative approach are critical because they are subject to change from period to period 
differences in our actual future cash flows  operating results  growth rates  capital expenditures  cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of calculating the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as a decline in macroeconomic conditions  the industry  the market  overall financial performance or our stock price and related market capitalization  could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and  accordingly  potentially lead to future goodwill impairment charges 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of october  using a qualitative assessment approach 
as a result of the assessment of the relevant qualitative factors  we determined it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test on any of our other reporting units 
self insurance reserves we purchase third party insurance for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability claims that exceed a certain level 
we are responsible for the payment of claims under these insured limits as well as claims under our self insured healthcare plans 
the obligations associated with the incurred losses are determined using actuarial estimates 
these estimates are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
changes in assumptions for medical costs  environmental hazards and legal actions  as well as changes in actual experience  could cause these estimates to change which could potentially be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be included in a tax return in different periods than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the income tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return  and some are temporary  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which the tax payment has been deferred or expense for which we have already taken a deduction on an income tax return  but has not yet been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
we account for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of the temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
we make estimates and judgments with regard to the calculation of certain income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if  based on the consideration of all available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income and tax positions and strategies over the lives of the deferred tax assets  and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations 
forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment 
in estimating future income  we use our internal operating budgets and long range planning projections 
we develop our budgets and long range projections based on recent results  trends  economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments performance  our backlog  planned timing of new product launches and customer sales commitments 
significant changes in the expected realizability of the net deferred tax assets would require that we adjust the valuation allowance  resulting in a change to net income 
as of december   we estimated that it is not more likely that we will realize income tax deductions for certain uncollectible receivables and  therefore  we have provided a valuation allowance against the related deferred tax assets 
we have estimated that it is likely that we will generate future taxable income in the us and most foreign jurisdictions  and have therefore not provided a valuation allowance against most of our deferred tax assets 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans the measurement of pension and other postretirement plans costs and obligations require the use of assumptions for discount rates  investment returns  employee turnover rates  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension and postretirement benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension and postretirement benefit obligations 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences between assumed and actual experience may affect our operating results 
our accrued pension and postretirement benefits liability reflects the funded status of our worldwide plans  or the projected benefit obligations net of plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation is sensitive to changes in our estimate of discount rate 
the discount rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for the us pension plan  which represents of all pension plan obligations  was for  for  and for a change of percentage points in the discount rate used in our calculation would impact our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
our pension expense is sensitive to changes in our estimate of expected rate of return on plan assets 
the expected return on assets used in calculating the pension expense for the us pension plan  which represents percent of all pension plan assets  was for  for and for for  the rate will remain at 
a change of percentage points in the expected return on assets assumption would impact pension expense by approximately million pre tax 
see note of the consolidated financial statements in item for additional discussion of our assumptions and the effects on the consolidated financial statements 
during  we amended the retirement benefits offered to our employees 
we discontinued future benefit accruals for active non union participants in our domestic defined benefit pension plans and froze future participation in our domestic defined benefit pension plans by non union employees as of december  concurrently  we also enhanced our defined contribution savings plans by adding a non elective company contribution with immediate vesting for all eligible non union employees in addition to the current company match of up to on participant contribution that vests over time 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in february  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued an accounting standard that requires disclosure of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts not reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
this standard is effective prospectively for the company for annual and interim periods beginning january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact to our financial statements  however this standard does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued updated guidance on balance sheet offsetting 
this new standard provides guidance to determine when offsetting in the balance sheet is appropriate 
the guidance is designed to enhance disclosures by requiring improved information about financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
the goal is to provide users of the financial statements the ability to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements on an entity statement of financial position 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact to our financial statements  however this standard will only impact the disclosures within an entity financial statements and notes to the financial statements and does not result in a change to the accounting treatment of financial instruments and derivative instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in order to manage and mitigate our exposure to these risks  we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not use derivative financial instruments where the objective is to generate profits solely from trading activities 
at december   our derivative holdings consisted of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency instruments embedded in purchase and sale contracts 
these forward looking disclosures address potential impacts from market risks only as they affect our financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact our business as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices or equity prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  our foreign subsidiaries generated approximately of our revenue  led by our operations in sweden which generated approximately of our revenue 
financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries for which the us dollar is not the functional currency are translated into us dollars 
as a result  we are exposed to foreign currency translation risk 
when we sell or purchase products or services  transactions are frequently denominated in currencies other than an operation s functional currency 
when foreign currency exposures exist  we may enter into foreign exchange forward instruments with third parties to economically hedge foreign currency exposures 
our hedging policy reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we do not apply hedge accounting for our foreign currency forward instruments 
we economically hedge our recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we expect any gains or losses in the hedging portfolio to be substantially offset by a corresponding gain or loss in the underlying exposures being hedged 
we also economically hedge firmly committed anticipated transactions in the normal course of business 
as these are not offset by an underlying balance sheet position being hedged  our earnings can be significantly impacted on a periodic basis by the change in unrealized value of these hedges 
we use a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of an immediate adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar and all other variables are held constant 
we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments will offset the changes in fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
a adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the value of our derivative instruments by approximately million pre tax as of december  this amount would be reflected in our net income but would be significantly offset by the changes in the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk our debt instruments subject us to market risk associated with movements in interest rates 
we had million in variable rate debt outstanding at december  a adverse movement in the interest rate  which would amount to a change of basis points  would not significantly impact the annual interest expense
