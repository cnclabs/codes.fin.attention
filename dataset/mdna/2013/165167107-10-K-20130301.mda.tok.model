we are the second largest producer of natural gas  a top producer of liquids and the most active driller of wells in the us we own interests in approximately  producing natural gas and oil wells that are currently producing approximately bcfe per day  net to our interest 
the company has built a large resource base of onshore us unconventional natural gas and liquids assets 
our core natural gas resource plays are the haynesville bossier shales in northwestern louisiana and east texas  the marcellus shale in the northern appalachian basin of west virginia and pennsylvania  and the barnett shale in the fort worth basin of north central texas 
in addition  we have built leading positions in the liquids rich resource plays of the eagle ford shale in south texas  the utica shale in ohio and pennsylvania  the granite wash  cleveland  tonkawa and mississippi lime plays in the anadarko basin in northwestern oklahoma  the texas panhandle and southern kansas  and the niobrara shale in the powder river basin in wyoming 
we have also vertically integrated many of our operations and own substantial marketing  compression and oilfield services businesses 
proved reserves 
the company december  estimated proved reserves were tcfe  a decrease of tcfe  or  from tcfe at year end the decrease was primarily price related as natural gas prices in declined to the lowest levels in ten years 
the proved reserve movement included tcfe of extensions  downward revisions of tcfe resulting from lower natural gas prices and tcfe resulting from changes to previous estimates 
in  we produced tcfe  acquired bcfe and divested tcfe of estimated proved reserves  including the disposition of tcfe associated with the sale of our permian basin assets in september and october downward price revisions of tcfe were the result of a decrease in natural gas prices used in estimating proved reserves as of december  by  or  to per mcf from per mcf as of december   using the trailing month average prices required by the sec 
the reserve reductions included the loss of significant proved undeveloped reserves  primarily in the barnett shale and the haynesville shale plays  for which future development is uneconomic at the natural gas prices used in the reserves estimates 
as a result of lower estimated reserves as of september   we were required to impair the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties and  if the trailing month average natural gas  oil and ngl prices are lower in future periods  we could have additional impairments 
an impairment of this type is a non cash charge that does not impact our liquidity or our ability to comply with financial covenants 
future impairments of the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties  if any  will be dependent on many factors  including natural gas  oil and ngl prices  production rates  levels of reserves  the evaluation table of contents of costs excluded from amortization  the timing and impact of asset sales  future development costs and service costs 
we refer you to the risk factor declines in the prices of natural gas and oil could result in a write down of our asset carrying values included in item a of this report and the discussion below of the full cost method of accounting under application of critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties in this item in addition  see natural gas and oil properties in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
the tcfe downward revisions to previous estimates were primarily the result of altering our development plans as we made changes in rig allocations to shift rigs from natural gas to liquids rich plays and to focus drilling on the core areas of our plays 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion 
production 
our production of tcfe consisted of tcf of natural gas on a natural gas equivalent basis  mmbbls of oil on a natural gas equivalent basis and mmbbls of ngl on a natural gas equivalent basis 
daily production for averaged bcfe  an increase of mmcfe  or  over the bcfe produced per day in during  chesapeake curtailed approximately bcf of net natural gas production  or an average of approximately mmcf per day of natural gas spread across the year 
we undertook these curtailments primarily in the first half of in response to continued low natural gas prices 
the curtailed volumes were located primarily in the haynesville and barnett shale plays 
in recognition of the value gap between liquids and natural gas prices  chesapeake directed a significant portion of its technological and leasehold acquisition expertise during the past four years to identify  secure and commercialize new unconventional liquids rich plays 
this planned transition will result in a more balanced and  we believe  more profitable portfolio between natural gas and liquids 
in  our production of liquids averaged approximately  bbls per day  a increase over the average  as a result of the increased development of our unconventional liquids rich plays 
we expect to increase our liquids production through our drilling activities by approximately in compared to other operating segments 
in addition to our exploration and production operating segment  we also have a marketing  gathering and compression operating segment and an oilfield services operating segment that we utilize as a financial and operational hedge against inflation and to help assure that we have access to quality services 
in october  we formally segregated our oilfield services businesses under our wholly owned subsidiary  cos  and its wholly owned subsidiary coo 
coo subsidiaries include a leading us drilling contractor  oilfield trucking company  oilfield rental provider and a hydraulic fracturing business 
our oilfield services operating segment is separately capitalized  has its own revolving bank credit facility and coo issued senior notes in in september  we formally segregated our midstream gathering services under a wholly owned subsidiary  chesapeake midstream development  llc cmd 
during  we sold the majority of our midstream business  including our investment in access midstream partners  lp nyse acmp  as described under recent sales midstream sales below 
we have retained a minor portion of our midstream gathering business and still own significant marketing and compression operations businesses 
sales 
our business strategy is to create value for investors by building  developing and now harvesting what we believe is the largest onshore natural gas and liquids rich resource base in the us after years of building our resource base  we are focused on developing the plays where we have a or ownership position and selling assets outright or through joint venture transactions that are non core or do not fit our long term plans 
during  we completed sales of non core natural gas and oil properties  our midstream business and preferred equity interests in a subsidiary for proceeds of approximately billion 
we have announced our intention to sell natural gas and oil properties  midstream and other assets for expected total proceeds of billion in our sales program  together with our forecasted operating cash flow and borrowings under our corporate revolving bank credit facility  are anticipated to fully fund the company s capital expenditure program and further reduce the company s long term debt

joint ventures 
as of december   we had entered into seven significant joint ventures with other leading energy companies pursuant to which we sold a portion of our leasehold  producing properties and other assets located in seven different resource plays and received cash of billion and commitments for future drilling and completion cost carries of billion 
in each of these joint ventures  chesapeake serves as the operator and conducts all leasing  drilling  completion  operations and marketing activities for the project 
the carry obligations paid by a joint venture partner are for a specified percentage of our drilling and completion cost obligations 
in addition  a joint venture partner is responsible for its proportionate share of drilling and completion costs as a working interest owner

the cash proceeds from these transactions are reflected as a reduction of natural gas and oil properties with no gain or loss recognized 
planned sales we anticipate completing the sale of nearly all of our remaining midstream business  including our mid continent gathering systems and other assets  in the first half 
in addition to the mississippi lime joint venture discussed under recent developments  we have other natural gas and oil assets currently for sale  including our northern eagle ford assets and various portions of our marcellus and utica leasehold in pennsylvania and ohio that we consider non core 
we do not have binding agreements for all of our planned asset sales and our ability to consummate each of these transactions is subject to changes in market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our business is capital intensive 
historically  we have made capital expenditures that exceeded our cash flow from operations 
we project that our capital expenditures will continue to exceed our operating cash flow in  although by a significantly smaller amount as we continue our transition to an asset base more balanced between natural gas and oil from one primarily focused on natural gas and we shift to harvesting assets after approximately a decade of asset accumulation 
we also expect to benefit from operating efficiencies associated with our strategy of developing the core of the core of our substantial leasehold position 
during  the combination of high capital expenditures and reduced cash flow as a result of low natural gas prices led to a spending gap that we filled with borrowings and proceeds from sales of assets that we determined were non core or did not fit our long term plans 
we increased our debt  net of unrestricted cash  by approximately billion  to billion  in as of december   we had approximately billion in cash availability defined as unrestricted cash on hand plus borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facilities compared to billion as of december  as of december   we had negative working capital of approximately billion compared to negative working capital of approximately billion as of december  working capital deficits have existed largely because our capital spending generally has exceeded our cash flow from operations 
for  we plan to fund capital expenditures with operating cash flow  borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities and proceeds from asset sales 
our capital expenditure budget is approximately less than our capital expenditures  and as operator of a substantial portion of our natural gas and oil properties under development  we have significant control and flexibility over the development plan and the associated timing  enabling us to expeditiously reduce at least a portion of our capital spending if needed 
to mitigate our downside exposure to lower commodity prices  we have hedged approximately of our forecasted natural gas  oil and ngl production revenue  including downside hedge protection on approximately of our estimated natural gas production at table of contents an average price of per mcf most of these hedges were established subsequent to december  and of our estimated oil production at an average price of per bbl 
hedging allows us to reduce the effect of price volatility on our cash flows and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization ebitda 
based on our forecasted operating cash flow for  which takes into account our current hedges  and considering our forecasted capital expenditures  we are expecting a funding gap of approximately billion 
we believe we will have ample liquidity to fill the funding gap with borrowing capacity under our corporate revolving bank credit facility 
however  we plan to offset the need to borrow under our corporate revolving bank credit facility with sales of certain of our natural gas and oil properties  midstream and other assets and expect those total proceeds to be billion in through february  we have closed or have binding agreements on approximately billion of asset sales 
asset sales are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions and other factors beyond our control 
any remaining cash available after applying these proceeds to the deficit between capital expenditures and operating cash flow will be available to reduce our long term debt 
as part of our sales planning and capital expenditure budgeting process  we closely monitor the resulting effects on the amounts and timing of our sources and uses of funds  particularly as they affect our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our corporate revolving bank credit facility 
while asset sales enhance our ability to reduce debt  sales of producing natural gas and oil properties may adversely affect the amount of cash flow and ebitda we generate and reduce the amount and value of collateral available to secure our obligations  both of which can be exacerbated by low prices for our production 
in september  we obtained an amendment to our revolving bank credit facility agreement that relaxed the required indebtedness to ebitda ratio for the quarter ended september  and the four subsequent quarters 
see bank credit facilities corporate credit facility below for discussion of the terms of the amendment 
we would have been unable to meet the required ratio as of september  without this amendment primarily because the closing of certain asset sales transactions occurred in the fourth quarter and not in september as we had anticipated 
as a result  without the amendment  we would have been unable to reduce our indebtedness sufficiently as of september  to maintain our covenant compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the current covenants and would have also been in compliance with the more restrictive covenants that existed prior to the amendment 
failure to maintain compliance with the covenants of our revolving bank credit facility agreement could result in the acceleration of outstanding indebtedness under the facility and lead to cross defaults under our senior note and contingent convertible senior note indentures  hedge facility  equipment master lease agreements and term loan 
we expect to have adequate liquidity to repay million of senior note indebtedness that matures in further  we expect to meet in the ordinary course of business other contractual cash commitments to third parties pursuant to various arrangements  agreements and investments described in contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements below and in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  recognizing that we may be required to meet such commitments even if our business plan assumptions were to change due to circumstances beyond our control 
based upon our capital expenditure budget  expected commodity prices including the prices for our currently hedged production  our forecasted drilling and production  projected levels of indebtedness and binding purchase and sale agreements for certain future asset sales  we are projecting that we will be in compliance with the financial maintenance covenants of our corporate revolving bank credit facility  and we will have adequate liquidity  through we believe the assumptions underlying our budget for this period are reasonable and that we have adequate flexibility  including the ability to adjust discretionary capital expenditures and other spending  to adapt to potential negative developments if needed

we borrowed billion and repaid billion in  borrowed billion and repaid billion in and borrowed billion and repaid billion in under our revolving bank credit facilities 
our corporate facility is secured by natural gas and oil proved reserves 
a significant portion of our natural gas and oil reserves are currently unencumbered and therefore available to be pledged as additional collateral if needed to respond to borrowing base and collateral redeterminations our lenders might make in the future 
we believe our borrowing capacity under this facility will not be reduced as a result of any such future redeterminations 
our oilfield services facility is secured by substantially all of our wholly owned oilfield services assets and is not subject to periodic borrowing base redeterminations

c reflects derivatives deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception 
our primary use of funds is for capital expenditures related to exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
drilling and completion costs during reflected the impact of our deliberate transition to liquids focused drilling and reduced natural gas drilling and a reduction in the amount of drilling and completion carries received from our joint venture partners 
during the first quarter  our rig count was as high as rigs as we were quickly ramping up our liquids focused drilling while  at the same time  we were gradually ramping down drilling of natural gas wells 
as of february   our rig count had been reduced to operated rigs 
our natural gas drilling activities were sharply reduced in  from rigs at the beginning of the year to an average of rigs in the fourth quarter 
the drilling and completion expenditures also reflected significant well completion costs for natural gas wells that had been drilled  but not completed  in prior periods 
these completions  which represented more than of all natural gas wells we completed during  enabled us to hold by production the related leasehold according to the terms of our leases 
approximately of our unproved property leasehold acquisition costs of billion during were focused on adding to our acreage in the utica  marcellus and mid continent plays 
capital expenditures related to our midstream  oilfield services and other fixed assets of billion during were primarily related to the expansion of our gathering systems and the growth of our oilfield services businesses  in particular the hydraulic fracturing line of business 
we sold substantially all of our midstream business in december in october and november  we fully repaid the billion may term loans for billion with cash proceeds from asset sales and proceeds from the issuance of our november term loan 
we recorded a loss of approximately million with this repayment 
in  we completed and settled tender offers to purchase billion in principal amount of our senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes for billion in cash  including approximately million in cash premiums  primarily funded with a portion of the net proceeds we received from the sale of our fayetteville shale assets

corporate credit facility a oilfield services credit facility b in millions facility structure senior secured revolving senior secured revolving maturity date december november borrowing capacity amount outstanding as of december  letters of credit outstanding as of december  a co borrowers are chesapeake exploration  llc  chesapeake appalachia  llc and chesapeake louisiana  llc b borrower is chesapeake oilfield operating  llc our credit facilities do not contain material adverse change or adequate assurance covenants 
although the applicable interest rates under our corporate credit facility fluctuate slightly based on our long term senior unsecured credit ratings  our credit facilities do not contain provisions which would trigger an acceleration of amounts due under the respective facilities or a requirement to post additional collateral in the event of a downgrade of our credit ratings 
corporate credit facility 
our billion syndicated revolving bank credit facility is used for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility are secured by proved reserves and bear interest at a variable rate 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the amended agreement as of december  for further discussion on the terms of our corporate credit facility  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
as described above in liquidity overview  in september  we entered into an amendment to the credit facility agreement  effective september  the amendment  among other things  adjusts our required indebtedness to ebitda ratio covenant through the earlier of a december  and b the date on which we elect to reinstate the indebtedness to ebitda ratio in effect prior to the amendment in either case  the amendment effective period 
the amendment increased the maximum indebtedness to ebitda ratio as of september  from to to to and revised the required ratio for the next four quarters as shown below 
the ratio returns to to as of december  and thereafter 
effective date indebtedness to ebitda ratio december  to march  to june  to september  to table of contents our actual indebtedness to ebitda ratio as of december  was approximately to 
the ratio compares consolidated indebtedness to consolidated ebitda  both non gaap financial measures that are defined in the credit facility agreement  for the month period ending on the measurement date 
consolidated indebtedness consists of outstanding indebtedness  less the cash and cash equivalents of chesapeake and certain of our subsidiaries 
consolidated ebitda consists of the net income of chesapeake and certain of our subsidiaries  excluding income from investments and non cash income plus interest expense  taxes  depreciation  amortization expense and other non cash expenses  and is calculated on a pro forma basis to give effect to any acquisitions  divestitures or other changes 
the credit facility amendment increases the applicable margin by for borrowings under the corporate credit facility on each day during the amendment effective period when borrowings exceed of the borrowing capacity and requires us to pay a fee to each lender in an amount equal to of its revolving commitment if the amendment effective period is in effect on june  based on current commitment levels  this would result in an additional payment of million 
in addition  the amendment does not allow our collateral value securing the borrowings to be more than million below the collateral value that was in effect as of september  during the amendment effective period 
oilfield services credit facility 
our million syndicated oilfield services revolving bank credit facility is used to fund capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes associated with our oilfield services operations 
the facility may be expanded from million to million at coo s option  subject to additional bank participation 
borrowings under the credit facility are secured by all of the equity interests and assets of coo and its wholly owned subsidiaries the restricted subsidiaries for this facility  but they are unrestricted subsidiaries under chesapeake senior notes  contingent convertible senior notes  term loan and corporate revolving bank credit facility  and bear interest at a variable interest rate 
for further discussion of the terms of our oilfield services credit facility  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
midstream credit facility 
prior to june   we utilized a million midstream syndicated senior secured revolving bank credit facility to fund capital expenditures to build natural gas gathering and other systems in support of our drilling program and for general corporate purposes associated with our midstream operations 
with the anticipated sale of the substantial majority of our midstream business in the second half of  on june   we paid off and terminated our midstream credit facility 
hedging facility we have a multi counterparty secured hedging facility with counterparties that have committed to provide approximately tcfe of hedging capacity for natural gas  oil and ngl price derivatives and tcfe for basis derivatives with an aggregate mark to market capacity of billion under the terms of the facility 
for further discussion of the terms of our hedging facility  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
term loans may term loans 
in may  we entered into billion of unsecured term loans under a credit agreement that provided for term loans in an aggregate principal amount of billion 
the net proceeds of the term loans of approximately billion after discount  customary fees and syndication costs were used to repay borrowings under our corporate revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
the term loans were issued at a discount of  or million  and the customary fees and syndication costs incurred were approximately million 
in october and november  we used proceeds from asset sales and our new term loan the november term loan described below to fully repay the may term loans 
we recorded million of associated losses with the repayment  including million of deferred charges and million of debt discount 
november term loan 
in november  we established an unsecured five year term loan credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of billion for net proceeds of billion november term loan 
our obligations under the facility rank equally with our outstanding senior notes and contingent convertible senior notes and are unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by our direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries that are subsidiary guarantors under the indentures for such notes 
amounts borrowed under the new facility  which priced at of par  bear interest at libor plus 
the libor rate is subject to a floor of per annum 
the new facility is non callable in the first year but may be voluntarily repaid without penalty in the second and third years at par plus a specified call premium and may be voluntarily repaid at any time thereafter at par 
we used the net proceeds of the new term loan to fully repay the remaining outstanding borrowings under our may term loans table of contents and to repay outstanding borrowings under the company corporate revolving bank credit facility 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion

table of contents credit risk derivative instruments that enable us to manage our exposure to natural gas  oil and ngl prices and interest rate volatility expose us to credit risk from our counterparties 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are rated investment grade and deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers  and we attempt to limit our exposure to non performance by any single counterparty 
during the more than years we have engaged in hedging activities  we have experienced a counterparty default only once lehman brothers in september  and the total loss recorded in that instance was immaterial 
on december   our natural gas  oil and interest rate derivative instruments were spread among counterparties 
additionally  the counterparties under our multi counterparty secured hedging facility are required to secure their obligations in excess of defined thresholds 
we use this facility for the majority of our natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of natural gas  oil and ngl billion at december  and exploration and production companies that own interests in properties we operate million at december  
this industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers and joint working interest owners may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit or parent guarantees for receivables from parties which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
during  and  we recognized nominal amounts of bad debt expense related to potentially uncollectible receivables

f does not include our costs to produce reserves attributable to non expense bearing royalty and other interests in our properties  including vpps  which are discussed below 
as the operator of the properties from which vpp volumes have been sold  we have the responsibility to bear the cost of producing the reserves attributable to such interests  which we include as a component of production expenses and production taxes in our consolidated statements of operations in the periods such costs are incurred 
as with all non expense bearing royalty interests  volumes conveyed in a vpp transaction are excluded from our estimated proved reserves  however  the estimated production expenses and taxes associated with vpp volumes expected to be delivered in future periods are included as a reduction of the future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves for purposes of determining the cost center ceiling for impairment purposes and in determining our standardized measure 
the amount of these production expenses and taxes  based on cost levels as of december table of contents  pursuant to sec reporting requirements  was estimated to be approximately million in total and million for the next twelve months on an undiscounted basis and approximately million and million  respectively  on a discounted basis using an annual discount rate of 
our commitment to bear the costs on any future production of vpp volumes is not reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
the costs that will apply in the future will depend on the actual production volumes as well as the production costs and taxes in effect during the periods in which such production actually occurs  which could differ materially from our current and historical costs  and production may not occur at the times or in the quantities projected  or at all 
we have committed to purchase natural gas and liquids associated with our vpp transactions 
production purchased under these arrangements is based on market prices at the time of production  and the purchased natural gas and liquids are resold at market prices

hedging activities natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas  oil and ngl 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
executive management is involved in all risk management activities and the board of directors reviews the company hedging program at its quarterly board meetings 
we believe we have sufficient internal controls to prevent unauthorized hedging 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments consisted of swaps  options  swaptions and basis protection swaps 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk contains a description of each of these instruments and realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives during  and although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
hedging allows us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices we will receive for our hedged production 
we closely monitor the fair value of our derivative contracts and may elect to settle a contract prior to its scheduled maturity date in order to lock in a gain or minimize loss 
commodity markets are volatile and chesapeake hedging activities are dynamic 
mark to market positions under commodity derivative contracts fluctuate with commodity prices 
as described under hedging facility in item a  our secured multi counterparty hedging facility allows us to minimize the potential liquidity impact of significant mark to market fluctuations in the value of such derivatives by pledging our proved reserves

a detailed explanation of accounting for natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item interest rate derivatives to mitigate our exposure to volatility in interest rates related to our senior notes and credit facilities  we enter into interest rate derivatives 
for interest rate derivative contracts designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair values of the derivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities  with corresponding offsetting adjustments to the debt carrying value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives not designated as fair value hedges  which occur prior to their maturity ie  temporary fluctuations in mark to market values  are reported currently in the consolidated statements of operations as interest expense and characterized as unrealized gains losses 
gains or losses from interest rate derivative contracts are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and a detailed explanation of accounting for interest rate derivatives appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item foreign currency derivatives on december   we issued million of euro denominated senior notes due concurrent with the issuance of the euro denominated senior notes  we entered into cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes 
in may  we purchased and subsequently retired million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer  and we simultaneously unwound the cross currency swaps for the same principal amount 
a detailed explanation of accounting for foreign currency derivatives appears under application of critical accounting policies hedging elsewhere in this item results of operations general 
for the year ended december   chesapeake had a net loss of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion 
this compares to net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december   and net income of billion  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of billion during the year ended december  the decrease in net income from to is primarily driven by a billion after tax impairment of natural gas and oil properties recorded in the third quarter 
see impairment of natural gas and oil properties below 
natural gas  oil and ngl sales 
during  natural gas  oil and ngl sales were billion compared to billion in and billion in in  chesapeake produced and sold tcfe at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to tcfe produced and sold in at a weighted average price of per mcfe and tcfe in at a weighted average price of per mcfe weighted average prices exclude the effect of unrealized gains on derivatives of million  unrealized losses on derivatives of million and unrealized losses of million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in price received per mcfe in compared to resulted in a decrease in revenues of billion and increased production resulted in a billion increase in revenues  for a total decrease in revenues of billion excluding unrealized gains or losses on natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives 
the increase in production from period to period was primarily generated through the drillbit 
for  we realized an average price per mcf of natural gas of  compared to in and in weighted average prices exclude the effect of unrealized gains or losses on derivatives 
oil prices realized per barrel excluding unrealized gains or losses on derivatives were  and in  and  respectively

assuming the production levels  an increase or decrease of per mcf of natural gas sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  and an increase or decrease of per barrel of liquids sold would result in an increase or decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  without considering the effect of hedging activities

b our barnett shale production is concentrated in urban areas where the cost to develop the necessary infrastructure to gather and deliver the natural gas to intrastate pipelines significantly exceeds the cost of similar infrastructure in non urban areas 
additionally  the rapid development of the barnett shale required the construction of new pipelines to provide an adequate market for these new gas reserves 
in order to support the timely construction of these new pipelines  we entered into firm transportation contracts that have resulted in lower natural gas price realizations in the barnett shale than in our other major natural gas plays 
c our eastern division primarily includes the marcellus shale  which held approximately of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of december  production for the marcellus shale for the years ended  and was bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively 
table of contents d our western division primarily includes the eagle ford shale  which held approximately of our estimated proved reserves by volume as of december  production for the eagle ford shale for the years ended  and was bcfe  bcfe and bcfe  respectively 
as the eagle ford shale continues to be a developing play where additional infrastructure is being added to meet the growing production  we experienced lower natural gas price realizations in as a result of higher transportation costs compared to more developed plays 
e  and production reflects various asset sales 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information on our natural gas and oil property divestitures 
our average daily production of bcfe for consisted of bcf of natural gas on a natural gas equivalent basis and approximately  bbls of liquids  consisting of approximately  bbls of oil on a natural gas equivalent basis and approximately  bbls of ngl on a natural gas equivalent basis 
our year over year growth rate of natural gas production was  our year over year growth rate of oil production was and our year over year growth rate of ngl production was 
because of the value gap between natural gas and liquids prices  as liquids production has increased as a percentage of our total production the percentage of revenue generated through the sale of liquids production has increased substantially 
our percentage of unhedged revenues from natural gas  oil and ngl is shown in the following table 
natural gas oil ngl total marketing  gathering and compression sales and expenses 
marketing  gathering and compression sales and expenses consist of third party revenue and expenses related to our marketing  gathering and compression operations 
marketing  gathering and compression activities are performed by chesapeake primarily for owners in chesapeake operated wells 
chesapeake recognized billion in marketing  gathering and compression sales in with corresponding expenses of billion  for a net margin before depreciation of million 
see depreciation and amortization of other assets below for the depreciation and amortization recorded on our marketing  gathering and compression assets 
this compares to sales of billion and billion  expenses of billion and billion and margins before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  chesapeake realized an increase in marketing  gathering and compression sales and expenses primarily due to an increase in third party marketing volumes 
these increases were offset by lower margins per mcfe as a result of certain marketing arrangements whereby we resold natural gas and ngl at marginally lower market prices as compared to the contract price purchases of the natural gas and ngl 
we sold substantially all of our gathering business in the fourth quarter which will have a future impact on our marketing  gathering and compression sales and expenses 
our gathering business provided approximately million  million and million of the total marketing  gathering and compression net margin  or  and  in  and  respectively 
oilfield services revenues and expenses

this compares to revenue of million and million  expenses of million and million and a net margin before depreciation of million and million in and  respectively 
oilfield services revenues  expenses and margins have increased as our oilfield services business has grown  in addition to an increase in service rates throughout and these increases were offset by losses recognized in related to certain consolidated investments 
our oilfield services segment was negatively impacted by impairments and early lease termination payments in see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion 
natural gas  oil and ngl production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were billion in  compared to billion and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the per unit expense increase in was primarily the result of a new fee retroactively imposed in pennsylvania on spud wells  which had a million  or per mcfe effect  in addition to an overall table of contents increase in field rates and the lifting costs associated with vpp production for vpp and completed in march and may  respectively 
the per unit increase in was primarily the result of the sale of our fayetteville shale producing wells  which were high volume wells with lower per unit costs

production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were per mcfe in compared to per mcfe in and in in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when natural gas  oil and ngl prices are higher 
the million decrease in production taxes in was primarily due to the decrease from to of the unhedged price of our production from to per mcfe  offset by an increase in production of bcfe 
the million increase in production taxes in was primarily due to an increase in production of bcfe and an increase in the unhedged price of our production from to per mcfe

the per unit expense decrease in was primarily due to an increase in production of bcfe 
the actual and per unit expense increase in was primarily due to the company continued growth resulting in higher payroll and associated costs 
included in general and administrative expenses is stock based compensation of million in  million in and million in restricted stock expense is based on the price of our common stock on the grant date of the award 
our stock based compensation for employees and non employee directors during  and was in the form of restricted stock 
equity compensation helps offset the fact that we do not have a pension plan 
employee restricted stock awards generally vest over a period of four years 
our annual non employee director awards vest over a period of three years 
the discussion of stock based compensation in note and note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report provides additional detail on the accounting for and reporting of our stock based compensation 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with natural gas and oil property acquisition  divestiture  drilling and completion activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  divestiture  drilling and completion activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
in addition  we capitalize internal costs that can be identified with the construction of certain of our property  plant and equipment

depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in depreciation and amortization of other assets was  and per mcfe in  and  respectively

see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for information regarding our assets held for sale 
property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis and are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
to the extent company owned drilling rigs and equipment are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in natural gas and oil properties as drilling and completion costs

impairment of natural gas and oil properties 
in the third quarter of  we reported a non cash impairment charge on our natural gas and oil properties of billion  primarily resulting from a decrease in trailing month average first day of the month natural gas prices as of september  compared to june   and the impairment of certain undeveloped leasehold  primarily in the williston and dj basins 
we account for our natural gas and oil properties using the full cost method of accounting  which limits the amount of costs we can capitalize and requires us to write off these costs if the carrying value of natural gas and oil assets in the evaluated portion of our full cost pool exceeds the sum of the present value of expected future net cash flows of proved reserves using a pre tax discount rate based on pricing and cost assumptions prescribed by the sec and the present value of certain natural gas and oil derivative instruments

associated with these purchases  we recognized a loss of million in during  we redeemed in whole for an aggregate redemption price of approximately billion  approximately million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due  million in principal amount of our senior notes due and approximately million in principal amount of our senior notes due associated with the redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in also during  we redeemed in whole for a redemption price of approximately million  plus accrued interest  all million in principal amount of our senior notes due we recognized a loss of million in associated with the redemptions 
additionally during  we completed tender offers to purchase for cash million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due following the completion of these tender offers  we redeemed the remaining million of senior notes due  million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due based on the redemption provisions in the indentures 
associated with these tender offers and redemptions  we recognized a loss of million in finally  in  we privately exchanged approximately million in aggregate principal amount of our contingent convertible senior notes due for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
through these transactions  we were able to retire this debt for common stock valued at approximately of the face value of the notes 
of the million principal amount of convertible notes exchanged in  million was allocated to the debt component of the notes and the remaining million was allocated to the equity conversion feature of the notes and was recorded as an adjustment to paid in capital 
the difference between the debt component and value of the common stock exchanged in these transactions resulted in a million loss including a nominal amount of deferred charges associated with the exchanges 
impairment of investments 
we recorded million of impairments of certain investments in each of our investees was impacted by the dramatic slowing of the worldwide economy and the credit markets in and the economic weakness resulted in significantly reduced natural gas and oil prices which led to a meaningful decline in the overall level of activity in the markets served by our investees

table of contents application of critical accounting policies readers of this report and users of the information contained in it should be aware that certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies are an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
natural gas and oil properties 
the accounting for our business is subject to special accounting rules that are unique to the natural gas and oil industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for natural gas and oil business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from those of companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher natural gas and oil depreciation  depletion and amortization rate  and we will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
under the full cost method  capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved natural gas and oil reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense may be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves or future development costs changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in proved reserves and significantly alter the relationship between costs and proved reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties under the sec full cost accounting rules on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues adjusted for natural gas and oil cash flow hedges less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
in calculating estimated future net revenues  current prices are calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of natural gas and oil prices on the first day of each month within the month period prior to the ending date of the quarterly period 
costs used are those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly period 
such prices are utilized except where different prices are fixed and determinable from applicable contracts for the remaining term of those contracts  including the effects of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and natural gas and oil prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or an increase or decrease in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
any excess of the net book value  less deferred income taxes  is generally written off as an expense 
see natural gas and oil properties in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further information on the full cost method of accounting 
table of contents derivatives 
chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to mitigate a portion of our exposure to price fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices  changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
recognized gains and losses on derivative contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of commodity derivative contracts are reflected in natural gas  oil and ngl sales  and results of interest rate and foreign exchange rate hedging contracts are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying  or not elected  for designation as either cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are reported currently in the consolidated statement of operations as unrealized gains losses within natural gas  oil and ngl sales or interest expense 
cash settlements of our derivative arrangements are generally classified as operating cash flows unless the derivative is deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception  in which case these cash settlements are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designated as natural gas  oil and ngl cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as natural gas  oil and ngl sales 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized immediately in natural gas  oil and ngl sales 
for interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings as interest expense 
differences between the changes in the fair values of the hedged item and the derivative instrument  if any  represent gains or losses on ineffectiveness and are reflected currently in interest expense 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not qualify as hedges or are not designated as hedges are also recognized currently in earnings 
see hedging activities above and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
additionally  in accordance with accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  to the extent that a legal right of set off exists  chesapeake nets the value of its derivative instruments with the same counterparty in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our derivative instruments are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of natural gas  oil and ngl prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  the company financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december   and  the fair value of our derivatives were liabilities of million  billion and million  respectively 
variable interest entities 
an entity is referred to as a vie pursuant to accounting guidance for consolidation if it possesses one of the following criteria i it is thinly capitalized  ii the residual equity holders do not control the entity  iii the equity holders are shielded from the economic losses  iv the equity holders do not participate fully in the entity residual economics  or v the entity was established with non substantive voting interests 
we consolidate a vie when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the vie 
along with the vies that are consolidated in accordance with these guidelines  we also hold variable interests in other table of contents vies that are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary 
we continually monitor both consolidated and unconsolidated vies to determine if any events have occurred that could cause the primary beneficiary to change 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of vies 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
under accounting guidance for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of the tax benefit  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
if i natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  ii exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or iii we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of billion 
accounting guidance for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefit of the uncertain tax position to be recognized in the financial statements 
guidance is also provided regarding de recognition  classification and disclosure of these uncertain tax positions 
based on this guidance  we regularly analyze tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return based on the threshold condition prescribed 
tax positions that do not meet or exceed this threshold condition are considered uncertain tax positions 
we accrue interest related to these uncertain tax positions which is recognized in interest expense 
penalties  if any  related to uncertain tax positions would be recorded in other expenses 
additional information about uncertain tax positions appears in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
disclosures about effects of transactions with related parties chief executive officer as of december  and  we had accrued accounts receivable from our chief executive officer  aubrey k 
mcclendon  of million and million  respectively  representing joint interest billings from december and related to mr 
mcclendon participation in company wells pursuant to the fwpp 
these amounts were invoiced and timely paid in the following month 
since chesapeake was founded in  mr 
mcclendon has acquired working interests in virtually all of our natural gas and oil properties by participating in our drilling activities under the terms of his employment agreement and the fwpp and predecessor participation arrangements provided for in mr 
mcclendon employment agreements 
on april   the company board of directors and mr 
mcclendon agreed to the early termination of the fwpp on june   months before the end of the year term approved by our shareholders in june under the fwpp  mr 
mcclendon may elect to participate in all or none of the wells drilled by or on behalf table of contents of chesapeake during a calendar year  but he is not allowed to participate only in selected wells 
a participation election is required to be received by the compensation committee of chesapeake board of directors not less than days prior to the start of each calendar year 
his participation is permitted only under the terms outlined in the fwpp  which  among other things  limits his individual participation to a maximum working interest of in a well and prohibits participation in situations where chesapeake working interest would be reduced below as a result of his participation 
in addition  the company is reimbursed for costs associated with leasehold acquired by mr 
mcclendon as a result of his well participation 
in conjunction with certain sales of natural gas and oil properties by the company  affiliates of mr 
mcclendon have sold interests in the same properties and on the same terms as those that applied to the interests sold by the company  and proceeds were paid to the sellers based on their respective ownership 
on december   we entered into a new five year employment agreement with mr 
mcclendon that contained a one time well cost incentive award to him 
the total cost of the award to chesapeake was million plus employment taxes in the amount of approximately million 
the incentive award was subject to a clawback equal to any unvested portion of the award if during the initial five year term of the employment agreement  mr 
mcclendon resigned from the company or was terminated for cause by the company 
we are recognizing the incentive award as general and administrative expense over the five year vesting period for the clawback resulting in an expense of approximately million per year beginning in the net incentive award after deduction of applicable withholding and employment taxes of approximately million was fully applied against costs attributable to interests in company wells acquired by mr 
mcclendon or his affiliates under the fwpp 
on january   the company announced that mr 
mcclendon had agreed to retire from the company on the earlier to occur of april  or the time at which his successor is appointed 
mr 
mcclendon participation rights under the fwpp are expected to continue through the expiration of the fwpp on june   and the incentive award clawback applicable to will not apply 
see note for additional information on the terms of his separation from the company 
in  chesapeake entered into a license and naming rights agreement with the professional basketball club  llc pbc for the arena in downtown oklahoma city 
pbc is the owner of the oklahoma city thunder basketball team  a national basketball association franchise and the arena primary tenant 
mr 
mcclendon has a equity interest in pbc 
under the terms of the agreement  chesapeake has committed to pay fees ranging from million to million per year through for the arena naming rights and other associated benefits 
in addition  since  chesapeake has been a founding sponsor of the oklahoma city thunder  initially under successive one year contracts 
in  it entered into a year sponsorship agreement  committing to pay an average annual fee of million for advertising  use of an arena suite and other benefits 
chesapeake also has committed to purchase tickets to all home games 
in and  the company paid pbc approximately million and million  respectively  for naming rights fees  sponsorship fees and game tickets  and for  the amount payable for such season fees and tickets is approximately million  not including any amounts for playoff tickets 
pursuant to a court approved litigation settlement with certain plaintiff shareholders described under litigation and regulatory proceedings in item of this report  the sale of an antique map collection that occurred in december between mr 
mcclendon and the company will be rescinded 
mr 
mcclendon will pay the company approximately million plus interest  and the company will reconvey the map collection to mr 
mcclendon 
the transaction is scheduled to be completed not later than days after entry of a final non appealable judgment

recently issued and proposed accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued the following standards which we reviewed to determine the potential impact on our financial statements upon adoption 
in february  the fasb issued guidance on disclosure of information about changes in accumulated other comprehensive income balances by component and significant items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the new requirements include disclosing significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  if required to be reclassified to net income in their entirety 
other items will be cross referenced to other required disclosures that provide additional information about those amounts 
the guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  this guidance will not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk natural gas  oil and ngl derivatives our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for natural gas  oil and ngl 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the effective prices to be received for our production 
we believe our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving our risk management objectives 
our general strategy for attempting to mitigate exposure to adverse natural gas  oil and ngl price changes is to hedge into strengthening natural gas and oil futures markets when prices reach levels that management believes are either unsustainable for the long term  have material downside risk in the short term or provide reasonable rates of return on our invested capital 
information we consider in forming an opinion about future prices includes general economic conditions  industrial output levels and expectations  producer breakeven cost structures  liquefied natural gas trends  natural gas and oil storage inventory levels  industry decline rates for base production and weather trends 
we use a wide range of derivative instruments to achieve our risk management objectives  including swaps  options and swaptions 
all of these are described in more detail below 
we typically use swaps for a large portion of the natural gas and oil volume we hedge 
swaps are used when the price level is acceptable 
we also sell calls  taking advantage of market volatility for a portion of our projected production volumes 
we do this when we would be satisfied to sell our production at the price being capped by the call strike price or believe it would be more likely than not that the future natural gas or oil price will stay below the call strike price plus the premium we will receive 
in the second half of and in  we bought natural gas and oil calls to  in effect  lock in sold call positions 
due to lower natural gas  oil and ngl prices  we were able to achieve this at a low cost to us 
we deferred the payment of the premium on these trades to the related month of production being hedged 
at times  we have taken advantage of attractive strip prices in out years and sold natural gas and oil call options to our counterparties in exchange for near term natural gas swaps with fixed prices above the then current market price 
this effectively allowed us to sell out year volatility through call options at terms acceptable to us in exchange for natural gas swaps with fixed prices in excess of the market price for natural gas at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into oil swaps that can be extended at the option of the counterparty 
this allows us to receive a higher fixed price on these swaps than what the market would have offered without such an option 
some of our derivatives are deemed to contain  for accounting purposes  a significant financing element at contract inception and the cash settlements associated with these instruments are classified as financing cash flows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows 
we determine the volume we may potentially hedge by reviewing our estimated future production levels  which are derived from extensive examination of existing producing reserve estimates and estimates of likely production risked from new drilling 
production forecasts are updated at least monthly and adjusted if necessary to actual results and activity levels 
we do not hedge more volumes than we expect to produce  and if production estimates are lowered for future periods and derivative instruments are already executed for some volume above the new production forecasts  the positions are reversed 
the actual fixed price on our derivative instruments is derived from bidding and the reference nymex price  as reflected in current nymex trading 
the pricing dates of our derivative contracts follow nymex futures 
all of our derivative instruments are net settled based on the difference between the fixed price as stated in the contract and the floating price payment  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
we adjust our derivative positions in response to changes in prices and market conditions as part of an ongoing dynamic process 
we review our derivative positions continuously and if future market conditions change and prices are at levels we believe could jeopardize the effectiveness of a position  we will mitigate such risk by either doing a cash settlement with our counterparty  restructuring the position or by entering into a new trade that effectively reverses the current position 
the factors we consider in closing or restructuring a position before the settlement date are identical to those we reviewed when deciding to enter into the original derivative position 
gains or losses related to closed positions will be realized in the month of related production based on the terms specified in the original contract 
we have determined the fair value of our derivative instruments utilizing established index prices  volatility curves and discount factors 
these estimates are compared to our counterparty values for reasonableness 
derivative transactions are also subject to the risk that counterparties will be unable to meet their obligations 
such non performance risk is considered in the valuation of our derivative instruments  but to date has not had a material impact on the values of our derivatives 
future risk related to counterparties not being able to meet their obligations has been partially mitigated under our secured hedging facility which requires counterparties to post collateral if their obligations to chesapeake are in excess of defined thresholds 
the values we report in our financial statements are as of a point table of contents in time and subsequently change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions and other factors 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further discussion of the fair value measurements associated with our derivatives 
as of december   our natural gas and oil derivative instruments consisted of the following swaps chesapeake receives a fixed price and pays a floating market price to the counterparty for the hedged commodity 
options chesapeake sells  and occasionally buys  call options in exchange for a premium 
at the time of settlement  if the market price exceeds the fixed price of the call option  chesapeake pays the counterparty such excess on sold call options  and chesapeake receives such excess on bought call options 
if the market price settles below the fixed price of the call options  no payment is due from either party 
swaptions chesapeake sells call swaptions to counterparties that allow them  on a specific date  to extend an existing fixed price swap for a certain period of time 
basis protection swaps these instruments are arrangements that guarantee a price differential to nymex from a specified delivery point 
our natural gas basis protection swaps typically have negative differentials to nymex 
chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
our oil basis protection swaps typically have positive differentials to nymex 
chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract

this gain is recorded in natural gas  oil and ngl sales 
we entered into new contracts which were in an asset position of million 
we settled contracts that were in an asset position for million and we closed out contracts that were in an asset position for million 
the realized gain is recorded in natural gas  oil and ngl sales in the month of related production 
pursuant to accounting guidance for derivatives and hedging  certain derivatives qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
following these provisions  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  to the extent they are effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk  are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings as the physical transactions being hedged occur 
any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness is recognized in natural gas  oil and ngl sales as unrealized gains losses 
realized gains losses consist of settled contracts related to the production periods being reported 
unrealized gains losses consist of both temporary fluctuations in the mark to market values and settled values related to future production periods of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges 
as of december   we did not have any natural gas or oil derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges

changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest we earn on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our revolving bank credit facilities 
all of our other indebtedness is fixed rate and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of fluctuations in earnings or cash flow due to changes in market interest rates 
however  changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
interest rate derivatives to mitigate a portion of our exposure to volatility in interest rates related to our senior notes and credit facilities  we enter into interest rate derivatives 
as of december   our interest rate derivative instruments consisted of one type of instrument swaps chesapeake enters into fixed to floating interest rate swaps we receive a fixed interest rate and pay a floating market rate to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our senior notes

in addition to the open derivative positions disclosed above  at december  we had million of net gains related to settled derivative contracts that will be recorded within interest expense as realized gains losses as they are transferred from either our senior note liability or unrealized interest expense gains losses over the next nine year term of the related senior notes 
gains or losses from interest rate derivative transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations 
the components of interest expense for the years ended december   and are presented below 
years ended december  in millions interest expense on senior notes interest expense on credit facilities interest expense on term loans realized gains losses on interest rate derivatives unrealized gains losses on interest rate derivatives amortization of loan discount  issuance costs and other capitalized interest total interest expense foreign currency derivatives in december  we issued million of euro denominated senior notes due concurrent with the issuance of the euro denominated senior notes  we entered into cross currency swaps to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the euro relative to the dollar over the term of the notes 
in may  we purchased and subsequently retired million in aggregate principal amount of these senior notes following a tender offer  and we simultaneously unwound cross currency swaps for the same principal amount 
as a result  we reclassified a loss of million from accumulated other comprehensive income to the consolidated statement of operations  million of which related to the unwound notional amount and was included in losses on purchases or exchanges of debt  and million of which related to future interest associated with the unwound principal and was included in interest expense 
under the terms of the remaining cross currency swaps  on each semi annual interest payment date  the counterparties pay chesapeake million and chesapeake pays the counterparties million  which yields an annual dollar equivalent interest rate of 
upon maturity of the notes  the counterparties will pay chesapeake million and chesapeake will pay the counterparties million 
the terms of the cross currency swaps were based on the dollar euro exchange rate on the issuance date of to 
through the cross currency swaps  we have eliminated any potential variability in chesapeake s expected cash flows related to changes in foreign exchange rates and therefore the swaps are designated as cash flow hedges 
the fair values of the cross currency swaps are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability of million at december  the euro denominated debt in long term debt has been adjusted to million at december  using an exchange rate of to
