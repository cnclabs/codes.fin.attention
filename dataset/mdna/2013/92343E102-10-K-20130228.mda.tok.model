overview we are a provider of internet infrastructure services 
by leveraging our global infrastructure  we provide network confidence and availability for mission critical internet services  such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services 
our service capabilities enable real time resolution for a number of global tlds  enable domain name registration through registrars and provide security intelligence and cloud based network availability services to enterprise customers 
our business consists of one reportable segment  naming services  which consists of registry services and nia services 
registry services is the registry operator for all 
com  
net  
cc  
tv  and 
name domain names and also operates the back end systems for all 
gov  
jobs and 
edu domain names 
as of december   we had approximately million domain names registered under the 
com and 
net registries  our principal registries 
the number of domain names registered is largely driven by continued growth in online advertising  e commerce  and the number of internet users  which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband  as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third party registrars 
recently  growth in the number of domain names has been hindered by certain factors  including the overall economic conditions in europe and changes to search algorithms used by google and other internet search engines that negatively affect the profitability of certain types of websites  and as a result  reduce demand for new domain name registrations and renewals 
although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in the us  growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us over the long term 
nia services provides infrastructure assurance services to organizations and is comprised of idefense  managed dns  and ddos protection services 
revenues from nia services are not significant in relation to our consolidated revenue 
business highlights and trends on november   the doc approved the renewal of our revised agreement with icann to serve as the authoritative registry operator for the

the revised agreement includes new provisions regarding pricing  indemnification  audit rights and service levels 
the term of the agreement is from december  through november  see industry regulation in item for additional information about this agreement

com and 
net and increases in our

as of december   there was million remaining for future share repurchases under the share buyback program

sales and maturities of marketable securities were billion

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates and policies have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time 
fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs 
the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
however  at times  we enter into non standard arrangements including multiple element arrangements 
as a result  we must evaluate whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the deliverables  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
fair value of financial instruments our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision that is identified as an embedded derivative 
the embedded derivative is accounted for separately at fair value  and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize a valuation model based on stock price  bond price  risk adjusted interest rates  volatility  and credit spread observations to estimate the value of the derivative 
several of these inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 
litigation and contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies are based on management s judgment as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential amount of loss incurred 
a liability is recorded when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these liabilities are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment 
if actual results differ from these estimates  our results of operations could be materially affected in future periods when the contingencies are resolved 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 

table of contents our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal  state  and international tax audits 
we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon 
we consider the following matters  among others  in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts  budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term  the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest  and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances 
if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings  the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
earnings per share we use the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of our convertible debentures on diluted earnings per share 
under this method  only a positive conversion spread related to the convertible debentures is included in the diluted earnings per share calculations 
this is based on our intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash 
a change in our intent and ability would require us to use the if converted method  which could have a material impact on our diluted earnings per share

changes in revenues are driven largely by increases in the number of new domain name registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations as well as the impact of new and prior price increases  to the extent permitted  by icann and the doc 
new registrations and the renewal rate for existing registrations are impacted by continued growth in online advertising  e commerce  and the number of internet users  which is partially driven by greater availability of broadband  as well as advertising and promotional activities carried out by us and third party registrars 
on january   we increased our

net agreement with icann through june  the price of 
com domain names is fixed at for the duration of the new 
com registry agreement through november   except that prices may be raised by up to each year due to the imposition of any new consensus policy or documented extraordinary expense resulting from an attack or threat of attack on the security and stability each as defined in the

com and 
net tlds and a million increase in other revenues comprised of nia services  other tlds  and data hosting services 
the increase in revenues from the

our revenues increased by million in  as compared to  primarily due to an year over year increase in the number of domain names ending in 
com and 
net and increases in our 
com and 
net registry fees in july as per our agreements with icann 
the growth in the number of active domain names was primarily driven by continued internet growth and new domain name promotional programs 
we expect to see continued growth in the number of active domain names in as a result of further internet growth 
in addition  while we expect to see continued growth internationally in both 
com and 
net domain name bases  especially in markets that we have targeted through our marketing programs  recently the ongoing economic instability in europe has limited the rate of growth of the domain name base and may continue to do so in the future 
further  according to published reports  in google made  and may continue to make changes to its search algorithm and pay per click advertising policies to provide less compensation for certain types of websites 
this could make such websites less profitable and we believe has resulted in fewer domain registrations 
moreover  we believe that some first time renewing websites affected by this change did not renew during although growth in the domain name base may be limited by these factors  we expect revenues will continue to increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of continued growth in the number of active domain names ending in 
com and 
net and the implementation of the 
net price increase which will become effective in july 
table of contents mature markets such as the us  where broadband and e commerce have seen strong market penetration  are expected to see decreasing incremental growth rates reflecting the maturing of the markets 
future revenue growth in emea may be hindered due to the unfavorable economic conditions in europe 
we expect to see larger increases in certain international regions  resulting from greater broadband and internet penetration and expanding e commerce as electronic means of payments are increasingly adopted 
presentation of geographic revenues is included in note  geographic and customer information  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
during the first half of  icann began the application process for new gtlds  including new idn gtlds 
the application period closed in may  and new domain name registration opportunities for a portion of the approved new gtlds are expected to be available in we applied for new gtlds including transliterations of 
com and 
net 
in addition  applicants for approximately new gtlds selected us to provide back end registry services 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in becoming the registry for all or any of the gtlds for which we submitted applications or whether any of the applications for which we would serve as the back end service provider will be successful 
we also cannot predict whether there will be any delays in icann s approval process 
for example  icann has stated that it will need to limit the maximum number of new gtlds that may be delegated in a year to  the application process and availability of domain name registrations for approved new gtlds applied for by verisign or verisign s customers  and the timing of revenue generation  if any  from these gtlds is uncertain 
we do not expect to generate significant revenues  if any  from new gtlds before we cannot assess the impact  if any  the introduction of these new gtlds will have on our revenues and results of operations

accordingly  as at december   we reclassified the carrying value of the debt component of the convertible debentures  the related embedded derivative  and deferred tax liabilities back to long term liabilities  and the associated unamortized debt issuance costs back to long term assets 
in future fiscal periods  the convertible debentures related liabilities and assets will be classified as current or long term depending on whether any of the conversion criteria is met or not at the end of that fiscal period 
we believe existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  and funds generated from operations  together with our ability to arrange for additional financing should be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure requirements  and to service our debt for the next months 
we regularly assess our cash management approach and activities in view of our current and potential future needs 
in summary  our cash flows for   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in provided by investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers 
our primary uses of cash from operating activities are for personnel related expenditures  and other general operating expenses  as well as payments related to taxes  interest and facilities 
compared to cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to an increase in cash received from customers  the payment of million of contingent interest to the holders of our convertible debentures during  and a decrease in cash paid to employees and vendors  partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes during cash received from customers increased as the result of growth in sales during  while cash paid to employees and vendors decreased due to a reduction in operating expenses in the increase in income taxes paid in was due primarily to an increase in income tax payments made by our foreign subsidiaries 
compared to cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to higher income taxes payable in  primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business  before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus and a decrease in cash payments to suppliers and employees 
the increase was offset by a decrease in cash received from customers resulting from a decrease in consolidated revenues due to the divestiture of the authentication services business in net cash used in provided by investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to divestiture of businesses  timing of purchases  maturities and sales of investments  and purchases of property and equipment 
compared to the change in cash used in provided by investing activities is primarily due to billion of purchases of marketable securities net of sales and maturities during compared to million of sales and maturities of marketable securities net of purchases in and a decrease in purchases of property and equipment primarily due to the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston  virginia for million in compared to the decrease in cash provided by investing activities is primarily due to proceeds received from the divestiture of businesses in  and the purchase of our corporate headquarters in reston  virginia in  partially offset by an increase in sales and maturities of marketable securities and investments and a decrease in purchases of marketable securities 
net cash used in financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to share repurchases  borrowings from our credit facility  stock option exercises  our employee stock purchase plan espp  excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  and dividend payments 
compared to net cash used in financing activities decreased primarily due to the payment of a special cash dividend in  a decrease in the amount of share repurchases made during  and an increase in excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus in  partially offset by million borrowed under our credit facility in  and a decrease in proceeds from stock option exercises and the espp 
compared to net cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and a decrease in realized excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and vesting of rsus 
the increase is partially offset by million borrowed under our credit facility in and a lower special dividend paid in compared to impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during  and 
table of contents income taxes as of december   we have used the majority of our us federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as such  we expect the amount of cash paid for domestic income taxes to increase in  although this increase is expected to be partially offset by the increasing benefit from the interest deduction related to our convertible debentures 
the interest expense deducted for income tax purposes is based on the adjusted issue price of the convertible debentures which grows over the term due to the difference between the interest deduction taken for income tax purposes  using a comparable yield of  and the coupon rate of  compounded annually 
as a result  the amount of interest deducted is expected to grow each year  while the interest recognized in accordance with gaap  will grow at a slower rate 
this difference will result in a continuing increase in the long term deferred tax liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
if the amount paid in cash or stock to settle the convertible debentures ie  the settlement amount is less than the adjusted issue price  under the internal revenue code and the regulations thereunder  the difference is included in taxable income as recapture of previous interest deductions 
the settlement amount will vary based on the stock price at settlement date 
depending on the settlement amount for the convertible debentures at the settlement date  the amount included in taxable income as a result of this recapture could be substantial  which could adversely impact our cash flow 
property and equipment expenditures our planned property and equipment expenditures for are anticipated to be between million and million and will primarily be focused on infrastructure upgrades and enhancements to our product portfolio 
contractual obligations see note  commitments and contingencies  purchase obligations and contractual agreements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
we enter into indemnification agreements with many of our customers in the ordinary course of business 
we also entered into indemnification agreements with symantec in connection with the sale of the authentication services business 
see note  commitments and contingencies  indemnifications  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
off balance sheet arrangements it is not our business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements 
see note  commitments and contingencies  off balance sheet arrangements  of our notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further information regarding off balance sheet arrangements 
dilution from convertible debentures  rsus and stock options the conversion of our convertible debentures may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders due to the potential number of shares that could be required to settle the convertible debentures 
we have the intent and ability to settle the principal amount of the convertible debentures in cash  but the excess of the conversion value over the principal amount the conversion spread may be settled in shares of common stock 
as of december   there are million shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible debentures 
based on the if converted value of the convertible debentures as of december   the conversion spread could have required us to issue up to million shares of common stock 
see item a 
risk factors we may not have the ability to repurchase the convertible debentures in cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  or to pay cash upon the conversion of convertible debentures  occurrence of certain events related to our convertible debentures might have significant adverse accounting  disclosure  tax  and liquidity implications  of this form k 
grants of stock based awards are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we recognize that these stock based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
as of december   there are a total of million unvested rsus and outstanding stock options which represent potential dilution of 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all rsus vest and are settled 
there were no stock options granted in or in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and rsu programs  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and market risks 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity the interest rates on our revolving credit facility are affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our credit facility 
a hypothetical change in interest rates by basis points would not have a significant impact on our interest expense in our marketable securities consist of fixed income securities which are subject to interest rate risk 
as of december  we had billion of fixed income securities  which consisted primarily of us treasury bills with maturities of less than one year 
a hypothetical change in interest rates by basis points would not have a significant impact on the fair value of our investments 
foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts  which are usually placed and adjusted monthly 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 
as of december   we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 
market risk management the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately billion  based on available market information from public data sources 
the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk 
generally  the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures
