overview we are a biotechnology company committed to developing small molecule therapies for the treatment of cancer 
we are focusing our proprietary resources and development and commercialization efforts exclusively on cometriq cabozantinib  our wholly owned inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases 
on november   the fda approved cometriq for the treatment of progressive  metastatic mtc in the united states 
cometriq is being evaluated in a variety of other cancer indications through a broad development program  including two ongoing phase pivotal trials in metastatic crpc and two additional phase pivotal trials in metastatic hepatocellular cancer and metastatic renal cell cancer that we plan to initiate in we believe cometriq has the potential to be a high quality  broadly active and differentiated anti cancer agent that can make a meaningful difference in the lives of patients 
our objective is to develop cometriq into a major oncology franchise  and we believe that the approval of cometriq for the treatment of progressive  metastatic mtc provides us with the opportunity to establish a commercial presence in furtherance of this objective 
we have also established a portfolio of other novel compounds that we believe have the potential to address serious unmet medical needs 
many of these compounds are being advanced by partners as part of collaborations  at no cost to us but with significant retained economics to exelixis in the event these compounds are commercialized 
as disclosed on clinicaltrials 
gov nct  a phase clinical trial for one of these compounds  gdc xl  which we out licensed to genentech  was initiated on november  our strategy we believe that the available clinical data demonstrate that cometriq has the potential to be a broadly active anti cancer agent  and our objective is to build cometriq into a major oncology franchise 
the initial regulatory approval of cometriq to treat progressive  metastatic mtc provides a niche market opportunity that allows us to gain commercialization and marketing experience at relatively low cost while providing a solid foundation for potential expansion into larger cancer indications 
we intend to advance cometriq through an extensive development program exploring multiple cancer indications including  but not limited to  prostate  hepatocellular  renal  breast and non small cell lung cancers 
we intend to focus our internal efforts on cancers for which we believe cometriq has significant therapeutic and commercial potential in the near term  while utilizing our crada with the nci ctep and ists to generate additional data to allow us to prioritize future late stage trials in a cost effective fashion 
we believe that this staged approach to building value represents the most rational and effective use of our personnel and financial resources 
collaborations we have established collaborations with leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including bristol myers squibb  sanofi  genentech  glaxosmithkline  merck known as msd outside of the united states and canada  and daiichi sankyo for various compounds and programs in our portfolio 
pursuant to these collaborations  we have out licensed compounds or programs to a partner for further development and commercialization  generally have no further unfunded cost obligations related to such compounds or programs and may be entitled to receive research funding  milestones and royalties or a share of profits from commercialization 
as disclosed on clinicaltrials 
gov nct  a phase clinical trial for one of these compounds  gdc xl  which we out licensed to genentech  was initiated on november  in addition  several other out licensed compounds are in multiple phase studies 
these partnered compounds potentially could be of significant value to us if their development progresses successfully 

table of contents with respect to our partnered compounds  we are eligible to receive potential milestone payments under our collaborations totaling approximately billion in the aggregate on a non risk adjusted basis  of which are related to clinical development milestones  are related to regulatory milestones and are related to commercial milestones 
certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for products that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability  particularly with respect to cabozantinib  and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
our financial performance is driven by many factors  including those described below 
limited sources of revenues cometriq was approved by the fda for the treatment of progressive  metastatic mtc in the united states in november we commercially launched cometriq in january we currently estimate that there are between and first and second line metastatic mtc patients in the united states each year who will be eligible for cometriq  and as a result we only expect to generate limited revenues from the sale of cometriq in the near term 
prior to the approval of cometriq  we had no pharmaceutical product that had received marketing approval  and as of december   we have generated no revenues from the sale of such products 
we expect that all of our other near term revenues  such as research and development funding  license fees and milestone payments and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our partners 
our reliance on collaboration revenues is directly reflected in the decrease of our revenues in compared to due primarily to the october acceleration of million of license revenue as a result of the termination of our collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb for xl  or the agreement  and the december acceleration of million in license revenue as a result of the termination in of our collaboration with sanofi for the discovery of inhibitors of pik 
additionally  milestones under collaboration agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
clinical development of cabozantinib we have focused our proprietary resources and development efforts on the development of cabozantinib 
however  the product candidate may fail to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the initiation or completion of clinical trials is difficult  and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of cabozantinib depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
we expect to incur increased expenses for the development of cabozantinib as it advances in clinical development 
liquidity as of december   we had million in cash and investments  which included short and long term restricted cash and investments of million and million and short and long term unrestricted investments of million and million that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
in august  we completed concurrent registered underwritten public offerings in which we sold million aggregate principal amount of the notes and million shares of common stock at a price of per share  generating aggregate net proceeds of million 
in february  we raised million in net proceeds from a public offering of million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the end of however  our future capital requirements will be substantial  and we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  and we may need to use available capital resources and raise additional capital significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by financial covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank as well as other factors  which are described under liquidity and capital resources cash requirements 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if cabozantinib fails to show adequate safety or efficacy in clinical testing 

table of contents notes on august   we issued and sold million aggregate principal amount of the notes for net proceeds of million 
the notes mature on august   unless earlier converted  redeemed or repurchased and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning february  subject to certain terms and conditions  at any time on or after august   we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes 
the redemption price will equal of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the redemption date 
upon the occurrence of certain circumstances  holders may convert their notes prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding may  on or after may   until the close of business on the second trading day immediately preceding august   holders may surrender their notes for conversion at any time 
upon conversion  we will pay or deliver  as the case may be  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  at our election 
the initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of the notes is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock and is subject to adjustment in connection with certain events 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture governing the notes occurs  holders of the notes may require us to purchase for cash all or any portion of their notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the fundamental change purchase date 
in addition  if certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events of defaults occur  the principal of  and accrued and unpaid interest on  all of the then outstanding notes shall automatically become due and payable 
if an event of default other than certain bankruptcy and insolvency related events of defaults occurs and is continuing  the trustee by notice to us or the holders of at least in principal amount of the outstanding notes by notice to us and the trustee  may declare the principal of  and accrued and unpaid interest on  all of the then outstanding notes to be due and payable 
in connection with the convertible debt offering  million of the proceeds were deposited into an escrow account which contains an amount of permitted securities sufficient to fund  when due  the total aggregate amount of the first six scheduled semi annual interest payments on the notes 
the amount held in the escrow account is classified on our consolidated balance sheets as short term restricted cash and investments and restricted cash and investments of million and million  respectively  as of december  we have pledged our interest in the escrow account to the trustee as security for our obligations under the notes 
deerfield facility on june   we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which  on july   we sold to deerfield an aggregate of million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes due june for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
on august   the parties amended the note purchase agreement to permit the issuance of the notes and modify certain optional prepayment rights 
the amendment became effective upon the issuance of the notes and the payment to deerfield of a million consent fee 
the outstanding principal amount of the deerfield notes bears interest in the annual amount of million  payable quarterly in arrears 
in january  we made a mandatory prepayment of million on the deerfield notes 
we will be required to make additional mandatory prepayments on the deerfield notes on an annual basis in and equal to of specified payments from our collaborative arrangements received during the prior fiscal year  subject to a maximum annual prepayment amount of million 
there is a required minimum prepayment amount of million due in january there is no minimum prepayment due in we may also prepay all or a portion not less than million of the principal amount of the deerfield notes at an optional prepayment price based on a discounted principal amount during the first three years of the term  subject to a prepayment premium determined as of the date of prepayment  plus accrued and unpaid interest  plus in the case of a prepayment of the full principal amount of the deerfield notes other than prepayments upon the occurrence of specified transactions relating to a change of control or a substantial sale of assets  all accrued interest that would have accrued between the date of such prepayment and the next anniversary of the note purchase agreement 
pursuant to the amendment of the note purchase agreement  any optional prepayment of the deerfield notes made on or prior to july  will be determined as if such prepayment occurred as of july  in lieu of making any optional or mandatory prepayment in cash  subject to certain limitations including a cap on the number of shares issuable under the note purchase agreement  we have the right to convert all or a portion of the principal amount of the deerfield notes into  or satisfy all or any portion of the optional prepayment amounts or mandatory prepayment amounts other than the million mandatory prepayment required in january and any optional prepayments made prior to july  with shares of our common stock 
additionally  in lieu of making any payment of accrued and unpaid interest in respect of the deerfield notes in cash  subject to certain limitations  we may elect to satisfy any such payment with shares of our common stock 
the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion or in settlement of principal and interest obligations will be based upon the discounted trading price of our common stock over a specified trading period 
upon certain changes of control of our company  a sale or transfer of assets in one transaction or a series of related transactions for a purchase price of more than 
table of contents million or a sale or transfer of more than of our assets  deerfield may require us to prepay the notes at the optional prepayment price  plus accrued and unpaid interest and any other accrued and reimbursable expenses  or the put price 
upon an event of default  deerfield may declare all or a portion of the put price to be immediately due and payable 
we also entered into a security agreement in favor of deerfield which provides that our obligations under the deerfield notes will be secured by substantially all of our assets except intellectual property 
the note purchase agreement and the security agreement include customary representations and warranties and covenants made by us  including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
loan agreement with silicon valley bank on may   we entered into a loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank for an equipment line of credit 
on december   december  and december   we amended the loan and security agreement to provide for additional equipment lines of credit and on june   we further amended the loan and security agreement to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
the principal amount outstanding under the term loan accrues interest at per annum  which interest is due and payable monthly 
we are required to repay the term loan in one balloon principal payment  representing of the principal balance and accrued and unpaid interest  on may  we are required to repay any advances under an equipment line of credit in equal monthly payments of principal and interest 
we have the option to prepay all  but not less than all  of the amounts advanced under the term loan  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment and the interest on the entire principal balance of the term loan that would otherwise have been paid after such prepayment date until the maturity date of the term loan 
we have the option to prepay without penalty any advance under an equipment line of credit other than advances under a single equipment line of credit  which has a prepayment penalty  provided that we pay all unpaid accrued interest thereon that is due through the date of such prepayment 
in accordance with the terms of the loan and security agreement  we are required to maintain an amount equal to at least  but not to exceed  of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan and all equipment lines of credit under the loan and security agreement on deposit in one or more investment accounts with silicon valley bank and certain other designated financial institutions as support for our obligations under the loan and security agreement although we are entitled to retain income earned or the amounts maintained in such accounts 
any amounts outstanding under the term loan during the continuance of an event of default under the loan and security agreement will  at the election of silicon valley bank  bear interest at a per annum rate equal to 
if one or more events of default under the loan and security agreement occurs and continues beyond any applicable cure period  silicon valley bank may declare all or part of the obligations under the loan and security agreement to be immediately due and payable and stop advancing money or extending credit to us under the loan and security agreement 
restructurings we implemented restructurings in march and december as a consequence of our decision to focus our proprietary resources and development efforts on the development and commercialization of cabozantinib 
we implemented additional restructurings in march and may  which  together with the restructurings  we refer to as the restructurings 
the aggregate reduction in headcount from the restructurings is employees 
during the three years ended december   we recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million in connection with the restructurings  of which million related to termination benefits  million related to facility charges  million net related to the impairment of excess equipment and other assets  and a minor amount of legal and other fees 
asset impairment charges were partially offset by cash proceeds of million from the sale of such assets 
our march restructuring charge was primarily related to termination benefits and facility related charges resulting from the closure of our facility in san diego  california  and one of our south san francisco facilities  which took into consideration a sublease that commenced in september the december restructuring charge was primarily related to termination benefits resulting from additional reductions in our workforce 
our restructuring charge was primarily facility related charges that relate to portions of two additional buildings in south san francisco and took into consideration our entry into two sublease agreements the majority of one of these buildings in july as well as charges relating to the short term exit of the second floor of another building in december the restructuring charge was primarily related to termination benefits in may and the december determination to extend disuse of most of the remaining space in one building for the remainder of the lease term 
we expect to pay accrued facility charges of million  net of cash received from our subtenants  through  or the end of our lease terms of the buildings 
with respect to our restructurings  we expect to incur additional restructuring charges of million relating to certain of our south san francisco facilities that we have planned to exit at a future date and which remained in use as of december  these charges will be recorded through the end of the building lease terms  
table of contents the latest of which ends in during the three years ended december   the restructurings resulted in aggregate cash expenditures of million  net of million in cash received in connection with the sale of excess equipment and other assets 
net cash expenditures for the restructurings were million  million  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the restructuring charges that we expect to incur in connection with the restructurings are subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructurings 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles which require us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition historically  our revenues were derived from three primary sources license fees  milestone payments and collaborative agreement reimbursements 
revenues from license fees and milestone payments primarily consist of upfront license fees and milestone payments received under various collaboration agreements 
we initially recognize upfront fees received from third party collaborators as unearned revenues and then recognize these amounts on a ratable basis over the expected term of the research collaboration 
therefore  any changes in the expected term of the research collaboration will impact revenue recognition for the given period 
often  the total research term is not contractually defined and an estimate of the term of our total obligation must be made 
for example  under the agreement with bristol myers squibb  we originally estimated our term to be through august  which was the estimated term of our performance obligations for xl we estimated that this would be the period over which we would be obligated to perform services and therefore the appropriate term with which to ratably recognize any license fees 
during the fourth quarter of  this estimate was extended to april as a result of the decision with bristol myers squibb to complete additional phase trial programs for xl on july   we received written notification from bristol myers squibb of its decision to terminate the agreement in its entirety 
as a result of the termination of the agreement  the estimated research term was revised to end on october  accordingly  we accelerated the remaining deferred revenue balance through the revised end of the research term and recognized million in revenue during the third quarter ended september  and the remaining million in revenue during the fourth quarter ended december  license fees are classified as license revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
although milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the expected research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of a milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
in certain situations  we may receive milestone payments after the end of our period of continued involvement 
in such circumstances  we would recognize of the milestone revenues when the milestone is achieved 
milestones are classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
collaborative agreement reimbursement revenues consist of research and development support received from collaborators and are recorded as earned based on the performance requirements by both parties under the respective contracts 
under the agreement with bristol myers squibb and prior to its termination by bristol myers squibb in as to cabozantinib  both parties were actively involved with compound development and certain research and development expenses 
table of contents were partially reimbursable to us 
on an annual basis  amounts owed by bristol myers squibb to us  net of amounts reimbursable to bristol myers squibb by us for the development of cabozantinib and xl  were recorded as collaboration reimbursement revenues 
conversely  research and development expenses would include the net settlement of amounts we owed bristol myers squibb for research and development expenses that bristol myers squibb incurred in connection with the development of cabozantinib  less amounts reimbursable to us by bristol myers squibb for the development of both cabozantinib and xl in annual periods when net research and development funding payments were payable to bristol myers squibb  these payments were presented as collaboration cost sharing expenses 
reimbursements under co development agreements were classified as collaboration reimbursement revenues  while reimbursements under other arrangements were classified as contract revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
as a result of the termination of the agreement with bristol myers squibb  which became effective on october   reimbursement payments were presented as collaboration reimbursement revenues for the period ended december  we did not record any further collaboration cost sharing expense or collaboration reimbursement revenues under our current collaborations during see note research and collaboration agreements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our agreement with bristol myers squibb 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of intellectual property rights and research and development services 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  in  under our collaboration agreement with sanofi for the discovery of inhibitors of phosphoinositide kinase  we accelerated million in previously deferred revenue as a result of the termination of this agreement on december  instead of the previously estimated research term end date of july clinical trial accruals all of our clinical trials have been executed with support from third party contract research organizations  or cros  and other vendors 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each trial 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled  the number of active clinical sites  and the duration for which the patients will be enrolled in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
we base our estimates on the best information available at the time 
however  additional information may become available to us  which may allow us to make a more accurate estimate in future periods 
in this event  we may be required to record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activity becomes more certain 
such increases or decreases in cost are generally considered to be changes in estimates and will be reflected in research and development expenses in the period first known 
for example  during the years ended december   and  we recorded a reduction related to prior periods of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to our accrued clinical trial liabilities and research and development expenses primarily related to our phase and phase clinical trials for cabozantinib 
the reductions in these expenses were a result of changes in estimates of planned patient visits and additional assessments that will no longer occur or which were subsequently covered by our patients insurance providers  as well as a reduction of our expected obligation in for lab services 
restructuring liability in connection with our  and restructuring activities  we estimate facility related restructuring charges which represent the present value of the estimated facility costs for which we would obtain no future economic benefit offset by estimated future sublease income  including any credit or debit relating to existing deferred rent balances associated with the vacated building 
we derive our estimates based primarily on discussions with our brokers and our own view of market conditions based in part on discussions with potential subtenants 
these estimates require significant assumptions regarding the time required to contract with subtenants  the amount of idle space we would be able to sublease and potential future sublease rates 
the present value factor  which also affects the level of accreted interest expense that we will recognize as additional restructuring charges over the term of the lease  is based on our estimate of our credit risk adjusted borrowing rate at the time the initial lease related restructuring liability is calculated 

table of contents changes in the assumptions underlying our estimates could have a material impact on our restructuring charge and restructuring liability 
we are required to continue to update our estimate of our restructuring liability in future periods as conditions warrant  and we expect to further revise our estimate in future periods as we continue our discussions with potential subtenants 
in addition  in connection with our sublease efforts for our buildings in south san francisco  if we vacate and sublease these facilities for rates that are not significantly in excess of our costs  we would not likely recover the carrying value of certain assets associated with these facilities 
as such  we could potentially recognize additional asset impairment charges  in future periods  if we were to sublease parts of either of these buildings 
if the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note restructurings of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on our restructurings 
stock option valuation our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate  including assessing the likelihood of achieving our goals for performance based stock options  and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data show that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options was expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation expense relating to restricted stock units was expected to be recognized over years 
see note employee benefit plans of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
valuation of debt and equity instruments issued in connection with august offering the notes are accounted for in accordance with asc subtopic  debt with conversion and other options 
under asc subtopic  issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that have a net settlement feature and may be settled in cash upon conversion  including partial cash settlement  are required to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components of the instrument 
the carrying amount of the liability component of any outstanding debt instrument is computed by estimating the fair value of a similar liability without the conversion option 
the amount of the equity component is then calculated by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the principal amount of the convertible debt instrument 
the effective interest rate used in determining the liability component of the notes was

fiscal year convention we have adopted a or week fiscal year that generally ends on the friday closest to december fiscal year  a week year  ended on december   fiscal year  a week year  ended on december   and fiscal year  a week year  ended on december  for convenience  references in this report as of and for the fiscal years ended  december   december  and december  are indicated on a calendar year basis  ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december    and revenues total revenues by category were as follows dollars in millions year ended december  contract revenues milestones research and development funding other contract revenue license revenues collaboration reimbursements total revenues dollar change percentage change includes amortization of upfront payments 
total revenues by customer were as follows dollars in millions year ended december  bristol myers squibb merck daiichi sankyo sanofi genentech boehringer ingelheim total revenues dollar change percentage change the decrease in revenues from to was primarily due to the acceleration of revenues under two collaboration agreements in  resulting in an abnormally large amount of license revenue in and the loss of any license revenues under those agreements in these accelerations consisted of the october acceleration of million of license revenue as a result of the termination of our agreement with bristol myers squibb for xl  the december acceleration of million in license revenue and a million one time termination fee accrued in december as a result of the termination in of our collaboration with sanofi for the discovery of inhibitors of pik 
further contributing to the decrease was a million transfer fee received and recognized in in connection with the transfer in april of substantially all development activities pertaining to xl and xl to sanofi under our license agreement for these compounds 
these decreases in revenues were partially offset by a milestone payment of million received from daiichi sankyo in august related to our collaboration agreement for xl and million in revenue recognized in under our december agreement with merck for our pik delta program 
the increase in revenues from to was primarily due acceleration of revenues under two collaboration agreements in  resulting in an abnormally large amount of license revenue in described above 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in collaboration reimbursement revenue and research funding related to the termination of our agreement with bristol myers squibb and the transfer of substantially all development activities pertaining to xl and xl to sanofi under our license agreement for these compounds 
furthermore  there was a decline in milestone revenue relating to the one time payment received from genentech of million in under a collaboration agreement for therapeutics directed against targets in the notch signaling pathway compared to million received from genentech in under our mek collaboration

clinical trial costs clinical trial expenses  which include services performed by third party contract research organizations and other vendors  decreased by million  or  primarily due to the transfer of xl and xl to sanofi  the wind down of activities associated with xl and the decrease in patient activity for xl trials 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in clinical trial activities for cabozantinib 
general corporate costs there was a decrease of million  or  in the allocation of general corporate costs such as facility costs  property taxes and insurance to research and development  primarily as a result of a decrease in research and development personnel and the exit of facilities in san diego and south san francisco as a result of the restructurings  and the resulting decrease in allocated costs 
laboratory supplies laboratory supplies decreased by million  or  primarily due to the decrease in headcount and other cost cutting measures as a result of the restructurings 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense decreased by million  or  as a result 
table of contents of our reduction in headcount from the restructurings 
we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each of our research and development programs 
we group our research and development expenses into three categories development  drug discovery and other 
our development group leads the development and implementation of our clinical and regulatory strategies and prioritizes disease indications in which our compounds may be studied in clinical trials 
development expenses relate primarily to clinical trial  personnel and general corporate costs 
as noted under overview  we are focusing our proprietary resources and development and commercialization efforts exclusively on cometriq cabozantinib  our wholly owned inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases  and our objective is to build cometriq into a major oncology franchise 
we intend to advance cabozantinib through an extensive development program exploring multiple cancer indications  and as a result  we expect nearly all of our future research and development expenses to relate to the clinical development of cabozantinib 
historically  drug discovery was a significant aspect of our business and consisted of the discovery  optimization and characterization of lead compounds for selection of development candidates with the best potential for further evaluation and advancement into clinical development 
as a consequence of our focus on cabozantinib  since we have gradually discontinued all of our drug discovery efforts except for those funded under our ror collaboration agreement with bristol myers squibb  and intend to terminate these remaining drug discovery efforts when we complete our obligations under the ror collaboration agreement 
drug discovery expenses relate primarily to personnel expense  lab supplies and general corporate costs 
the other category primarily includes stock based compensation expense for personnel working in research and development 
we principally consider qualitative factors in making decisions regarding our research and development programs 
these factors include enrollment in clinical trials for our drug candidates  the results of and data from clinical trials  the potential indications for our drug candidates  the therapeutic and commercial potential for our drug candidates and competitive dynamics 
we also make our research and development decisions in the context of our overall business strategy  which historically included the pursuit of commercial collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development of our drug candidates 
the expenditures summarized in the following table reflect total research and development expenses by category  including allocations for general and administrative expense in millions year ended december  inception to date development drug discovery other total inception is as of january   the date on which we began tracking research and development expenses by category 
while we do not track total research and development expenses separately for each program  beginning in fiscal  we began tracking third party expenditures directly relating to each program as a way of monitoring external costs 
our third party research and development expenditures relate principally to our clinical trial and related development activities  such as preclinical and clinical studies and contract manufacturing  and represent only a portion of the costs related to each program 
third party expenditures for programs initiated prior to the beginning of fiscal have not been tracked from project inception  and therefore these expenditures from the actual inception for most of our programs are not available 
we do not accumulate on a program specific basis internal research and development expenses  such as salaries and personnel expenses  facilities overhead expenses and external costs not directly attributable to a specific project 
nevertheless  we believe that third party expenditures by program provide a reasonable estimate of the percentage of our total research and development expenses that are attributable to each such program 
under our current strategy  we are focusing our proprietary resources and development efforts exclusively on the development and commercialization of cabozantinib 
as a result  as of december   substantially all of our external third party research and development expenditures were spent on this program 
we expect to continue to incur significant research and development costs for cabozantinib in future periods as we develop the program application for the treatment of metastatic crpc 
we also expect to expand the cabozantinib development program to other solid tumor indications  based on encouraging interim data that have emerged from our rdt as well as other clinical trials 
the expenses for the cabozantinib program were primarily included in the development category of our research and development expenses and exclude the impact of any amounts reimbursed by our partners 
we do not have reliable estimates regarding the timing of our clinical trials 
we estimate that typical phase clinical trials last approximately one year  phase clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase clinical trials last 
table of contents approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the particular clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the drug candidate  the clinical trial design and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
in general  we will incur increased research and development expenses for compounds that advance in clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
we do not have reliable estimates of total costs for a particular drug candidate  or for cabozantinib for a particular indication  to reach the market 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and may not result in receipt of the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential product candidates may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses were as follows dollars in millions year ended december  general and administrative expenses dollar change percentage change general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  facility costs  legal patent costs  consulting and professional expenses including other legal and accounting fees  and employee stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses for  as compared to  was primarily related to decreases in facility costs  legal and accounting fees  employee stock based compensation expense  and depreciation and amortization 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in marketing and commercialization activities in preparation for the commercial launch of cometriq for progressive  metastatic mtc and reduced allocations to research and development as a result of lower headcount 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in allocation of general corporate costs to research and development as a result of the reduction in research and development headcount from our restructurings in and  as well as an increase in marketing expenses relating to the preparation for the potential commercial launch of cabozantinib 
these increases were offset by a decrease in facility  personnel and stock compensation costs relating to our restructurings in and restructuring charge total restructuring charge expenses from our restructurings were as follows dollars millions year ended december  restructuring charge dollar change percentage change not meaningful we implemented two restructurings in march and december as a consequence of our decision to focus our proprietary resources and development efforts on the development and commercialization of cabozantinib 
we implemented additional restructurings in march and may the aggregate reduction in headcount from the restructurings is employees 
our march restructuring charge was primarily related to termination benefits and facility related charges resulting from the closure of our facility in san diego  california  and one of our south san francisco facilities  which took into consideration a sublease that commenced in september the december restructuring charge was primarily related to termination benefits resulting from additional reductions in our workforce 
our restructuring charge was primarily facility related charges that relate to portions of two additional buildings in south san francisco and took into consideration our entry into two sublease agreements for the majority of one of these buildings in july as well as charges relating to the short term exit of the second floor of another building in december the restructuring charge was 
table of contents primarily related to termination benefits in may and the december determination to extend disuse of most of the remaining space in one building for the remainder of the lease term 
total other income expense  net total other income expense  net  were as follows in millions year ended december  interest income and other  net interest expense gain on sale of businesses total other income expense  net dollar change total other income expense  net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and investments and gains on sales of businesses  offset by interest expense incurred on our debt 
the change in total other income expense  net for compared to  was primarily due to the increased interest expense as a result of the august issuance of the notes and the decrease in gain on sale of businesses 
included in interest expense for year ended december  was million of non cash interest expense related to the notes and the deerfield notes 
there were no sales of businesses in while in we sold our remaining equity interest in artemis as well as excess xl materials 
the change in total other income expense  net for compared to  was primarily due to the increased interest expense in as a result of our entry into a note purchase agreement with deerfield in june  partially offset by decreases in the gains on sale of businesses  in contrast to the sales described above  in  we recorded gains relating to the sale of our plant trait business and the sale of our cell factory business 
income tax provision benefit income tax provision benefit were as follows in millions year ended december  income tax provision benefit dollar change in and  we recorded an income tax benefit as a result of the enactment of the housing and economy recovery act of  which was extended through in connection with the enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment tax act of approximately million of the provision relates to an adjustment of the refund received in and under these acts after we further evaluated the qualified expenses from which the refund calculation was originally based 
the remaining amount of million relates to a tax deferred revenue adjustment that resulted in a state tax liability due to state net operating loss carryover limitations 
no such adjustments were recorded during or 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  net loss income adjustments to reconcile net loss income to net cash used in operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year to date  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity  payments and loans from collaborators and banks  debt financing arrangements and equipment financing facilities 
we have also financed certain of our research and development activities under our agreements with various collaborators 
as of december   we had million in cash and investments  which included short and long term restricted cash and investments of million and million and short and long term unrestricted investments of million and million that we are required to maintain on deposit with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates pursuant to covenants in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
operating activities our operating activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december  and cash used of million for the year ended december  cash used in operating activities for related primarily to our million in operating expenses for the year  less non cash expenses for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization totaling million and million  respectively 
our operating expenses were largely attributable to the development of cabozantinib 
in addition  we paid million for our restructurings during these uses of cash were partially offset by the receipt of million in cash in january relating to the termination of our discovery collaboration with sanofi in december and the upfront payment received from merck under our pk delta license agreement 
as significant portion of our other revenues were non cash  which was reflected in the million reduction in deferred revenue during the year 
cash paid for interest of million was significantly lower than our interest expense of million due in large part to accretion of implied interest under the deerfield notes and the notes 
the decrease in cash used for operating activities during as compared was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses during those periods 
cash used by operating activities for as compared to increased million primarily due to a decrease in cash received for contract and license revenues  as evidenced by our million reduction in deferred revenue balance during this was due to the acceleration of non cash revenue recognized as well as a reduction in collaboration reimbursements and research funding received due to the termination of the agreement with bristol myers squibb and our collaboration agreement with sanofi 
in addition  there was an increase in our receivables balance relating to our collaboration agreements and a reduction in our other accrual balances due to the timing of payments made to vendors 
these increases in cash used were partially offset by our reduction in operating expenses from million during to million in  and an increase in non cash accretion of implied interest for our deerfield notes and a reduction in cash payments due to our restructurings 
cash used by operating activities during related primarily to our net loss of million 
the impact of non cash revenue  reflected in the decrease in deferred revenues of million was largely offset by non cash charges totaling million relating to stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  accretion of implied interest under our note purchase agreement with deerfield  and impairment of assets due to our march and december restructurings and the 
table of contents increase in our liability for our restructurings totaling million 
operating cash flows also excluded the impact of gains recognized in association with our transaction with agrigenetics for the sale of our plant trait business 
except for  we have been in a net loss position and our cash used in operating activities has been primarily driven by our net loss 
operating cash flows can differ from our consolidated net loss as a result of differences in the timing of cash receipts and earnings recognition and non cash charges 
going forward for at least the next several years  we expect to continue to use cash for operating activities as we incur net losses associated with our research and development activities  primarily with respect to manufacturing and development expenses for cabozantinib 
investing activities our investing activities used cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash used of million for the year ended december   and cash used of million for cash used by investing activities for the period was primarily due to the purchase of million of investments and a net increase in restricted cash of million  primarily in connection with the notes 
these uses were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of investments of million 
cash used by investing activities for was primarily driven by the purchase of million in investments partially offset by proceeds received from the maturity of investments of million  proceeds from the sale of investments before maturity of million and a proceeds of million from the sale of our equity ownership in artemis 
cash used by investing activities for was primarily driven by the purchase of million of investments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of investments of million in addition to the sale of investments prior to maturity of million and proceeds of million associated with our transaction with agrigenetics and the sale of our cell factory business in the proceeds provided by the sale and maturity of our investments were used to fund our operations 
financing activities our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for the year ended december   and cash provided of million for cash provided by our financing activities for was due to the issuance of million shares of common stock in february and million shares of common stock in august for total net proceeds of million  as well as the issuance and sale of the notes for net proceeds of million 
cash provided by our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million from the issuance of million shares of common stock  proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million and the final draw down of million required under our silicon valley bank loan agreement 
these increases in cash were partially offset by cash used for principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
cash provided by our financing activities for was primarily due to funds received under our loan agreement with silicon valley bank  the sale of secured convertible notes to deerfield for proceeds of million  proceeds from the sale of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of million and proceeds from employee option exercises of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and bank obligations of million 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities and other general corporate purposes 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes and bank obligations 
in  we amended our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank to provide for a new seven year term loan in the amount of million 
in addition  we entered into a note purchase agreement with deerfield pursuant to which we sold to deerfield an aggregate million initial principal amount of our secured convertible notes for an aggregate purchase price of million  less closing fees and expenses of approximately million 
in august  we incurred million of indebtedness through the issuance of the notes 
see certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and note debt of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these agreements 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception through the year ended december   with the exception of the 
table of contents fiscal year ended  primarily as a result of the acceleration of revenue recognized under our agreement with bristol myers squibb that terminated in october and under our discovery collaboration agreement with sanofi that terminated in december we anticipate net losses and negative operating cash flow for the foreseeable future 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of million  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of billion 
as of december   we had not generated revenues from the sale of cometriq  which was commercially launched for the treatment of progressive  metastatic mtc in the united states in january we have derived substantially all of our revenues to date from collaborative research and development agreements 
revenues from research and development collaborations depend upon continuation of the collaborations  research funding  the achievement of milestones and royalties we earn from any future products developed from the collaborative research 
if we are unable to successfully achieve milestones  our collaborators fail to develop successful products or research funding we receive from collaborators decreases  we will not earn the revenues contemplated under such collaborative agreements 
the amount of our net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  in our sales of cometriq  license and contract revenues and on the level of our expenses 
these losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity and working capital 
our research and development expenditures and general and administrative expenses have exceeded our revenues through and for the year ended december   and we expect to spend significant additional amounts to fund the development of cabozantinib 
as a result  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating expenses  and  consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve future profitability 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments and funding that we expect to receive from existing collaborators will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following the end of however  our future capital requirements will be substantial  and we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  and we may need to use available capital resources and raise additional capital significantly earlier than we currently anticipate 
these factors include the progress and scope of the development and commercialization activities with respect to cometriq cabozantinib  repayment of the notes  repayment of the deerfield notes  repayment of our loan from silicon valley bank  the commercial success of cometriq and the revenues we generate  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements  the degree to which we conduct funded development activity on behalf of partners to whom we have out licensed compounds or programs  whether we enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements or other arrangements including  in particular  with respect to cometriq that provide additional capital  our ability to control costs  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the amount of our cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments that serve as collateral for bank lines of credit  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  our obligation to share us marketing and commercialization costs for gdc xl under our collaboration with genentech  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies 

table of contents we may seek to raise funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through external borrowings 
in addition  we may enter into additional strategic partnerships  collaborative arrangements or other strategic transactions 
it is unclear whether any such partnership  arrangement or transaction will occur  on satisfactory terms or at all  or what the timing and nature of such a partnership  arrangement or transaction may be 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness  and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
we may need to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in our loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the loan and security agreement requires that we maintain an amount equal to at least  but not to exceed  of the outstanding principal balance of the term loan and all equipment lines of credit under the loan and security agreement at all times in one or more investment accounts with silicon valley bank or one of its affiliates as support for our obligations under the loan and security agreement 
if the balance on our deposit account s falls below the required level for more than days  silicon valley bank may declare all or part of the obligations under the loan and security agreement to be immediately due and payable and stop advancing money or extending credit to us 
if we are unable to remain in compliance with our financial covenants or if we are unable to renegotiate such covenants and the lender exercises its remedies under the agreement  we would not be able to operate under our current operating plan 
we have contractual obligations in the form of debt  loans payable  operating leases  purchase obligations and other long term liabilities 
the following chart details our contractual obligations  including any potential accrued or accreted interest  as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years convertible notes loans payable operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations includes our obligations under the deerfield notes and the notes 
see certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the terms of the deerfield notes and the notes 
includes our obligations under our loan from silicon valley bank 
see certain factors important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations and note debt of the notes to consolidated financial statements regarding the terms of our loan from silicon valley bank 
the operating lease payments do not include million to be received through in connection with the sublease for two of our south san francisco buildings 
at december   we had firm purchase commitments related to manufacturing and maintenance of inventory 
these commitments include a portion of our contractual minimum purchase obligation and our actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
in connection with the sale of our plant trait business  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser and its affiliates up to a specified amount if they incur damages due to any infringement or alleged infringement of certain patents 
we have certain collaboration licensing agreements  which contain standard indemnification clauses 
such clauses typically indemnify the customer or vendor for an adverse judgment in a lawsuit in the event of our misuse or negligence 
we consider the likelihood of an adverse judgment related to an indemnification agreement to be remote 
furthermore  in the event of an adverse judgment  any losses under such an adverse judgment may be substantially offset by corporate insurance 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in december  accounting standards codification topic  testing goodwill for impairment was amended to allow the option of performing a qualitative assessment in evaluating goodwill for impairment 
we adopted this guidance 
table of contents beginning january   and it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurement was amended to converge us and international accounting standards and provide more detailed disclosure 
we adopted this guidance beginning january  and added additional disclosure as required 
the amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in july  accounting standards codification topic  testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment was amended to permit a reporting entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the annual quantitative impairment test for indefinite lived intangible assets 
this guidance will be effective january  we do not expect the adoption of the amendment to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements  as defined by applicable sec regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
as of december  and  we had cash investments of million and million  respectively 
our investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we limit our credit risk by limiting purchases to high quality issuers 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are primarily fixed and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments  or a combination of both 
the fair value of our investments and our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and december  for our investments  the estimated effects of hypothetical interest rate changes is obtained from the same third party pricing sources we use to value our investments 
for debt instruments  we determine the estimated effects of hypothetical interest rate changes using the same present value model we use to determine the fair of value of those instruments 
as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we have exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies in countries in which we conduct clinical trials 
most of our foreign expenses incurred were associated with establishing and conducting clinical trials for cabozantinib and various other compounds in our pipeline at sites outside of the united states 
our agreements with the foreign sites that conduct such clinical trials generally provide that payments for the services provided will be calculated in the currency of that country  and converted into us dollars using various exchange rates based upon when services are rendered or the timing of invoices 
when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of our clinical accrual balance was owed in foreign currencies 
as of december  and  an adverse change of one percentage point in the in foreign currency exchange rates would have resulted in a net loss of million and million  respectively 
we incurred a net loss of million relating to our foreign currency contract that was settled in december we did not record any gains or losses relating to foreign exchange fluctuations for the fiscal years ended december  or
