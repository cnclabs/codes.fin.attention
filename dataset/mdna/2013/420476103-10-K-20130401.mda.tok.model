item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by our bank s asset liability committee and board of directors 
interest rate risk is the potential of economic losses due to future interest rate changes 
these economic losses can be reflected as a loss of future net interest income and or a loss of current fair market values 
the objective is to measure the effect on net interest income and to adjust the balance sheet to minimize the inherent risk while at the same time maximizing income 
management realizes certain risks are inherent and that the goal is to identify and minimize those risks 
tools used by our bank s management include the standard gap report subject to different rate shock scenarios 
at december   the rate shock scenario models indicated that annual net interest income could change by as much as to should interest rates rise or fall within basis points from their current level over a one year period 
however there are no assurances that the change will not be more or less than this estimate
