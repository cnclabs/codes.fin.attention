recent acquisition and divestiture in furthering our strategy to diversify our products offered in the emergency vehicle business  we acquired classic fire on april   as more fully described in note  acquisition activities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
classic fire is a manufacturer of emergency response vehicles and fire fighting apparatus 
the acquisition of classic fire has enabled us to expand our product offerings into lower price points that complement our offerings from spartan chassis  crimson and crimson aerials 
in addition  classic fire has provided strategic sourcing of pump modules and other technology 
on september   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of our road rescue  inc subsidiary  as more fully described in note  discontinued operations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
we believe that our performance has been enhanced by redeploying our resources from road rescue to support our other businesses 
net loss for road rescue  reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations  was million in  the only period presented 
the net loss for road rescue for includes a pre tax gain on the sale of substantially all of the assets and related liabilities of road rescue of million 
executive overview revenue in was million  which reflected an increase of million or from revenue of million 
driving the increase in revenue was a sharp increase in unit volume for delivery and service vehicles  along with increases in emergency response chassis and bodies due to strong order intake for both domestic and international shipments 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales in our specialty vehicles segment  primarly due to lower defense related sales 
gross margin was in  compared to in  which reflects the impact of the restructuring initiatives  which reduced our gross margin by of sales  along with a product mix in that included a higher proportion of delivery and service vehicles  which generally carry lower gross margins 
general and administrative expense for was million  or of sales  compared to million or of sales in  which reflects savings realized in as a result of restructuring initiatives undertaken early in and in prior years 
net loss for was million  or per share  which includes an after tax impact of million for restructuring charges  compared to net income of million  or per share in  including an after tax impact of million for restructuring charges 
the after tax restructuring charges incurred in include approximately million related to the move of our utilimaster production to a new plant location in bristol  indiana 
cash flow remained strong  generating million from operations in  which helped to offset uses of cash from investing activities  primarily related to utilimaster s move to bristol  and financing activities  primarily the payment of dividends 
our balance sheet remains strong with a large cash balance  low debt and access to financing sufficient to fund our initiatives for the foreseeable future 
the following table shows our sales by market for the years ended december   and as a percentage of total sales emergency response chassis emergency response bodies defense and government aftermarket parts and assemblies total government motor home chassis delivery and service other vehicles total business consumer our diversification away from government dependent sales toward business and consumer dependent sales accelerated with our acquisition of utilimaster in november of that allowed us to expand into the delivery and service vehicles market 
we continue to focus on diversifying our revenues by expanding our sales in the delivery and service market  pursuing new commercial opportunities through our alliance with isuzu and pursuing strategic acquisitions that enable us to expand into existing or new markets as opportunities occur 
we are well positioned to take advantage of long term opportunities as a result of our diversified business model 
we believe the major strength of our business model is market diversity and customization  with an expanding product offering in emergency response vehicles as well as delivery and service vehicles 
the delivery and service vehicle market is an early cycle industry  complementary to the late cycle emergency response vehicle industry 
we intend to continue to pursue our ability to react swiftly when challenges arise  as demonstrated by our recent aggressive cost realignment 
we are also able to respond nimbly when opportunities arise  as demonstrated with our past ramp up on defense initiatives 
we remain focused on keeping costs aligned with sales levels and are continuing efforts to identify cost reduction opportunities 
the move of our utilimaster subsidiary to a new  single building facility that will result in greater manufacturing flexibility and efficiency  higher product quality and lower operating costs 
operating in this new facility will reduce the distance a vehicle travels during assembly from miles today to less than one half mile and will eliminate a number of non value added production steps 
the first shipments in the third quarter of of emergency response chassis equipped with our spartan advanced protection system aps  a pioneering blend of industry first airbag and safety belt protections that make occupants safer than ever before 
the aps offers eight airbags  including officer and driver knee airbags and a rear side curtain which is larger than any other system on the road  along with a restraint control module deploying advanced motion sensors around the cab perimeter and advanced seat belts with pretensioning and load limiting 
the re branding of crimson fire  crimson fire aerials and classic fire under the spartan ervtm brand to focus on one brand and leverage the growing strength of the spartan name

the introduction of aftermarket parts and assemblies in our delivery and service vehicles segment  including keyless entry and safe loading systems and shelving 
a new enterprise resource planning erp system that we began implementing in late  with go live for various modules and subsidiaries from through this new erp system will provide information on a more timely and granular basis  which will enable management to make informed decisions using up to the minute information 
in addition the new erp system is expected to result in meaningful cost savings through re engineered and streamlined processes that will impact all aspects of our operations 
we expect sales of our emergency response vehicles to increase in as a result of continuing marketing efforts focused on select markets in south america and asia  which serve to counteract the weak domestic demand experienced in the last few years as the result of tightened municipal budgets 
while there is some risk involving the move of our utilimaster operations to bristol  sales in our delivery and service vehicles segment are expected to remain close to the strong sales levels achieved in  as a result of pent up demand in the delivery and service vehicles market  coupled with increases in reach production 
we expect sales in our specialty vehicles segment to increase slightly as a result of recent strengthening in orders for motor home chassis and the receipt in october  of a small defense order 
we will continue investing in product innovations and infrastructure and operational improvements in  including the move of our delivery and service vehicles manufacturing to a new  single building location and the implementation of a new erp system 
the following section provides a narrative discussion about our financial condition and results of operations 
the comments that follow should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing in item of this form k 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the components of our consolidated statements of income  as a percentage of revenues percentages may not sum due to rounding year ended december  sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative operating income loss other expense  net earnings loss before taxes on income taxes on income net earnings loss from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net earnings loss during  and  we undertook restructuring activities  pertaining to continuing operations  as the result of the planned move of our utilimaster operations from wakarusa  indiana to bristol  indiana and to help align expenses with current and future revenue expectations 
restructuring charges incurred in the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
during the years ended december   and we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of expense due to changes in the fair value of the contingent liability for earn out consideration related to our utilimaster acquisition in the incremental earn out expense incurred in and was mainly due to the achievement of higher sales levels than originally forecasted at the time of the acquisition 
excluding all restructuring costs and expense from changes in the fair value of contingent consideration incurred  adjusted operating income was  and of sales while adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these adjusted non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measures  adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations  are not measurements of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or earnings per share from continuing operations under gaap 
we present these adjusted non gaap measures because we consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance and believe them to be useful to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our operating performance 
these adjusted measures have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under gaap 
in addition  in evaluating adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income  additional expenses may be incurred in the future similar to the adjustments in this presentation 
this presentation of adjusted measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items 
these limitations are compensated by providing equal prominence of gaap results and using adjusted measures only as a supplement 
the following table reconciles operating income loss to adjusted operating income and earnings loss per share from continuing operations to adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods indicated dollars in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  operating income loss add back restructuring charges add back expense from changes in fair value of contingent consideration adjusted operating income adjusted operating income as a percent of sales earnings loss per share from continuing operations diluted add back restructuring charges add back expense from changes in fair value of contingent consideration  net of tax adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations diluted year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated sales for the year ended december  increased by million or from million in to million in  driven by increases of million in our delivery and service vehicles segment and million in our emergency response vehicles segment 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues of million in our specialty vehicles segment 
these changes in revenue are discussed more fully below in the description of our segments 
cost of products sold increased by million or from million in to million in  driven by the increase in sales volume 
restructuring charges recorded within cost of products sold in were million  mainly related to the planned relocation of our utilimaster operations from wakarusa  indiana to bristol  indiana  compared to restructuring charges of million recorded within cost of products sold in cost of products sold as a percent of revenue increased by basis points to in compared to in  mainly due to higher restructuring costs in  which accounted for approximately basis points of the increase 
the remainder of the increase is attributed to a change in product mix with lower margin delivery and service vehicles accounting for a larger percentage of consolidated sales in as compared to gross margin decreased to in from in  driven by the restructuring charges and change in product mix as described above 
operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million to million in from million in increases of million in restructuring charges incurred in  mainly related to the planned move of utilimaster to bristol  indiana along with million in additional charges related to an earn out contingency for the utilimaster purchase were partially offset by savings from restructuring initiatives undertaken early in and in prior years 
income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million to million  compared to million in our effective tax rate in was  compared to in when we recorded income before taxes 
our effective tax rate in was heavily impacted by non deductible expenses  mainly the million utilimaster earn out contingency provision recorded in see note  taxes on income in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for more information on our income tax expense and effective tax rate 
net earnings for the year ended december  decreased by million to a net loss of million in compared to net earnings of million in on a per diluted share basis  net earnings decreased by to a net loss of per share in from net income of per share in net loss in includes an additional million in restructuring charges net of tax impact and million in utilimaster earn out contingency provisions net of tax impact over the amounts recorded in year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated sales for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in the decrease was due to decreases of million and million in revenue in our specialty vehicles and emergency response vehicles segments  respectively  which were partially offset by an increase of million in revenue from our delivery and service vehicles segment 
these changes in revenue are discussed more fully below in the description of our segments 
cost of products sold decreased by million or from million in to million in  driven by the decrease in sales volume year over year 
cost of products sold as a percent of revenue increased by basis points from of sales in to of sales in due to higher restructuring costs in  a change in the mix of products sold and a lower absorption of fixed costs due to the lower sales volumes within our specialty vehicles and emergency response vehicles segments 
gross margin decreased from in to in due to the product mix change and fixed cost absorption discussed above 
operating expenses for the year ended december  decreased by million or to million from million in driven by cost containment efforts  savings from the restructuring activities enacted in the second quarter of  and a decrease in r d spending as the reach neared production 
as a percent of sales  operating expenses increased basis points from in to in  due to the decrease in sales 
income taxes for the year ended december  decreased by million or from million in to million in due to the decrease in income from continuing operations  which was partially offset by an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective rate for increased to compared to in  primarily due to higher non deductible expenses in relation to the reduced pre tax income in  as compared to in addition  the effective rate for was impacted by higher research and development tax credits applied for during that year  compared with see note  taxes on income  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding our income taxes 
net earnings from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased million or from million in to million in as a result of the factors discussed in the paragraphs above 
earnings per diluted share from continuing operations decreased from in to in net earnings for the year ended december  decreased by million from million in to million in on a per diluted share basis  net earnings decreased by from in to in due to the factors discussed in the paragraphs above 
net earnings for the year ended december  included a net loss of million or per diluted share from discontinued operations  representing the loss from operations and gain on sale of our road rescue subsidiary 
our segments we identify our reportable segments based on our management structure and the financial data utilized by the chief operating decision makers to assess segment performance and allocate resources among our operating units 
as a result of a realignment of our operating segments completed during the course of the quarter ended september   we have realigned our reportable segments into three segments emergency response vehicles  delivery and service vehicles  and specialty vehicles 
in this new format  the former specialty vehicles segment  which consisted of our spartan chassis  crimson  crimson aerials and classic fire operations  has been bifurcated into the emergency response vehicles segment and the specialty vehicles segment 
our emergency response vehicles segment consists of the emergency response chassis operations of spartan chassis and the operations of crimson  crimson aerials  and classic fire 
this segment engineers and manufactures emergency response chassis  emergency response bodies and aerial equipment 
our delivery and service vehicles segment consists of utilimaster and focuses on designing and manufacturing walk in vans for the delivery and service market and the production of commercial truck bodies along with related aftermarket parts and assemblies 
our specialty vehicles segment consists of the spartan chassis operations that engineer  manufacture or assemble motor home chassis  defense vehicles and other specialty chassis and distribute related aftermarket parts and assemblies 
for certain financial information related to each segment  see note  business segments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
emergency response vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage sales operating income loss segment assets year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our emergency response vehicles segment increased by from to  due to increases in unit volumes in both chassis and bodies  driven by increased international sales  primarily in south america 
international sales in our emergency response vehicles segment accounted for of revenue in and in there were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our emergency response vehicles segment during operating loss in the segment increased by million due to an approximately million expenditure related to development of our aps advanced protection system airbag system  with the remainder due to the impact of labor inefficiencies as production ramped up to meet higher order volume in the third and fourth quarters 
backlog for our emergency response vehicles segment increased by million or to million in compared to million in  driven by an increase in international sales 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our emergency response vehicles segment decreased by million to million in compared to million in  reflecting the softness in this market due to tightening municipal budgets as well as the impact of orders pulled ahead into and as a result of the engine emissions changes 
there were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our emergency response vehicles segment during due to systems limitations it is not practicable for us to identify operating expenses for the year ended december  for the emergency response vehicles segment 
therefore a direct comparison of the operating income for the years ended december  and for this segment is not possible 
see the discussion of our prior specialty vehicles segment below for further information on our segment results 
delivery and service vehicles income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales operating income loss segment assets year ended december  compared to year ended december  our delivery and service vehicles segment turned in another strong year in  with a sales increase of  driven by higher unit volume  a favorable product mix and increased aftermarket parts and accessories sales 
higher unit volume accounted for million of the sales increase from to  with higher aftermarket parts sales contributing million to the increase as we continued a high level of shipments of our keyless entry systems in the first half of a product mix in that favored higher content walk in vans and truck bodies compared to those produced in contributed approximately million to the sales increase 
price increases  which were mainly the result of higher material costs  contributed million to the overall revenue increase in operating income in decreased by million or from that reported in the main driver of this decrease was million in restructuring charges incurred in  which was partially offset by increased sales levels which resulted in favorable absorption of overhead and fixed expenses when compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  was a strong year in our delivery and service vehicles segment  with sales of million  an increase of million or compared to this increase was driven by the introduction of innovative aftermarket parts and assemblies for the delivery and service market  including keyless entry systems  safe loading systems and shelving  and an approximately increase in the volume of units sold in compared to pricing increases on certain vehicles produced by our delivery and service vehicles segment  which were largely offset by material cost increases  contributed approximately million to the increased sales year over year 
operating income for our delivery and service vehicles segment increased by million to million for the year ended december   reflecting stronger margins as a result of favorable absorption of overhead and fixed expenses due to the volume increases and favorable product mix as a result of the introduction of the aftermarket parts and assemblies described above 
partially offsetting the sales related gains was an approximately increase in operating expenses  due mainly to higher selling expenses as a result of the increased sales volumes 
specialty vehicles the below discussion contains information on our revised specialty vehicles segment  which is comprised of the spartan chassis operations that engineer  manufacture or assemble motor home chassis  defense vehicles and other specialty chassis and distribute related aftermarket parts and assemblies 
income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage sales operating income loss segment assets year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our specialty vehicles segment decreased by primarily due to lower defense related vehicles and parts sales  which decreased by million or to million in from million in 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in motor home chassis sales due to increases in unit volume in compared to there were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our specialty vehicles segment during operating income increased by million in  mainly due to a decrease in operating expense incurred in as a result of restructuring initiatives undertaken early in and in prior years 
we expect revenue for to increase slightly over the result with small increases expected in most of the markets served by this segment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in our specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or to million in from million in this decrease was due to lower defense related parts sales  which decreased by million as government parts buildups for defense vehicles we produced in and earlier have been largely completed  along with lower motor home chassis sales which decreased by million as the motor home market trended away from the premium class a market that we support  and a decrease in defense related vehicle sales of million in as compared to there were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our specialty vehicles segment during due to systems limitations it is not practicable for us to identify general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  for this specialty vehicles segment 
therefore a direct comparison of the operating income for the years ended december  and for this segment is not possible 
see the discussion of our prior specialty vehicles segment below for further information on our segment results 
prior specialty vehicles segment the below discussion contains information on our prior specialty vehicles segment  which was comprised of the operations of our spartan chassis  crimson  crimson aerials and classic fire subsidiaries 
income statement data in thousands year ended december  amount percentage amount percentage amount percentage sales operating income loss segment assets year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in the business units that made up our prior specialty vehicles segment increased by million or from to this increase was mainly due to an increase in our emergency response vehicles business unit where sales increased by million or due to strong unit volume as a result of increased international orders and share gains in the domestic market 
also contributing to the increase was an increase in motor home chassis sales of million or 
partially offsetting these sales increases were decreases in defense related specialty vehicles and aftermarket parts and assemblies totaling million  or 
operating loss in the business units that made up our former specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or in compared to  mainly due to a decrease in operating expense in most of the business units associated with this former segment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales in the business units that made up our prior specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or from to the decreases were led by aftermarket parts and assemblies which decreased by million or to million in as defense related sales continued to decline  reflecting the completion of our large military orders in also contributing to the decrease in sales were a decrease in emergency response chassis of million or to million in and a decrease in emergency response vehicles of million or to million in  reflecting the softness in these markets due to tightening municipal budgets as well as the impact of orders pulled ahead into and as a result of the engine emissions changes 
sales of our motor home chassis decreased by million or to million as the motor home market trended away from the premium class a market that we support 
sales of other specialty vehicles  which include drill rigs  defense related vehicles and other specialty vehicles and chassis  decreased by million or to million in  driven by decreases in defense related sales 
operating income for our former specialty vehicles segment decreased by million or to a net loss of million in  driven by the sales declines described above  which resulted in unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead and other fixed costs 
the decline in sales and related gross income was partially offset by significant reductions in operating expenses due to cost containment efforts and the restructuring activities enacted in the second quarter of  which led to a pre tax reduction of approximately million  year over year 
fourth quarter results historically  our sales levels have varied from quarter to quarter 
for a description of quarterly financial data  see note  quarterly financial data unaudited  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
sales in the fourth quarter of were million  an increase of million or from our sales in the third quarter of the increase was driven by higher sales in our emergency response vehicles segment as a result of the strong order intake we experienced in  along with smaller increases in our specialty vehicles segment due to increased volume in motor home chassis and our delivery and service vehicles segment due to higher walk in van unit volumes 
gross profit in the fourth quarter increased by million  or  from the third quarter  mainly as the result of lower restructuring charges incurred during the fourth quarter  which were partially offset by an unfavorable product sales mix in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter 
net loss in the fourth quarter of increased by million to million in the fourth quarter from million in the third quarter  mainly due to additional expense recorded for the earn out contingency related to our utilimaster acquisition as a result of the increased sales level at utilimaster 
sales for the fourth quarter were million  a decrease of million  or  from our sales in the third quarter of the decrease was driven by a decrease of million or in delivery and service vehicles sales due to seasonal decreases in aftermarket parts and assemblies and walk in van sales related to our customary fourth quarter slowdown due to the busy holiday delivery season 
in addition  in late december we delayed shipment until of certain walk in vans in order to effect updates to meet certain regulatory safety requirements 
these decreases were partially offset by sales increases in our emergency response vehicles segment  which increased by million due to increased chassis sales and million due to increased vehicle sales  along with increases in our specialty vehicles segment of million due to increases in motor home chassis sales 
gross profit in the fourth quarter decreased by million  or  from the third quarter 
this was driven primarily by the seasonal volume decrease in our delivery and service vehicles segment  as discussed above  offset by increases in emergency response vehicle and specialty vehicles sales 
net earnings for the fourth quarter decreased million or from the third quarter 
the decrease in net income was impacted substantially by the sales decline in delivery and service vehicles described above 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases in sales in our emergency response vehicles and specialty vehicles segments  along with lower general and administrative expense  driven by lower research and development spending as the reach product neared production 
we finished with a strong fourth quarter  with sales of million  an increase of million or over the third quarter of and substantially higher than the first and second quarters 
the sales increase in the fourth quarter of was mainly due to sales at our delivery and service vehicles segment  which were up million or more than from the third quarter of  which is attributed to strong fleet sales during the quarter 
also contributing to the increase was a million  or  increase in emergency response vehicle segment sales  which was due to a shift toward higher priced units in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of offsetting these increases was a million or decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of in our specialty vehicles segment as compared with the prior quarter due to declines in motor home chassis sales  which tend to be seasonal  along with declines in aftermarket parts and assemblies and specialty chassis  both of which were largely due to defense related sales declines 
gross profit for the fourth quarter of decreased slightly from the third quarter  due mainly to a less favorable product mix for the fourth quarter  which more than offset the increase in sales volume 
as compared to the first two quarters of  gross profit in the fourth quarter was higher  owing to an increase in sales volume overall  as well as higher volumes in aftermarket parts and assemblies  which tend to carry higher margins 
net earnings from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of of million continued the higher trend started in the third quarter  as a result of the increased revenue and steady gross profit levels discussed above  as well as reduced sg a expense as compared with the first half of the year 
also impacting net earnings from continuing operations in the quarter were research and development tax credits that were recorded during the quarter  which helped to reduce our effective tax rate to for the fourth quarter 
financial condition balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the higher sales levels recorded in the fourth quarter of as compared with the same period in our receivable days sales outstanding increased to days sales at december  as a result of a change in the mix of sales in the fourth quarter of to products with longer receivable terms 
income taxes receivable increased by million or to million at december  due to estimated income tax payments made during  based on the taxable income recorded earlier in the year  which exceeded the liability finally determined in the year end provision 
other current assets increased by million or to million at december  due to the recording of a short term note receivable of million related to the sale of buildings and land at our wakarusa  indiana campus completed on december  also contributing to the increases were a million increase in prepaid fees for trade shows to be held in and million in other miscellaneous prepaid items 
property  plant and equipment decreased by million or to million at december   due to depreciation recorded during the year of million  million due to the write down and reclassification to held for sale of our wakarusa  indiana facility and million due to other disposals 
partially offsetting these decreases were million of investments in property  plant and equipment  mainly related to the relocation of our utilimaster operations to bristol  indiana 
accounts payable increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the purchase of additional engines prior to the emissions changes 
accrued compensation and payroll taxes increased by million or to million at december  due to additional payroll liabilities recorded in  compared to  as the result of the timing of pay periods at the end of december 
deposits from customers decreased by million or to million at december   due to the timing of customer payments received in the last few days of the year and the election of certain customers to make deposits on orders 
deferred tax liability decreased by million or to million at december  due to a decrease in the excess of the amount of depreciation and asset impairment recorded in the financial statements over the amount deducted for income taxes through december balance sheet at december  compared to december  accounts receivable decreased by million or to million at december   due to our ongoing emphasis on cash conversion and receivables collections and a decrease in sales for the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of we reduced our receivable days sales outstanding to days sales at december   a decrease of days from the days sales outstanding at december  inventory levels increased by million  or to million at december   mainly due to a delay in shipments from our delivery and service vehicles segment at year end  as discussed above 
property  plant and equipment decreased by million or to million at december   reflecting depreciation taken in of million  impairment charges against a disused building of million and tooling from a discontinued product line of million  and other disposals of million 
these decreases were partially offset by investments of million  and million for assets related to our acquisition of classic fire 
goodwill increased by million or to million at december  as a result of our acquisition of classic fire on april  accounts payable increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the increases in sales and production activity in our delivery and service vehicles segment 
deposits from customers increased by million or to million at december   mainly due to the timing of customer payments received in the last few days of the year and the election of certain customers to make deposits on orders 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in item of this form k  are summarized in the following table in thousands year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to a balance of million as of december  these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance the company s foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
we generated million of cash from continuing operating activities during the year ended december  cash was generated primarily through non cash expenses of million  which offset our net loss of million 
increases in working capital requirements  including accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes receivable  accounts payable and deposits from customers absorbed million of cash 
for the year ended december   cash generated by continuing operating activities was million primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of million and increases in accounts payable of million and deposits from customers of million from december  to december   as discussed above 
for the year ended december   cash generated by continuing operating activities was million driven by a decrease in inventories of approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the decrease in inventory was part of a focused effort by management to reduce inventory and better align working capital with the reduced sales activity for also impacting cash generated by continuing operating activities in was a decrease in customer deposits and an increase in accounts receivable  as discussed above 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows contained in item of this form k for the other various factors that represented the remaining fluctuation of cash from continuing operations between the years 
we used million of cash for continuing investing activities during the year ended december   mainly for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  which included approximately million for the purchase of equipment related to the relocation of our utilimaster operations to bristol  indiana 
during the year ended december   cash used in continuing investing activities of million was driven by million of cash used in the purchase of property  plant and equipment during and million used for the acquisition of classic fire in april see note  acquisition activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for further information on this acquisition 
cash provided by continuing investing activities during the year ended december  of million was driven by million in cash proceeds from the sale of substantially all of the assets of our road rescue subsidiary in september of see note  discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for further information on this divestiture

critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies and estimates is intended to supplement note  general and summary of accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related statement of income  asset and or liability amounts 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidelines  including those of the sec 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when title to the product and risk of ownership passes to the buyer 
in certain instances  risk of ownership and title passes when the product has been completed in accordance with purchase order specifications and has been tendered for delivery to the customer 
on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions  revenue recognition occurs after the customer has been notified that the products have been completed according to the customer specifications  have passed all of our quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery 
all sales are shown net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs  which historically have not been significant 
the collectability of any related receivable is reasonably assured before revenue is recognized 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for customer accounts that reduces receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we make certain assumptions regarding the risk of uncollectable open receivable accounts 
this risk factor is applied to the balance on accounts that are aged over days generally this reserve has an estimated range from 
the risk percentage applied to the aged accounts may change based on conditions such as general economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts from year to year 
however  generally our assumptions are consistent year over year and there has been little adjustment made to the percentages used 
in addition  in the event there are certain known risk factors with an open account  we may increase the allowance to include estimated losses on such specific account balances 
the specific reserves are identified by a periodic review of the aged accounts receivable 
if there is an account in question  credit checks are made and there is communication with the customer  along with other means to try to assess if a specific reserve is required 
the inclusion of the specific reserve has caused the greatest fluctuation in our allowance for doubtful accounts balance historically 
please see note  general and summary of accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k and appendix a included in this form k for further details and historical view of our allowance for doubtful accounts balance 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  such assets are tested for impairment at least annually  and written down when and to the extent impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of october of each year  or more frequently if an event occurs or conditions change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value 
we have recorded goodwill at our crimson  classic fire and utilimaster subsidiaries 
crimson and classic fire are components of our emergency response vehicles reportable segment  which was determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing under relevant authoritative guidance 
utilimaster comprises the delivery and service vehicles reportable segment  which was also determined to be a reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
we early adopted accounting standards update intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu in the fourth quarter of asu permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
under the amendments in asu  we are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount by assessing a range of qualitative factors including  but not limited to  macroeconomic conditions  industry conditions  the competitive environment  changes in the market for our products and current and forecasted financial performance 
if we elect to bypass the qualitative assessment permitted by asu  or if  after completing the assessment  it is determined to be more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we perform a two step impairment test  whereby the first step is comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by estimating the future cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill relates  and then discounting the future cash flows at a market participant derived weighted average cost of capital wacc 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  we consider current and projected future levels of income based on our plans for that business  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions  and market participant considerations 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered to not be impaired and the second step of the test is not performed 
the second step of the impairment test is performed when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  in which case the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of that goodwill based on a hypothetical allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its underlying assets and liabilities 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
we evaluate the recoverability of our indefinite lived intangible assets  which consist of our classic fire and utilimaster trade names  by comparing the estimated fair value of the trade name with its carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of our trade names based on estimates of future royalty payments that are avoided through our ownership of the trade names  discounted to their present value 
in determining the estimated fair value of the trade name  we consider current and projected future levels of revenue based on our plans for classic fire or utilimaster  business trends  prospects and market and economic conditions 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  wacc and the amount of expected future net cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to differences between estimated and actual cash flows and changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of the reporting units and trade name 
the goodwill of the emergency response vehicles segment of million at december   relates to our crimson and classic fire subsidiaries  which were determined to be reporting units under the guidance of accounting standards codification topic the estimated fair value of our emergency response vehicles reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by as of october   the most recent annual assessment date 
based on the discounted cash flow valuation at october   an increase in the wacc for the emergency response vehicles reporting unit of approximately basis points would not result in impairment 
the goodwill of our delivery and service vehicles segment of million at december  related to our utilimaster subsidiary  the sole reporting unit of that segment 
the estimated fair value of our delivery and service vehicles reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by as of october   the most recent annual assessment date 
based on the discounted cash flow valuation at october   an increase in the wacc for the utilimaster reporting unit of approximately basis points would not result in impairment 
the acquired utilimaster trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
the estimated fair value of our utilimaster trade name exceeded its associated carrying value of million by as of october  the acquired classic fire trade name has an indefinite life as it is anticipated that it will contribute cash flows to the company indefinitely 
the estimated fair value of our classic fire trade name exceeded its associated carrying value of million by as of october  see note  goodwill and intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further details on our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
such events may include  but are not limited to  the impact of the general economic environment  a material negative change in relationships with significant customers  or strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  and other risk factors as detailed in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
warranties our policy is to record a provision for the estimated cost of warranty related claims at the time of the sale  and periodically adjust the warranty liability to reflect actual experience 
the amount of warranty liability accrued reflects actual historical warranty cost  which is accumulated on specific identifiable units 
from that point  there is a projection of the expected future cost of honoring our obligations under the warranty agreements 
historically  the cost of fulfilling our warranty obligations has principally involved replacement parts and labor for field retrofit campaigns and recalls  which increase the reserve 
our estimates are based on historical experience  the number of units involved and the extent of features and components included in product models 
over time  this method has been consistently applied and has proven to be an appropriate approach to estimating future costs to be incurred 
see note  commitments and contingent liabilities  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k for further information regarding warranties 
new and pending accounting policies see note  general and summary of accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this form k 
effect of inflation inflation affects us in two principal ways 
first  our revolving note payable is generally tied to the prime and libor interest rates so that increases in those interest rates would be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  we attempt to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of our products 
however  we generally do not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into our contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as nine months  we have limited ability to pass on cost increases to our customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets we serve are competitive in nature  and competition limits our ability to pass through cost increases in many cases 
we strive to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates and the effect of such a change on outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
at december   we had million of debt outstanding under our variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
an increase of in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading or other purposes 
we do not believe that there has been a material change in the nature or categories of the primary market risk exposures or the particular markets that present our primary risk of loss 
as of the date of this report  we do not know of or expect any material changes in the general nature of our primary market risk exposure in the near term 
in this discussion  near term means a period of one year following the date of the most recent balance sheet contained in this report 
prevailing interest rates and interest rate relationships are primarily determined by market factors that are beyond our control 
all information provided in response to this item consists of forward looking statements
