risk management 
eog engages in price risk management activities from time to time 
these activities are intended to manage eog exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices for crude oil and natural gas 
eog utilizes financial commodity derivative instruments  primarily price swap  option  swaption  collar and basis swap contracts  as a means to manage this price risk 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to financial transactions  eog is a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of hydrocarbons that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions 
under the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and  therefore  are not subject to hedge accounting or mark to market accounting 
the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in revenues at the time of settlement  which in turn affects average realized hydrocarbon prices

all of eog crude oil and natural gas activities are subject to the risks normally incident to the exploration for  and development and production of  crude oil and natural gas  including blowouts  rig and well explosions  cratering  fires and loss of well control  each of which could result in damage to life  property and or the environment 
eog onshore and offshore operations are also subject to usual customary perils  including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 
moreover  eog activities are subject to governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations 
losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce revenues and increase costs to eog to the extent not covered by insurance 
insurance is maintained by eog against some  but not all  of these risks in accordance with what eog believes are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that eog believes to be prudent and commercially practicable 
specifically  eog maintains commercial general liability and excess liability coverage provided by third party insurers for bodily injury or death claims resulting from an incident involving eog onshore or offshore operations subject to policy terms and conditions 
moreover  in the event an incident with respect to eog onshore or offshore operations results in negative environmental effects  eog maintains operators extra expense coverage provided by third party insurers for obligations  expenses or claims that eog may incur from such an incident  including obligations  expenses or claims in respect of seepage and pollution  cleanup and containment  evacuation expenses and control of the well subject to policy terms and conditions 
in the specific event of a well blowout or out of control well resulting in negative environmental effects  such operators extra expense coverage would be eog primary coverage  with the commercial general liability and excess liability coverage referenced above also providing certain coverage to eog 
all of eog onshore and offshore drilling activities are conducted on a contractual basis with independent drilling contractors and other third party service contractors 
the indemnification and other risk allocation provisions included in such contracts are negotiated on a contract by contract basis and are each based on the particular circumstances of the services being provided and the anticipated operations 
in addition to the above described risks  eog operations outside the united states are subject to certain risks  including the risk of increases in taxes and governmental royalties  changes in laws and policies governing the operations of foreign based companies  expropriation of assets  unilateral or forced renegotiation or modification of existing contracts with governmental entities  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations

risk factors our business and operations are subject to many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face  as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently believe are immaterial 
if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained herein  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
unless the context requires otherwise  we  us  our and eog refer to eog resources  inc and its subsidiaries 
a substantial or extended decline in crude oil or natural gas prices could have a material and adverse effect on us 
prices for crude oil and natural gas including prices for natural gas liquids ngls and condensate fluctuate widely 
among the factors that can or could cause these price fluctuations are the level of consumer demand  domestic and worldwide supplies of crude oil  ngls and natural gas  the price and quantity of imported and exported crude oil  ngls and natural gas  weather conditions and changes in weather patterns  domestic and international drilling activity  the availability  proximity and capacity of transportation facilities  gathering  processing and compression facilities and refining facilities  worldwide economic and political conditions  including political instability or armed conflict in oil and gas producing regions  the price and availability of  and demand for  competing energy sources  including alternative energy sources  the nature and extent of governmental regulation including environmental regulation and regulation of derivatives transactions and hedging activities and taxation  the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets  including trading by commodity price speculators and others  and the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures 
our cash flows and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for crude oil and natural gas 
prolonged or substantial declines in crude oil and or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity  the amount of cash flows we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses  our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 
in addition  if we expect or experience significant sustained decreases in crude oil and natural gas prices such that the expected future cash flows from our crude oil and natural gas properties falls below the net book value of our properties  we may be required to write down the value of our crude oil and natural gas properties 
any such asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and  in turn  the trading price of our common stock 
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reserves including dry holes 
as a result  we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 
specifically  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and operating wells  and our drilling operations and those of our third party operators may be curtailed  delayed or canceled  the cost of such operations may increase and or our results of operations and cash flows from such operations may be impacted  as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  such as winter storms  flooding and hurricanes  and changes in weather patterns  compliance with  or changes in  environmental laws and regulations relating to air emissions  hydraulic fracturing and disposal of produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes  laws and regulations imposing conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations and other laws and regulations  such as tax laws and regulations  the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses  the availability of  costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties  including mineral licenses and leases  pipelines  rail cars  crude oil hauling trucks and qualified drivers and related facilities and equipment to gather  process  compress  transport and market crude oil  natural gas and related commodities  and the costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  hydraulic fracturing services  pressure pumping equipment and supplies  tubular materials  water  sand  disposal facilities  qualified personnel and other necessary equipment  materials  supplies and services 
our failure to recover our investment in wells  increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third party operators  and or curtailments  delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third party operators in each case due to any of the above factors or other factors  may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for related discussion of the risks and potential losses and liabilities inherent in our crude oil and natural gas operations generally  see the immediately following risk factor 
our crude oil and natural gas operations involve many risks and expose us to potential losses and liabilities  and insurance may not fully protect us against these risks and potential losses and liabilities 
our onshore and offshore operations are subject to all of the risks associated with exploring and drilling for  and producing  gathering  processing and transporting  crude oil and natural gas  including the risks of well blowouts and cratering  loss of well control  crude oil spills  natural gas leaks and pipeline ruptures  pipe failures and casing collapses  uncontrollable flows of crude oil  natural gas  formation water or drilling fluids  releases of chemicals or other hazardous substances  adverse weather conditions  such as winter storms  flooding and hurricanes  and other natural disasters  fires and explosions  terrorism  vandalism and physical  electronic and cyber security breaches  formations with abnormal pressures  and malfunctions of gathering  processing and other equipment 
if any of these events occur  we could incur losses and liabilities as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to  or destruction of  property  equipment and crude oil and natural gas reservoirs  pollution or other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties as well as clean up and remediation responsibilities and costs  suspension or interruption of our operations  including due to injunction  and repairs necessary to resume operations 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  such losses and liabilities in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable 
the occurrence of any of these events and any losses or liabilities incurred as a result of such events  if uninsured or in excess of our insurance coverage  would reduce the funds available to us for our onshore and offshore exploration  exploitation  development and production activities and could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to sell and deliver our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially and adversely affected if adequate gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities are unavailable 
the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the availability  proximity and capacity of  and costs associated with  gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions  mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions  and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
in particular  in certain newer shale plays  the capacity of gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities may not be sufficient to accommodate potential production from existing and new wells 
in addition  lack of financing  construction and permitting delays  permitting costs and other constraints could limit or delay the construction of new gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities by third parties or us  and we may experience delays or increased costs in accessing the pipelines  gathering systems or rail systems necessary to transport our production to points of sale or delivery 
any significant change in market or other conditions affecting gathering  processing  compression or transportation facilities or the availability of these facilities  including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all  could materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time  our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are produced 
except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  acquire additional properties containing reserves or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  our reserves will decline as they are produced 
maintaining our production of crude oil and natural gas at  or increasing our production from  current levels  is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves  which could in turn impact our future cash flows and results of operations 
we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations  particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety  and could incur even greater costs in the future 
our exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively by federal  state and local governments and regulatory agencies  both domestically and in the foreign countries in which we do business  and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations 
moreover  we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental  safety and other regulations 
further  the regulatory environment in the oil and gas industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and  in turn  materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
specifically  as a current or past owner or lessee and operator of crude oil and natural gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into  and the protection of  the environment 
these regulations may  among other things  impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from current or past operations  subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
moreover  we are subject to the united states us environmental protection agency us epa rule requiring annual reporting of greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
changes in  or additions to  these regulations could lead to increased operating and compliance costs and  in turn  materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
local  state  national and international regulatory bodies have been increasingly focused on ghg emissions and climate change issues in recent years 
eog is unable to predict the timing  scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws  regulations or treaties regarding climate change and ghg emissions  but the direct and indirect costs of such laws  regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect eog operations  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing in the us at the federal level 
currently  the regulation of hydraulic fracturing in the us is primarily conducted at the state level and  in canada  at the provincial and local levels through permitting and other compliance requirements 
any new federal regulations that may be imposed on hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and disclosure requirements and in additional operating restrictions 
moreover  some state and local governments have imposed or have considered imposing various conditions and restrictions on drilling and completion operations 
any such federal or state requirements  restrictions or conditions could lead to operational delays and increased operating and compliance costs and  moreover  could delay or effectively prevent the development of crude oil and natural gas from formations which would not be economically viable without the use of hydraulic fracturing 
accordingly  our production of crude oil and natural gas could be materially and adversely affected 
for additional discussion regarding climate change regulation and hydraulic fracturing regulation  see climate change united states  hydraulic fracturing united states and environmental regulation canada under item business regulation 
we will continue to monitor and assess any proposed or new policies  legislation  regulations and treaties in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
we are unable to predict the timing  scope and effect of any currently proposed or future laws  regulations or treaties  but the direct and indirect costs of such laws  regulations and treaties if enacted could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for related discussion  see the risk factor below regarding the provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act with respect to regulation of derivatives transactions and entities such as eog that participate in such transactions 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
legislation has been proposed that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us tax laws  including the elimination of certain us federal income tax incentives currently available to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs 
it is unclear whether such changes or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the enactment of such changes or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could materially and adversely affect our cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 
a portion of our crude oil and natural gas production may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for various reasons  including  but not limited to  as a result of accidents  weather conditions  loss of gathering  processing  compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues  or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as crude oil or natural gas prices that we deem uneconomic 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted  our cash flows and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third party working interest owners 
as a result  we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties  including compliance with environmental  safety and other regulations  or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties 
moreover  we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects 
in addition  a third party operator could also decide to shut in or curtail production from wells  or plug and abandon marginal wells  on properties owned by that operator during periods of lower crude oil or natural gas prices 
these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs  lower production and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we acquire crude oil and natural gas properties  our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems  to accurately estimate reserves  production rates or costs  or to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our operations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we seek to acquire crude oil and natural gas properties 
although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is duly diligent and consistent with industry practices  reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor may they permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
even when problems with a property are identified  we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 
in addition  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of crude oil and natural gas reserves as discussed further below  actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties 
actual reserves  production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates 
in addition  an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations  particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 
we have substantial capital requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flows from operations  commercial paper borrowings  sales of assets and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and  to a lesser extent and if and as necessary  bank borrowings  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and public and private equity and debt offerings 
lower crude oil and natural gas prices  however  would reduce our cash flows 
further  if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines  we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
in addition  weakness and or volatility in domestic and global financial markets or economic conditions may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings or other borrowings 
a reduction in our cash flows for example  as a result of lower crude oil and natural gas prices and the corresponding adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations may also increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay 
in addition  a substantial increase in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment 
any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 
we have various customers for the crude oil  natural gas and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties  including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions 
domestic and global economic conditions  including the financial condition of financial institutions generally  have weakened in recent years and remain relatively weak 
in addition  there continues to be weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets relating to the credit crisis in recent years  and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk 
these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us  as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 
moreover  our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors  such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions 
furthermore  if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase crude oil  natural gas or related commodities from us  we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable  if at all  due to the geographic location of such production  the availability  proximity or capacity of gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 
we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies  government affiliated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases  properties and reserves and the equipment  materials  services and employees and other contract personnel including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists required to explore for  develop  produce and market crude oil and natural gas 
in addition  many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in certain respects  such as in bidding for drilling rights or in acquiring necessary services  equipment  materials and personnel 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas  such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternative fuels 
we also face competition  to a lesser extent  from competing energy sources  such as alternative energy sources 
reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 
estimating quantities of crude oil  ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex  inexact process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors  made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated 
also  the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable crude oil  ngls and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves  we analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs  many of which factors are or may be beyond our control 
our actual reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance  including any significant revisions or write downs to our existing reserve estimates  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and  in turn  the trading price of our common stock 
for related discussion  see item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves 
weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 
demand for crude oil and natural gas is  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts  among other things  the price we receive for the commodities we produce and  in turn  our cash flows and results of operations 
for example  relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and  as a result  relatively lower prices for natural gas production 
in addition  our exploration  exploitation and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions  such as winter storms  flooding and hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment 
such extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations  including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations  maintenance and repairs  the installation and operation of gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities and the availability of  and our access to  necessary third party services  such as gathering  processing  compression and transportation services 
such extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns may materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in crude oil and natural gas prices and may expose us to other risks  including counterparty risk 
we use derivative instruments primarily financial price swaps  options  swaptions  collar and basis swap contracts to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines  we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in crude oil and natural gas prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts 
in addition  our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
recent federal legislation and related regulations regarding derivatives transactions could have a material and adverse impact on our hedging activities 
as discussed in the risk factor immediately above  we use derivative instruments to hedge the impact of fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices on our results of operations and cash flows 
in  congress adopted the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act  which  among other matters  provides for federal oversight of the over the counter derivatives market and entities that participate in that market and mandates that the commodity futures trading commission cftc  adopt rules or regulations implementing the dodd frank act and providing definitions of terms used in the dodd frank act 
the dodd frank act establishes margin requirements and requires clearing and trade execution practices for certain categories of swaps and may result in certain market participants needing to curtail their derivatives activities 
although many of the rules necessary to implement the dodd frank act are yet to be adopted  the cftc has issued several rules to implement the dodd frank act  including a rule establishing an end user exception to mandatory clearing end user exception  and a rule imposing position limits position limits rule 
we qualify as a non financial entity for purposes of the end user exception and  as such  we will be eligible for  and expect to utilize  such exception 
as a result  our hedging activities will not be subject to mandatory clearing or the margin requirements imposed in connection with mandatory clearing 
however  it remains uncertain whether margin requirements will be imposed on uncleared swaps 
the position limits rule was vacated and remanded to the cftc for further proceedings by order of the us district court for the district of columbia in september the dodd frank act  the rules which have been adopted and not vacated  and  to the extent that a position limit rule is ultimately effected  such position limit rule  could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including costs related to requirements to post collateral  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against the price risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd frank act and related regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund our capital expenditures requirements 
any of these consequences could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 
our business and prospects for future success  including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success  depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 
the loss of any member of our management team  and our inability to attract  motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in other countries and  as a result  are subject to certain political  economic and other risks 
our operations in jurisdictions outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks include  among other risks increases in taxes and governmental royalties  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  loss of revenue  loss of or damage to equipment  property and other assets and interruption of operations as a result of expropriation  nationalization  acts of terrorism  war  civil unrest and other political risks  unilateral or forced renegotiation  modification or nullification of existing contracts with governmental entities  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations  and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation 
the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 
the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
however  certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses into us dollars at then applicable exchange rates 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if the amount has not changed in the original currency 
these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our net operating revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 
terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks  whether domestic or foreign  as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts  could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets 
the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
any such actions and the threat of such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways  including the disruption of energy supplies and markets  increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism  and  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves reserve information 
for estimates of eog net proved and proved developed reserves of crude oil and condensate  natural gas liquids ngls and natural gas  as well as discussion of eog proved undeveloped reserves  the qualifications of the preparers of eog reserve estimates  eog independent petroleum consultants and eog processes and controls with respect to its reserve estimates  see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and condensate  ngls and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates by different engineers normally vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
for related discussion  see item a 
risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
in general  the rate of production from eog crude oil and natural gas properties declines as reserves are produced 
except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves  conducts successful exploration  exploitation and development activities or  through engineering studies  identifies additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced 
the volumes to be generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on maximizing the rate of return on investment of capital by controlling operating and capital costs and maximizing reserve recoveries 
this strategy is intended to enhance the generation of cash flow and earnings from each unit of production on a cost effective basis  allowing eog to deliver long term production growth while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
eog implements its strategy by emphasizing the drilling of internally generated prospects in order to find and develop low cost reserves 
maintaining the lowest possible operating cost structure that is consistent with prudent and safe operations is also an important goal in the implementation of eog strategy 
net income for totaled million as compared to  million for at december   eog total estimated net proved reserves were  million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe  a decrease of mmboe from december  during  net proved crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids ngls reserves increased by million barrels mmbbl  and net proved natural gas reserves decreased by  billion cubic feet or mmboe 
operations several important developments have occurred since january  united states and canada 
eog efforts to identify plays with large reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada 
eog continues to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays  which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eog crude oil and liquids rich natural gas production 
eog has placed an emphasis on applying its horizontal drilling and completion expertise gained from its natural gas resource plays to unconventional crude oil and liquids rich reservoirs 
in  eog focused its efforts on developing its existing north american crude oil and liquids rich acreage 
in addition  eog continues to evaluate certain potential crude oil and  to a lesser extent  liquids rich natural gas exploration and development prospects 
during  crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately of total company production as compared to during in north america  crude oil and condensate and ngls production accounted for approximately of total north american production during as compared to in this liquids growth primarily reflects increased production from the eagle ford shale near san antonio  texas  the north dakota bakken and the permian basin 
in  eog net eagle ford shale production averaged thousand barrels per day mbbld of crude oil and condensate and ngls as compared to mbbld in based on current trends  eog expects its crude oil and condensate and ngls production to continue to increase both in total and as a percentage of total company production as compared to eog major producing areas are in louisiana  new mexico  north dakota  texas  utah  wyoming and western canada 
eog delivers its crude oil to various markets in the united states  including sales points on the gulf coast where sales are based upon the light louisiana sweet lls crude oil index 
as part of its diversification strategy for its crude by rail shipments  in april  eog completed the construction of a crude oil unloading facility in st 
james  louisiana  where sales are based upon the lls crude oil index 
this facility  which received the first unit train of eog crude oil in april  has a capacity of approximately mbbld  of which mbbld belongs to eog 
to support its permian basin operations  eog commissioned a crude oil loading facility in barnhart  texas  in eog believes that its crude by rail facilities provide a distinct competitive advantage giving it the ability to direct its crude oil shipments via rail car to the most favorable markets  including both the gulf coast and cushing  oklahoma  markets 
additionally  in july  eog began shipping a portion of its eagle ford shale crude oil production to gulf coast sales points on the newly completed enterprise products partners lp crude oil pipeline 
during  eog increased production of processed sand at its state of the art chippewa falls  wisconsin  sand plant 
the plant processes sand from multiple nearby eog owned sand mines 
the first unit train of processed sand was dispatched from chippewa falls in january during  eog shipped sand unit trains of approximately cars each to a new eog sand storage facility in refugio  texas  where sand can also be coated for added strength 
from refugio  the sand is shipped primarily to the south texas eagle ford shale 
eog also ships its processed sand to other plays  including the north dakota bakken and the permian basin 
eog resources canada inc eogrc owned a interest in both the planned liquefied natural gas export terminal to be located near the port of kitimat  british columbia kitimat lng terminal and the proposed pacific trail pipelines ptp which is intended to link western canada natural gas producing regions to the kitimat lng terminal 
in december  eogrc signed a purchase and sale agreement for the sale of its entire interest in the kitimat lng terminal and ptp  as well as approximately  undeveloped net acres in the horn river basin  to chevron canada limited 
the transaction closed in february international 
in trinidad  eog continued to deliver natural gas under existing supply contracts 
several fields in the south east coast consortium block  modified u a block and modified u b block  as well as the pelican field  have been developed and are producing natural gas and crude oil and condensate 
in february  production from both the toucan field in block a and the adjacent emz area began supplying natural gas under a contract with the natural gas company of trinidad and tobago 
during the fourth quarter of  eog began drilling an exploratory well in the modified u a block which was successful 
this well and three additional wells to be drilled in will be completed in the first half of in  eog resources united kingdom limited eoguk participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block f 
eog has a non operating working interest in this block 
a successful columbus natural gas prospect appraisal well was drilled during the third quarter of the field operator submitted a revised field development plan to the uk department of energy and climate change decc during the third quarter of and anticipates receiving approval of this plan in the second quarter of the project participants are currently negotiating commercial agreements 
in  eoguk was awarded a license for two blocks in the east irish sea blocks b and a 
in  eoguk drilled a successful exploratory well in its east irish sea block a 
well  in which eoguk has a working interest  was an oil discovery and was designated the conwy field 
in  eoguk added an adjoining field in its east irish sea block  designated corfe  to its overall development plans 
field development plans for the conwy and corfe fields were approved by the decc in march the production platform and pipelines were installed in  and eog expects to begin processing facility installation during the first half of the conwy development drilling program is expected to commence during the second quarter of  with initial production expected in the fourth quarter of in  eoguk was awarded a license for block b in the central north sea where it expects to drill an exploratory well to test a crude oil prospect in late eoguk has interest in this block 
in  eog signed two exploration contracts and one farm in agreement covering approximately  net acres in the neuqu n basin in neuqu n province  argentina 
during the first half of  eog participated in the drilling and completion of a vertical well in the bajo del toro block 
in the first half of  eog drilled a well to monitor future well completions in the aguada del chivato block and drilled and completed a horizontal well in this block 
both the horizontal and vertical wells that were completed are under evaluation 
during the first quarter of  eog plans to complete the monitoring well in the aguada del chivato block 
eog continues to evaluate other select crude oil and natural gas opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous crude oil and natural gas reserves have been identified 
capital structure one of management key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog peer group 
eog debt to total capitalization ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
as used in this calculation  total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity 
on september   eog closed its sale of  million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  beginning march  net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately  million were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures 
during  eog funded billion in exploration and development and other property  plant and equipment expenditures excluding asset retirement obligations  paid million in dividends to common stockholders and purchased million of treasury stock in connection with stock compensation plans  primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities  net proceeds of  million from the issuance of the notes  proceeds of  million from the sale of certain north american assets and proceeds of million from stock options exercised and employee stock purchase plan activity 
total anticipated capital expenditures are estimated to range from approximately billion to billion  excluding acquisitions 
the majority of expenditures will be focused on united states crude oil and  to a lesser extent  liquids rich natural gas drilling activity 
eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for eog business plan includes selling certain non core assets in  realizing proceeds of approximately million  to cover the anticipated shortfall 
eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives  including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities  bank borrowings  borrowings under its billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement facility and equity and debt offerings 
when it fits eog strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog history

the primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well  transportation costs  dd a and g a for compared to are set forth below 
lease and well expenses include expenses for eog operated properties  as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property 
lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain crude oil and natural gas wells  the cost of workovers and lease and well administrative expenses 
operating and maintenance costs include  among other things  pumping services  salt water disposal  equipment repair and maintenance  compression expense  lease upkeep and fuel and power 
workovers are operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient  safe and environmentally responsible operations 
eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas 
operating and maintenance costs within these existing and new areas  as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors  fluctuate over time 
in general  operating and maintenance costs for wells producing crude oil are higher than operating and maintenance costs for wells producing natural gas 
lease and well expenses of  million in increased million from million in primarily due to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states million and trinidad million and increased lease and well administrative expenses in the united states million  partially offset by lower operating and maintenance expenses in canada million and decreased workover expenditures in canada million and the united states million 
transportation costs represent costs associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale 
transportation costs include transportation fees  costs associated with crude by rail operations  the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements  dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements  gathering fees and fuel costs 
transportation costs of million in increased million from million in primarily due to increased transportation costs related to production from the eagle ford shale million and the rocky mountain area million 
dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
eog dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact eog composite dd a rate and expense  such as field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance  economic factors and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause eog composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a of the cost of other property  plant and equipment is generally calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 
other property  plant and equipment consists of gathering  transportation and processing infrastructure assets  compressors  crude by rail assets  sand mine and sand processing assets  vehicles  buildings and leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer hardware and software 
dd a expenses in increased million to  million from  million in dd a expenses associated with oil and gas properties in were million higher than in primarily due to higher unit rates million  increased production in the united states million and trinidad million  partially offset by a decrease in production in canada million 
dd a rates increased due primarily to a proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states million  trinidad million and canada million 
dd a expenses associated with other property  plant and equipment were million higher in than in primarily due to gathering and processing assets being placed in service in the eagle ford shale 
g a expenses of million in were million higher than due primarily to higher employee related costs million and higher information systems costs million 
gathering and processing costs represent operating and maintenance expenses and administrative expenses associated with operating eog gathering and processing assets 
gathering and processing costs increased million to million in compared to million in the increase primarily reflects increased activities in the eagle ford shale million  partially offset by decreased costs in the fort worth basin barnett shale area million 
exploration costs of million in increased million from million for the same prior year period primarily due to increased expenditures in the united states 
impairments include amortization of unproved oil and gas property costs  as well as impairments of proved oil and gas properties and other assets 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term 
when circumstances indicate that a proved property may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is generally calculated by using the income approach as described in the fair value measurement topic of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification asc 
for certain assets held for sale  eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 
impairments of  million in increased million from  million in primarily due to increased impairments of proved and unproved properties in canada million  partially offset by decreased impairments of proved properties and other assets in the united states million and decreased amortization of unproved property costs million in the united states 
eog recorded impairments of proved and unproved properties  other property  plant and equipment  and other assets of  million and million in and  respectively 
the and amounts include impairments of  million and million related to certain north american assets as a result of declining commodity prices and using accepted bids for determining fair value 
taxes other than income include severance production taxes  ad valorem property taxes  payroll taxes  franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes 
severance production taxes are generally determined based on wellhead revenues  and ad valorem property taxes are generally determined based on the valuation of the underlying assets 
taxes other than income in increased million to million of wellhead revenues from million of wellhead revenues in the increase in taxes other than income was primarily due to increased severance production taxes in the united states million primarily as a result of increased wellhead revenues and a newly enacted fee imposed by the state of pennsylvania on certain wells drilled in the state in and prior years and higher ad valorem property taxes in the united states million  partially offset by decreased severance production taxes in trinidad million 
other income  net was million in compared to million in the increase of million was primarily due to higher interest income million primarily as a result of interest on severance tax refunds  an increase in foreign currency transaction gains million and higher equity income from ammonia plants in trinidad million  partially offset by increased losses on warehouse stock million and higher operating losses on eog investment in the ptp million 
income tax provision of million in decreased million from million in due primarily to lower pretax income 
the net effective tax rate for increased to from in the effective tax rate for exceeded the united states statutory tax rate due primarily to foreign losses in canada statutory tax rate and canadian valuation allowances

natural gas derivative contracts volume mmbtud weighted average price mmbtu january  through february  closed march  through december  eog has entered into natural gas derivative contracts which give counterparties the option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates 
such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract 
if the counterparties exercise all such options  the notional volume of eog existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by  mmbtud at an average price of per mmbtu for the period from march  through december  in july  eog settled its natural gas financial price swap contracts for the period january  through december  and received proceeds of million 
in connection with these contracts  the counterparties retain an option of entering into derivative contracts at future dates 
such options are exercisable monthly up until the settlement date of each monthly contract 
if the counterparties exercise all such options  the notional volume of eog existing natural gas derivative contracts will increase by  mmbtud at an average price of per mmbtu for each month of financing eog debt to total capitalization ratio was at december   compared to at december  as used in this calculation  total capitalization represents the sum of total current and long term debt and total stockholders equity 
during  the principal amount of total debt outstanding increased  million to  million at december   from  million at december  the estimated fair value of eog debt at december  and was  million and  million  respectively 
the estimated fair value of debt was based upon quoted market prices and  where such prices were not available  other observable inputs regarding interest rates available to eog at year end 
eog debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
while changes in interest rates affect the fair value of eog debt  such changes do not expose eog to material fluctuations in earnings or cash flow 
during  eog entered into a capital lease transaction for the use of newly constructed crude oil storage tanks in the eagle ford shale 
at december   the capital lease liability totaled million 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
during  eog utilized cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from the issuance of the notes as further described below  proceeds from asset sales and cash provided by borrowings from its commercial paper program to fund its capital programs 
while eog maintains a billion commercial paper program  the maximum outstanding at any time during was million  and the amount outstanding at year end was zero 
the maximum amount outstanding under uncommitted credit facilities during was million with zero outstanding at year end 
the average borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and the uncommitted credit facilities were million and thousand  respectively  during the year eog considers this excess availability  which is backed by its billion senior unsecured revolving credit agreement described in note to consolidated financial statements  to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 
on september   eog closed its sale of billion aggregate principal amount of the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  beginning march  net proceeds from the notes offering of approximately  million were used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of outstanding commercial paper borrowings and funding of capital expenditures 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes eog contractual obligations at december   in thousands contractual obligations total beyond current and long term debt capital lease non cancelable operating leases interest payments on long term debt and capital lease transportation and storage service commitments drilling rig commitments seismic purchase obligations fracturing services obligations other purchase obligations total contractual obligations this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  eog pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement  abandonment and asset retirement obligations see notes  and  respectively  to consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current transportation and storage rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 
eog expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment for example  pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities or partnerships  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other off balance sheet arrangement as defined in item a ii of regulation s k during any of the periods covered by this report  and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad  the united kingdom  china and argentina 
the foreign currency most significant to eog operations during was the canadian dollar 
the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog canadian subsidiaries 
however  since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of its canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of the derivatives and hedging topic of the asc 
under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the foreign currency swap of million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in an increase of million to accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook pricing 
crude oil and natural gas prices have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
as a result of the many uncertainties associated with the world political environment  the availabilities of other worldwide energy supplies and the relative competitive relationships of the various energy sources in the view of consumers  eog is unable to predict what changes may occur in crude oil and condensate  ngls  natural gas  ammonia and methanol prices in the future 
the market price of crude oil and condensate  ngls and natural gas in will impact the amount of cash generated from operating activities  which will in turn impact eog financial position 
see item a 
risk factors 
including the impact of eog crude oil derivative contracts exclusive of options and based on eog tax position  eog price sensitivity in for each per barrel increase or decrease in wellhead crude oil and condensate price  combined with the estimated change in ngls price  is approximately million for net income and million for cash flows from operating activities 
including the impact of eog natural gas derivative contracts and based on eog tax position and the portion of eog anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog price sensitivity for each per mcf increase or decrease in wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and million for cash flows from operating activities 
for information regarding eog crude oil and natural gas financial commodity derivative contracts at february   see derivative transactions above 
capital 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states 
in particular  eog will be focused on united states crude oil drilling activity in its eagle ford  bakken and three forks plays and  to a lesser extent  liquids rich natural gas drilling 
united states natural gas drilling activity will be limited to that necessary to hold acreage  primarily in the marcellus 
in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities 
the total anticipated capital expenditures of to billion  excluding acquisitions  is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog strategy of funding its exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow and the sale of certain non core assets 
eog expects capital expenditures to be greater than cash flow from operating activities for eog business plan includes selling certain non core assets in  realizing proceeds of approximately million  to cover the anticipated shortfall 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to financing alternatives  including borrowings under its commercial paper program and other uncommitted credit facilities  bank borrowings  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and equity and debt offerings 
operations 
eog expects to increase overall production in by over levels 
total liquids production is expected to increase by  comprised of an increase in crude oil and condensate and ngls production of and  respectively 
north american natural gas production is expected to decrease by from levels 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their application 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves in accordance with united states securities and exchange commission regulations  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate  ngls and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
for related discussion  see item a 
risk factors and supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been discovered when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
as of december  and  eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note to consolidated financial statements 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of crude oil and natural gas  are capitalized 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of eog calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease  respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
oil and gas properties are grouped in accordance with the provisions of the extractive industries oil and gas topic of the asc 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments 
depreciation and amortization of other property  plant and equipment is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are amortized over the lease term and analyzed on a property by property basis for any impairment in value 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive is amortized over the remaining lease term 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
when circumstances indicate that proved oil and gas properties may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is generally calculated using the income approach described in the fair value measurement topic of the asc 
in certain instances  eog utilizes accepted bids as the basis for determining fair value 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows require significant judgment 
crude oil and natural gas prices have exhibited significant volatility in the past  and eog expects that volatility to continue in the future 
during the past five years  west texas intermediate crude oil spot prices have fluctuated from approximately per barrel to per barrel and henry hub natural gas spot prices have ranged from approximately per mmbtu to per mmbtu 
eog proved reserves estimates  including the timing of future production  are also subject to significant judgment  and are frequently revised upwards and downwards as more information becomes available 
in the future  if actual crude oil and or natural gas prices and or actual production diverge negatively from eog current estimates  impairment charges may be necessary 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability approach 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
eog assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and recognizes valuation allowances as appropriate 
significant assumptions used in estimating future taxable income include future oil and gas prices and changes in tax rates 
changes in such assumptions could materially affect the recognized amounts of valuation allowances 
stock based compensation in accounting for stock based compensation  judgments and estimates are made regarding  among other things  the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies 
assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog common stock  the level of risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields on eog common stock  the expected term of the awards  expected volatility of the price of shares of eog peer companies and other valuation inputs are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
