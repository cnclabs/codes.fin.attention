item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations product and pipeline developments 
forxiga was internally discovered and we have a worldwide codevelopment and cocommercialization agreement with astrazeneca for dapagliflozin 
we own a patent covering dapagliflozin as composition of matter that expires in october in the us and may in the eu 
we manufacture the bulk requirements for dapagliflozin and finish the product in our own facilities 
research and development we invest heavily in research and development r d because we believe it is critical to our long term competitiveness 
we have major r d facilities in princeton  hopewell and new brunswick  new jersey  and wallingford  connecticut 
pharmaceutical research and development is also carried out at various other facilities throughout the world  including in belgium  the uk  india and other sites in the us we supplement our internal drug discovery and development programs with alliances and collaborative agreements 
these agreements bring new products into the pipeline and help us remain on the cutting edge of technology in the search for novel medicines 
in drug development  we engage the services of physicians  hospitals  medical schools and other research organizations worldwide to conduct clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of new products 
management continues to emphasize leadership  innovation  productivity and quality as strategies for success in our research and development activities 
we concentrate our biopharmaceutical research and development efforts in the following disease areas with significant unmet medical need affective psychiatric disorders  alzheimer s dementia  cardiovascular  diabetes  hepatitis  hiv acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids  oncology  immunologic disorders and fibrotic disease 
we also continue to analyze and may selectively pursue promising leads in other areas 
in addition to discovering and developing new molecular entities  we look for ways to expand the value of existing products through new indications and formulations that can provide additional benefits to patients 
in order for a new drug to reach the market  industry practice and government regulations in the us  the eu and most foreign countries provide for the determination of a drug s effectiveness and safety through preclinical tests and controlled clinical evaluation 
the clinical development of a potential new drug includes phase i  phase ii and phase iii clinical trials that have been designed specifically to support a new drug application for a particular indication  assuming the trials are successful 
phase i clinical trials involve a small number of healthy patients or patients suffering from the indicated disease to test for safety and proper dosing 
phase ii clinical trials involve a larger patient population to investigate side effects  efficacy  and optimal dosage of the drug candidate 
phase iii clinical trials are conducted to confirm phase ii results in a significantly larger patient population over a longer term and to provide reliable and conclusive data regarding the safety and efficacy of a drug candidate 
the r d process typically takes thirteen years or longer  with nearly three years often spent in phase iii  or late stage  development 
we consider our r d programs in phase iii  or late stage development  to be our significant r d programs 
these programs include both investigational compounds in phase iii development for initial indications and marketed products that are in phase iii development for additional indications or formulations 
drug development is time consuming  expensive and risky 
on average  only about one in  chemical compounds discovered by pharmaceutical industry researchers proves to be both medically effective and safe enough to become an approved medicine 
drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process  and even late stage product candidates sometimes fail to receive regulatory approval 
according to the kmr group  based on industry success rates from  approximately of the compounds that enter phase i development fail to achieve regulatory approval 
the failure rate for compounds that enter phase ii development is approximately and for compounds that enter phase iii development  it is approximately 
total research and development expenses include the costs of discovery research  preclinical development  early and late clinical development and drug formulation  as well as post commercialization and medical support of marketed products  proportionate allocations of enterprise wide costs  and other appropriate costs 
research and development spending was billion in  billion in and billion in and includes payments under third party collaborations and contracts 
at the end of  we employed approximately  people in r d activities  including a substantial number of physicians  scientists holding graduate or postgraduate degrees and higher skilled technical personnel 
we manage our r d programs on a portfolio basis  investing resources in each stage of research and development from early discovery through late stage development 
we continually evaluate our portfolio of r d assets to ensure that there is an appropriate balance of early stage and late stage programs to support the future growth of the company 
spending on our late stage development programs represents approximately of our annual r d expenses 
no individual investigational compound or marketed product represented or more of our r d expenses in any of the last three years 
listed below are several late stage investigational compounds that we have in phase iii clinical trials for at least one potential indication 
whether or not any of these or our other investigational compounds ultimately becomes one of our marketed products depends on the results of clinical studies  the competitive landscape of the potential product s market and the manufacturing processes necessary to produce the potential product on a commercial scale  among other factors 
however  as noted above  there can be no assurance that we will seek regulatory approval of any of these compounds or that  if such approval is sought  it will be obtained 
there is also no assurance that a compound that is approved will be commercially successful 
at this stage of development  we cannot determine all intellectual property issues or all the patent protection that may  or may not  be available for these investigational compounds

these alliances and collaborations include licensing arrangements  codevelopment and comarketing agreements  copromotion arrangements and joint ventures 
such alliances and arrangements reduce the risk of incurring all research and development expenses for compounds that do not lead to revenue generating products 
however  profitability on alliance products are generally lower because profits from alliance products are shared with our alliance partners 
we actively pursue such arrangements and view alliances as an important complement to our own discovery and development activities 
each of our strategic alliances and arrangements with third parties who own the rights to manufacture  market and or sell pharmaceutical products contain customary early termination provisions typically found in agreements of this kind and are generally based on the other party s material breach or bankruptcy voluntary or involuntary and product safety concerns 
the amount of notice required for early termination generally ranges from immediately upon notice to days after receipt of notice 
termination immediately upon notice is generally available where the other party files a voluntary bankruptcy petition or if a material safety issue arises with a product such that the medical risk benefit is incompatible with the welfare of patients to continue to develop or commercialize this product 
termination upon to days notice is generally available where an involuntary bankruptcy petition has been filed and has not been dismissed or a material breach by the other party has occurred and not been cured 
a number of alliance agreements also permit the collaborator or us to terminate without cause  typically exercisable with substantial advance written notice and often exercisable only after a specified period of time has elapsed after the collaboration agreement is signed 
our strategic alliances and arrangements typically do not otherwise contain provisions that provide the other party the right to terminate the alliance on short notice 
in general  we do not retain any rights to a product brought to an alliance by another party or to the other party s intellectual property after an alliance terminates 
the loss of rights to one or more products that are marketed and sold by us pursuant to a strategic alliance arrangement could be material to our results of operations and cash flows  and  in the case of plavix or abilify  could be material to our financial condition and liquidity 
as is customary in the pharmaceutical industry  the terms of our strategic alliances and arrangements generally are co extensive with the exclusivity period and may vary on a country by country basis 
our most significant current alliances and arrangements for both currently marketed products and investigational compounds are described below 
current marketed products in licensed sanofi in september  bms and sanofi restructured the terms of the codevelopment and cocommercialization agreements discussed below 
effective as of january   subject in certain countries to the receipt of regulatory approvals  sanofi will assume the worldwide operations of the alliance with the exception of plavix for the us and puerto rico 
the alliance for plavix in these two markets will continue unchanged through december under the same terms as in the original alliance arrangements 
bms will return to sanofi its rights and receive quarterly royalties from january  until december  and a terminal payment from sanofi of million at the end of all ongoing disputes between the companies have been resolved  including a one time payment of million by bms to sanofi related to the avalide supply disruption in the us in accrued for in pursuant to the master restructuring agreement  the company will  through various mechanisms depending on the territory  return to sanofi its rights for clopidogrel and irbesartan in all markets with the exception of clopidogrel in the us and puerto rico  where the company will continue to act as the operating partner and own a majority controlling interest 
all currently existing local arrangements in territory a and territory b with the exception of clopidogrel in the us and puerto rico  will be terminated by mutual agreement 
no products will continue to be sold through such local country entities in these territories 
in addition  sanofi will assume all marketing authorizations for the products  to the extent currently held by the company or any of its affiliates 
as a result  sanofi will assume control of all activities relating to the distribution  commercialization and medical affairs of clopidogrel and irbesartan in these regions 
pursuant to the master restructuring agreement and related alliance agreements  sanofi will assume the company s manufacturing and supply obligations of irbesartan products at the end of the company does not manufacture bulk clopidogrel and will no longer finish clopidogrel products in its facilities 
the company will retain rights to the intellectual property developed by the alliance necessary to fulfill its continuing obligations under the alliance arrangements 
under the master restructuring agreement and related alliance agreements  the alliance will remain in effect through december until sanofi s payment of the terminal fee  with the exception of the us and puerto rico  where the alliance will remain in effect through december we had agreements with sanofi for the codevelopment and cocommercialization of avapro avalide and plavix 
avapro avalide is copromoted in certain countries outside the us under the tradename aprovel coaprovel and comarketed in certain countries outside the us by us under the tradename karvea karvezide 
plavix was copromoted in certain countries outside the us under the tradename plavix and comarketed in certain countries outside the us by us under the tradename iscover 
prior to  the worldwide alliance operated under the framework of two geographic territories  one covering certain european and asian countries  referred to as territory a  and one covering the us  puerto rico  canada  australia and certain latin american countries  referred to as territory b 
territory b was managed by two separate sets of agreements one for plavix in the us and puerto rico and both products in australia  mexico  brazil  colombia and argentina and a separate set of agreements for avapro avalide in the us and puerto rico only 
within each territory  a territory partnership existed to supply finished product to each country within the territory and to manage or contract for certain central expenses such as marketing  research and development and royalties 
countries within territories a and b were structured so that our local affiliate and sanofi s local affiliate either comarket separate brands ie  each affiliate operated independently and competed with the other by selling the same product under different trademarks  or copromoted a single brand ie  the same product under the same trademark 
within territory a  the comarketing countries include germany  spain  italy irbesartan only  greece and china clopidogrel bisulfate only 
we sold iscover and karvea karvezide and sanofi sold plavix and aprovel coaprovel in these countries  except china  where we retained the right to  but did not currently comarket iscover 
the company and sanofi copromoted plavix and aprovel coaprovel in france  the uk  belgium  netherlands  switzerland and portugal 
in addition  the company and sanofi copromoted plavix in austria  italy  ireland  denmark  finland  norway  sweden  taiwan  south korea and hong kong  and aprovel coaprovel in certain french export countries 
in and prior  the company and sanofi also copromoted plavix in singapore 
sanofi acted as the operating partner for territory a and owned a financial controlling interest in this territory 
our ownership interest in this territory was 
we accounted for the investment in partnership entities in territory a under the equity method and recognized our share of the results in equity in net income of affiliates 
our share of net income from these partnership entities before taxes was million in  million in and million in within territory b  the company and sanofi copromoted plavix and avapro avalide in the us  canada and puerto rico 
the other territory b countries  australia  mexico  brazil  colombia clopidogrel bisulfate only and argentina were comarketing countries 
we act as the operating partner for territory b and owned a majority controlling interest in this territory 
as such  we consolidated all partnership results in territory b and recognized sanofi s share of the results as net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest  net of taxes  which was million in   million in and  million in we recognized net sales in territory b and territory a comarketing countries of billion in  billion in and billion in the territory partnerships were governed by a series of committees with enumerated functions  powers and responsibilities 
each territory had two senior committees which have final decision making authority with respect to that territory as to the enumerated functions  powers and responsibilities within their jurisdictions 
the alliance arrangements may be terminated by sanofi or us  either in whole or in any affected country or territory  depending on the circumstances  in the event of i voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency  which in the case of involuntary bankruptcy continues for days or an order or decree approving same continues unstayed and in effect for days  ii a material breach of an obligation under a major alliance agreement that remains uncured for days following notice of the breach except where commencement and diligent prosecution of cure has occurred within days after notice  iii deadlocks of one of the senior committees which render the continued commercialization of the product impossible in a given country or territory  iv an increase in the combined cost of goods and royalty which exceeds a specified percentage of the net selling price of the product  or v a good faith determination by the terminating party that commercialization of a product should be terminated for reasons of patient safety 
in the case of each of these termination rights  the agreements included provisions for the termination of the relevant alliance with respect to the applicable product in the applicable country or territory or  in the case of a termination due to bankruptcy or insolvency or material breach  both products in the applicable territory 
each of these termination procedures was slightly different  however  in all events  we could lose all rights to either or both products  as applicable  in the relevant country or territory even in the case of a bankruptcy or insolvency or material breach where we are not the defaulting party
