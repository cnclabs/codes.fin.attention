table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  diebold  incorporated and subsidiaries unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the company esp is consistent with the objective of determining vsoe  which is the price at which we would expect to transact on a stand alone sale of the deliverable 
the determination of esp is based on applying significant judgment to weigh a variety of company specific factors including our pricing practices  customer volume  geography  internal costs and gross margin objectives  information gathered from experience in customer negotiations  recent technological trends and competitive landscape 
in contracts that involve multiple deliverables  maintenance services are typically accounted for under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
there have been no material changes to these estimates for the periods presented and the company believes that these estimates generally should not be subject to significant changes in the future 
however  changes to deliverables in future arrangements could materially impact the amount of earned or deferred revenue 
for sales of software  which excludes software required for the equipment to operate as intended  the company applies the software revenue recognition principles within fasb asc  software revenue recognition 
for software and software related deliverables software elements  the company allocates revenue based upon the relative fair value of these deliverables as determined by vsoe 
if the company cannot obtain vsoe for any undelivered software element  revenue is deferred until all deliverables have been delivered or until vsoe can be determined for any remaining undelivered software elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  but fair value evidence exists for the undelivered software elements  the company uses the residual method to recognize revenue 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement consideration is allocated to the delivered elements and recognized as revenue 
determination of amounts deferred for software support requires judgment about whether the deliverables can be divided into more than one unit of accounting and whether the separate deliverables have value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
there have been no material changes to these deliverables for the periods presented 
however  changes to deliverables in future arrangements and the ability to establish vsoe could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
allowances for credit losses the company maintains allowances for potential credit losses  and such losses have been minimal and within management s expectations 
since the company s receivable balance is concentrated primarily in the financial and government sectors  an economic downturn in these sectors could result in higher than expected credit losses 
the concentration of credit risk in the company s trade receivables with respect to financial and government customers is largely mitigated by the company s credit evaluation process and the geographical dispersion of sales transactions from a large number of individual customers 
inventory reserves at each reporting period  the company identifies and writes down its excess and obsolete inventories to net realizable value based on usage forecasts  order volume and inventory aging 
with the development of new products  the company also rationalizes its product offerings and will write down discontinued product to the lower of cost or net realizable value 
goodwill goodwill is the cost in excess of the net assets of acquired businesses refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company tests all existing goodwill at least annually as of november for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
the company tests for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value of a reporting unit below its reported amount 
the company s reporting units are defined as domestic and canada  brazil  latin america  asia pacific  and europe  middle east and africa emea 
each year  the company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
in evaluating whether it is more likely than not the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the company considers the following events and circumstances  among others  if applicable a macroeconomic conditions such as general economic conditions  limitations on accessing capital or other developments in equity and credit markets  b industry and market considerations such as competition  multiples or metrics and changes in the market for the company products and services or regulatory and political environments  c cost factors such as raw materials  labor or other costs  d overall financial performance such as cash flows  actual and planned revenue and earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods  e other relevant events such as changes in key personnel  strategy or customers  f changes in the composition of a reporting unit assets or expected sales of all or a portion of a reporting unit  and g any sustained decrease in share price 
if the company qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  or if management elects to perform a quantitative assessment of goodwill  a two step impairment test is used to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of any impairment loss to be recognized 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair value is determined based upon discounted 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december  diebold  incorporated and subsidiaries unaudited dollars in thousands  except per share amounts estimated future cash flows as well as the market approach or guideline public company method 
the company s step impairment test of goodwill of a reporting unit is based upon the fair value of the reporting unit  defined as the price that would be received to sell the net assets or transfer the net liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the assessment date 
in the event that the net carrying amount exceeds the fair value  a step test must be performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill must be estimated to determine if it is less than its net carrying amount 
in its two step test  the company uses the discounted cash flow method and the guideline company method for determining the fair value of its reporting units 
under these methods  the determination of implied fair value of the goodwill for a particular reporting unit is the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities in the same manner as the allocation in a business combination 
the techniques used in the company qualitative assessment and  if necessary  two step impairment test have incorporated a number of assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable and to reflect market conditions forecast at the assessment date 
assumptions in estimating future cash flows are subject to a high degree of judgment 
the company makes all efforts to forecast future cash flows as accurately as possible with the information available at the time a forecast is made 
to this end  the company evaluates the appropriateness of its assumptions as well as its overall forecasts by comparing projected results of upcoming years with actual results of preceding years and validating that differences therein are reasonable 
key assumptions  all of which are level inputs refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  relate to price trends  material costs  discount rate  customer demand  and the long term growth and foreign exchange rates 
a number of benchmarks from independent industry and other economic publications were also used 
changes in assumptions and estimates after the assessment date may lead to an outcome where impairment charges would be required in future periods 
specifically  actual results may vary from the company s forecasts and such variations may be material and unfavorable  thereby triggering the need for future impairment tests where the conclusions may differ in reflection of prevailing market conditions 
in  goodwill was reviewed for impairment based on a two step test refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  which resulted in no impairment in any of the company reporting units 
as a result of the step impairment test  the company concluded the brazil reporting unit had excess fair value of approximately  or percent when compared to its carrying amount 
the amount of goodwill in the company brazil reporting unit was  as of december  all other reporting units had excess fair value greater than percent when compared to their carrying amounts 
in  the company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
in the qualitative assessment  management concluded that the company reporting units were not at risk of failing step one and therefore the two step impairment test was not performed 
in  goodwill was reviewed for impairment based on a two step test 
in  management concluded that all of the company s goodwill within the emea reporting unit was not recoverable and recorded a  non cash impairment charge during the fourth quarter taxes on income deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method  whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  operating loss carry forwards and tax credits 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment 
the company operates in numerous taxing jurisdictions and is subject to examination by various federal  state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods 
additionally  the company has retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses 
the company s income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which the company does business 
due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction  the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions  as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters  the company s estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments 
the company regularly assesses its position with regard to tax exposures and records liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties  if any  when the tax benefit is not more likely than not realizable 
the company has recorded an accrual that reflects the recognition and measurement process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax

additional future income tax expense or benefit may be recognized once the positions are effectively settled 
at the end of each interim reporting period  the company estimates the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned  as well as tax planning alternatives 
current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions may result in an increasing effective tax rate over time 
if the actual results differ from estimates  the company may adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period if such determination is made 
contingencies liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
there is no liability recorded for matters in which the liability is not probable and reasonably estimable 
attorneys in the company legal department monitor and manage all claims filed against the company and review all pending investigations 
generally  the estimate of probable loss related to these matters is developed in consultation with internal and outside legal counsel representing the company 
these estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
the company attempts to resolve these matters through settlements  mediation and arbitration proceedings when possible 
if the actual settlement costs  final judgments  or fines  after appeals  differ from the estimates  the future results may be materially impacted 
adjustments to the initial estimates are recorded when a change in the estimate is identified 
pensions and other postretirement benefits annual net periodic expense and benefit liabilities under the company s defined benefit plans are determined on an actuarial basis 
assumptions used in the actuarial calculations have a significant impact on plan obligations and expense 
members of the management investment committee periodically review the actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to the assumptions  if warranted 
the discount rate is determined by analyzing the average return of high quality ie  aa rated fixed income investments and the year over year comparison of certain widely used benchmark indices as of the measurement date 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is determined using the plans current asset allocation and their expected rates of return based on a geometric averaging over years 
the rate of compensation increase assumptions reflects the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
pension benefits are funded through deposits with trustees 
other postretirement benefits are not funded and the company s policy is to pay these benefits as they become due 
the following table represents assumed health care cost trend rates at december healthcare cost trend rate assumed for next year rate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline the ultimate trend rate year that rate reaches ultimate trend rate the healthcare trend rates are reviewed based upon the results of actual claims experience 
the company used healthcare cost trends of percent and percent in and  respectively  decreasing to an ultimate trend of percent in for both medical and prescription drug benefits using the society of actuaries long term trend model with assumptions based on the medicare trustees projections 
assumed healthcare cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans
