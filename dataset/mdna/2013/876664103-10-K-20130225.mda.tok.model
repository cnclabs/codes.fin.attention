the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and performance 
actual results may differ materially from those expected because of various risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof 
except as required by law  we assume no obligation to update these forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available in the future 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto  as well as risk factors elsewhere in this report 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco that owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us  and our refer to tco  the operating partnership  and or the operating partnership subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  manage  lease  acquire  dispose of  develop  and expand regional and super regional shopping centers and interests therein 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiaries taubman asia 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the opening of city creek center in march  as well as the dispositions of the pier shops at caesars the pier shops and regency square and the acquisitions of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village in additional comparable center statistics that exclude city creek center  the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village  the pier shops and regency square are provided to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for the entire current and preceding period 
the pier shops and regency square are excluded from all operating statistics 
see results of operations development  results of operations acquisitions  and results of operations dispositions discontinued operations  for background and information on operations of these centers 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term of new leases at approximately eight years during and  excluding temporary leases 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
our increase in sales per square foot growth moderated through the year and has now reached a more normalized level 
for the fourth quarter of  tenant sales per square foot increased from the corresponding period in the prior year 
for all of  tenant sales per square foot were  a increase from see mall tenant sales and center revenues 

table of contents ending occupancy was for comparable centers at december   up from we anticipate year end occupancy will be up modestly from rent per square foot increased in we expect that average rents per square foot in will be up in comparison to by approximately to 
the rents we are able to achieve are affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels  and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations and we provide information about transactions that affected the periods presented or will affect operations in the future

louis market  is scheduled to open in august we also have development projects including the mall at university town center  the mall of san juan  the retail component of xi an saigao city plaza  zhengzhou vancouver times square  and hanam union square  all of which are expected to open over the next several years 
we also provide information on our capital spending in and  as well as planned capital spending for and spending scheduled for all projects through their anticipated openings see liquidity and capital resources capital spending 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
mall tenant sales and center revenues our mall tenant sales per square foot growth has moderated through the year and has now reached a more normalized level 
our mall tenants reported a increase in sales per square foot in the fourth quarter of compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
for all of  our tenant sales increased over to a new record level for our centers of per square foot 
over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses  excluding utilities together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs  and may be impacted significantly  either positively or negatively  by the success or lack of success of a small number of tenants or even a single tenant 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as tenant sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of tenant sales at higher sales per square foot 
tenant sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in tenant sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share of total rents that percentage rents represent 
over the last five years  percentage rent as a share of total rent has ranged from to 
while tenant sales are critical over the long term  the high quality regional mall business has been a very stable business model with its diversity of income from thousands of tenants  its staggered lease maturities  and high proportion of fixed rent 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 

table of contents the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales combined minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
generally  center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases 
average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the lease currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions 
in periods of increasing sales  as we are experiencing now  rents on new leases will generally tend to rise 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason  as tenants expectations of future growth become less optimistic 
average rent per square foot in is expected to be up about to

the spread between opening and closing rents may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from period to period depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant ending occupancy  average occupancy  and leased space rates are as follows ending occupancy all centers ending occupancy comparable centers average occupancy all centers average occupancy comparable centers leased space all centers leased space comparable centers we expect year end occupancy will be up modestly from temporary tenant leasing continues to be strong and ended the year at about for comparable centers compared to in and in temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than or equal to a year  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases was in  compared to in  and in 
table of contents seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school period 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter 
gains on sales of peripheral land and lease cancellation income may vary significantly from quarter to quarter

because the seasonality of sales contrasts with the generally fixed nature of minimum rents and recoveries  mall tenant occupancy costs the sum of minimum rents  percentage rents  and expense recoveries  excluding utilities as a percentage of sales are considerably higher in the first three quarters than they are in the fourth quarter

the million purchase price for the outside partner interest in the consolidated joint venture that owns the center consisted of million of cash and approximately million of beneficial interest in debt 
the excess of the purchase price over the net book value of the interest acquired has been accounted for as a reduction of our shareholder equity 
also in december  we acquired an additional interest in waterside shops  which brought our ownership interest in the center to 
the acquisition of the additional interest was accomplished by purchasing an affiliate of oregon pers interest in the center on a pari passu basis with an affiliate of the forbes company

center operations for the year ended december   noi excluding lease cancellation income was up from we estimate that noi of our comparable centers  excluding lease cancellation income  will be up at least in we are estimating that our recoveries ratio will be roughly even with we expect increased tenant rents resulting from higher average rent per square foot with a modest increase in occupancy 
see results of operations use of non gaap measures for the definition and discussion of noi and see reconciliation of net income to net operating income 
management  leasing and development services our management and leasing services to woodfield mall in schaumburg  illinois were terminated in november we expect net management  leasing  and development income to be in the range of million to million in  including the final leasing success fee relating to ifc mall in and the impact of the loss of the woodfield mall contract 

table of contents other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
shopping center related revenues include parking  sponsorship  and other income 
lease cancellation revenue is primarily dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
in  lease cancellation income was high primarily due to two large payments 
our share of lease cancellation income from continuing operations over the last five years ranged from s million to s million 
in  we are currently estimating our share of lease cancellation income to be in the range of million to million 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with potential purchasers of land  as well as the economy and the timing of the transactions 
in february  we closed on a land sale with an approximately million gain

during  we incurred million of general and administrative expenses in the us our quarterly general and administrative expense run rate is now expected to be about million  including us and asia costs 
we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  until it is considered probable the project will reach a successful conclusion 
in  our share of such expenses was million

at december   borrowings under trg s revolving credit facility are primary obligations of the entities owning dolphin mall  fairlane town center  and twelve oaks mall  which are collateral for the revolving line of credit 
in january  we refinanced our existing loan on great lakes crossing outlets with a new year  million loan with a stated fixed rate of see liquidity and capital resources 
in december  we assumed million of additional beneficial interest in debt as part of our purchase of an additional interest in international plaza 
we have and will continue to consolidate international plaza in our financial statements as a result of our controlling interest in the center 
therefore  the debt of international plaza was already presented at in our consolidated balance sheet for periods prior to the acquisition 
also in december  we assumed million of additional beneficial interest in debt as part of our purchase of an additional interest in the unconsolidated joint venture waterside shops see results of operations acquisitions 
in december  we assumed million of debt in relation to the acquisition of the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village see results of operations acquisitions

proceeds from the issuance were used to redeem all of our million series g preferred stock and million series h preferred stock in september we recognized a million charge representing the difference in the book values over the redemption amounts of the series g and series h preferred stock redeemed 
this issuance and redemption will reduce our future annual preferred dividends paid by million 
also in august  we sold  of our common shares 
the proceeds were used to acquire an equal number of operating partnership units 
the operating partnership paid all offering costs 
the operating partnership used the net proceeds of million to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
in october  we redeemed the operating partnership series f preferred equity for million  which represented a million discount from the book value 
the million excess of the book value over the redemption amount was reflected as a reduction in earnings allocated to the noncontrolling interests in 
table of contents in june  we sold  of our common shares 
the proceeds were used to acquire an equal number of operating partnership units 
the operating partnership paid all offering costs 
the operating partnership used the net proceeds  after offering costs  of million to reduce outstanding borrowings under our revolving lines of credit 
use of non gaap measures we use net operating income noi as an alternative measure to evaluate the operating performance of centers  both on individual and stabilized portfolio bases 
we define noi as property level operating revenues includes rental income excluding straight line adjustments of minimum rent less maintenance  taxes  utilities  promotion  ground rent including straight line adjustments  and other property operating expenses 
since noi excludes general and administrative expenses  pre development charges  interest income and expense  depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  restructuring charges  and gains from land and property dispositions  it provides a performance measure that  when compared period over period  reflects the revenues and expenses most directly associated with owning and operating rental properties  as well as the impact on their operations from trends in tenant sales  occupancy and rental rates  and operating costs 
we also use noi excluding lease cancellation income as an alternative measure because this income may vary significantly from period to period  which can affect comparability and trend analysis 
we generally provide separate projections for expected noi growth and our lease cancellation income 
the operating results in the following table include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents our share of the earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization of our consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties and impairment write downs of depreciable real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
we may also present adjusted versions of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  and ffo when used by management to evaluate our operating performance when certain significant items have impacted our results that affect comparability with prior or future periods due to the nature or amounts of these items 
in addition to the reasons noted above for each measure  we believe the disclosure of the adjusted items is similarly useful to investors and others to understand management view on comparability of such measures between periods 
in  ffo was adjusted for the charge upon redemption of our series g and h preferred stock  the prc tax on sale of assets of taubman tcbl  and the loss on extinguishment of debt related to the refinancing of millenia 
in  ffo was adjusted for the gains on extinguishment of debt related to the disposition of the pier shops and regency square  acquisition costs related to the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village  and taubman tcbl  and our redemption of the operating partnership series f preferred equity 
ffo was not adjusted in our presentations of noi  beneficial interest in ebitda  ffo  and adjusted versions of these measures  if any  are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  these measures do not represent cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
reconciliations of net income attributable to taubman centers  inc common shareowners to funds from operations and adjusted funds from operations  net income to beneficial interest in ebitda  and net income to net operating income are presented following application of critical accounting policies

table of contents application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers the viability of all projects under construction or development  including those owned by unconsolidated joint ventures  are regularly evaluated under applicable accounting requirements  including requirements relating to abandonment of assets or changes in use 
to the extent a project  or individual components of the project  are no longer considered to have value  the related capitalized costs are charged against operations 
additionally  all properties are reviewed for impairment on an individual basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities is recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  expected holding period  and availability of credit 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged to income 
no impairment charges were recognized in  or as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see results of operations use of non gaap measures 
on an ongoing basis  we continue to assess the probability of a project going forward and whether the asset is impaired 
in addition  we also assess whether there are sufficient substantive development activities in a given period to support the capitalization of carrying costs  including interest capitalization 
direct and indirect costs that are clearly related to the acquisition  development  construction  and improvement of properties are capitalized 
compensation costs are allocated based on actual time spent on a project 
costs incurred on real estate for ground leases  property taxes  insurance  and interest costs for qualifying assets are capitalized during periods in which activities necessary to get the property ready for its intended use are in progress 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  global  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 

table of contents as of december   our beneficial interest in construction work in process was million  representing our share of capitalized project costs for our current us and asia development projects see liquidity and capital resources capital spending 
we also had a million balance of capitalized development pre construction costs as of december   which consists primarily of approximately million of land and site improvements relating to our oyster bay project 
the balance also includes land for future development in atlanta  georgia 
pre development charges in   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  million  million  and million related to projects with land under option in each of the respective periods 
we capitalized payroll costs of million in connection with construction and development projects in capitalized payroll costs were immaterial for and valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent approximately of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable represents of total revenues in and has ranged from to over the last five years 
notes receivable at december  totaled million  of which million is a short term note related to the disposition of assets of taubman tcbl see note accounts and notes receivable 
valuation of the recoverability of notes receivable is dependent on management s estimates of the collectibility of contractual principal and interest payments  which are inherently judgmental 
valuation of deferred tax assets we currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation  net operating loss carryforwards and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings 
expected future taxable earnings require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our taxable reit subsidiaries 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
as of december   we had a net federal  state  and foreign deferred tax asset of million  after a valuation allowance of million 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned unless it was already consolidated  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important for the recording of the acquisition at fair value  and allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles 
in december  we acquired an additional interest in waterside shops 
our share of the difference between the purchase price and the net book value of the additional interest in the unconsolidated joint venture that owns waterside shops has been preliminarily allocated to the venture land  buildings  improvements  and equipment  as well as its mortgage debt 
in  we acquired the mall at green hills  the gardens on el paseo and el paseo village
