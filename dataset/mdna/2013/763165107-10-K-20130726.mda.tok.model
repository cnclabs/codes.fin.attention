other income expense other income expense was income of million during fiscal  compared to income of million during fiscal other income expense included a foreign exchange loss of million  as compared to a foreign exchange gain of less than million during fiscal our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of us dollars held in us entities

table of contents income tax provision benefit our income tax provision during fiscal year was million 
our income tax benefit for fiscal year was million 
during fiscal  we had an income tax provision of million 
the effective income tax rates for continuing operations during fiscal   and  were   and  respectively 
the difference between the effective tax rates as compared to the us federal statutory rate of during and and during fiscal  resulted from our geographical distribution of taxable income or losses  return to provisions adjustments  the release of income tax reserves for uncertain tax positions  changes in the amount of foreign earnings considered to be permanently reinvested  and changes in valuation allowance 
there were no changes in judgment during the fiscal year end regarding the beginning of year valuation allowance which would require a benefit to be excluded from the annual effective tax rate and allocated to the interim period 
as of june   we had no domestic federal net operating loss nol carryforwards 
domestic state nol carryforwards amounted to approximately million 
foreign nol carryforwards totaled approximately million with various or indefinite expiration dates 
we also had no alternative minimum tax credit carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforwards as of june  the domestic federal nol and foreign tax credit generated in fiscal are expected to be carried back to prior tax years 
management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets 
a significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income of loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three year period ended june  on the basis of this evaluation  as of june   a valuation allowance of million has been recorded to record only the portion of the deferred tax asset that more likely than not will be realized 
the valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets in jurisdictions where cumulative losses have been incurred  and domestic state nol carryforwards related to states where the utilization of nols have been suspended 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased  or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth 
our future us federal statutory tax rate is expected to be closer to  our state effective tax rate is expected to be approximately  and our foreign effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 
income taxes paid  including foreign estimated tax payments  were million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
we have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to the extent of cash available will be repatriated to the us  and accordingly  we have provided a deferred tax liability totaling million and million as of june  and june   respectively  on foreign earnings of million 
in addition  as of june   million of cumulative positive earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries are still considered permanently reinvested pursuant to asc  income taxes other considerations or special areas asc 
due to various tax attributes that are constantly changing  it is not practical to determine what  if any  tax liability might exist if such earnings were to be repatriated 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world 
generally  years prior to fiscal are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for us federal  state or local  or us tax jurisdictions 
during fiscal  we completed federal audits in the us for fiscal   and our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are germany and the netherlands 
we have tax years open in germany and the netherlands beginning in fiscal 
table of contents discontinued operations arrow transaction on march   we completed the sale of the assets primarily used or held for use in  and certain liabilities of  our rfpd division  as well as certain other company assets  including our information technology assets  to arrow in exchange for million  which included an estimated pre closing working capital adjustment of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a working capital adjustment of million in our results from discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we paid arrow million to settle the working capital adjustment 
following the transaction  the compensation committee of our board of directors granted cash bonus compensation to certain executive officers and former employees in recognition of their efforts for successfully completing the transaction 
the cash bonus compensation amount awarded was approximately million  and was recorded as expense from discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal to help facilitate the transition of rfpd to arrow  we agreed to provide certain transitional services to arrow such as financial support services  warehouse services  and access to facilities in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
arrow also agreed to provide certain transitional services such as information technology services  warehouse services  and access to facilities and equipment in accordance with the terms of the transition services agreement 
the duration of the transitional services were less than one year from march   except for the information technology services which is three years 
in addition  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with arrow  in connection with the transaction  for a term of three years 
pursuant to the manufacturing agreement  we agreed to manufacture certain products for arrow 
the transition services agreement  which commenced on march   and ended on march   allowed us to exert very limited influence over arrow s operating and financial policies 
the continuing cash flows related to our transition services agreement as well as the manufacturing agreement  are insignificant 
we believe it is appropriate to include fees and associated costs with the transition services agreement that relate to financial support  certain facilities  and certain warehouse services in discontinued operations as they relate specifically to rfpd 
we further believe it is appropriate to treat the revenue and costs associated with the manufacturing agreement as discontinued operations as it relates specifically to rfpd

we believe we will continue to have sufficient liquidity to fund our future growth strategies for our remaining business in the foreseeable future 
cash flows from operating activities the cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net income  adjusted for non cash items  and changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
operating activities  which include our discontinued operations  provided million of cash during fiscal we had net income of million during fiscal  which included non cash stock based compensation expense of million associated with the issuance of stock option awards primarily to our directors and officers and depreciation and amortization expense of million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets 
changes in our operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquired businesses  provided million of cash during fiscal  due primarily to the decrease in inventory of million  decrease in our accounts receivable of million  partially offset by an increase to our prepaid expenses of million 
the decrease in our inventory was the result of reduced inventory purchases during fiscal due to the decline in net sales 
the decrease in our receivables of million was due primarily to the improvement in our day sales outstanding and lower sales volume 
the increase in prepaid expenses of million was due primarily to the renewal of our liability insurance coverage 
cash used in operating activities  including our discontinued operations  during fiscal was million 
the million of cash used in operating activities primarily reflects a decrease of million in accrued liabilities  a million decrease in long term tax liabilities  a million increase in income tax receivable  and an increase of million in inventory  offset by a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the million decrease in accrued liabilities  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  was due primarily to our tax payment related to the sale of rfpd during fiscal the million decrease in long term tax liabilities  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  relates primarily to adjustments to our deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes to the amounts of permanently reinvested foreign earnings 
the million in income tax receivable relates to an overpayment in our estimated tax during fiscal the million in inventory  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of million  was due primarily to increased purchasing to support future sales growth 
the million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets  excluding the impact of foreign exchange of less than million  was due primarily to the final payment received of million  from arrow for the sale of rfpd 
cash flows from investing activities the cash flow from investing activities has consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures

our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and cds 
purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
cash flows from financing activities the cash flow from financing activities primarily consists of repurchases of common stock and cash dividends paid 
cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal  resulted from million of cash used to repurchase common stock and million in dividends paid  offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the repurchase of common stock relates to our share repurchase authorizations

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  inventory obsolescence  goodwill and other intangible assets  loss contingencies  and income taxes 
management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial position and the results of operations 
their application involves significant judgments and estimates in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables 
the estimates are influenced by the following continuing credit evaluation of customers financial conditions  aging of receivables  individually and in the aggregate  a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas  collectability and delinquency history by geographic area  and the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of net sales 
significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately million as of june   and june  revenue recognition our product sales are recognized as revenue upon shipment  when title passes to the customer  when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we also record estimated discounts and returns based on our historical experience 
our products are often manufactured to meet the specific design needs of our customers applications 
our engineers work closely with customers to ensure that our products will meet their needs 
our customers are under no obligation to compensate us for designing the products we sell 
in the limited cases where remaining performance obligations exist after delivery of the product  the obligation relative to the unit of accounting is inconsequential or perfunctory and is not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
this conclusion was reached based on the following facts the timing of any remaining obligation is agreed upon with the customer  which in most cases  is performed immediately after the delivery of the product  the cost and time involved to complete the remaining obligation is insignificant in relation to the item sold  and the costs and time do not vary significantly  we have a demonstrated history of completing the remaining obligations timely  and finally  failure to complete the remaining obligation does not enable the customer to receive a full or partial refund of the product or service  and the timing of the payment for the product is not contingent upon completion of remaining performance obligations  if any 
inventories our worldwide inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  generally using a weighted average cost method 
our inventories included approximately million of finished goods and million of raw materials and work in progress as of june   as compared to approximately million of finished goods and million of raw materials and work in progress as of june  
table of contents provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges  obsolescence  the exiting of certain market segments  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand  changes in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
we recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded based on the premium paid for acquisitions and is subsequently tested for impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicates an impairment may have occurred  such as a significant adverse change in the business climate  loss of key personnel or a decision to sell or dispose of a reporting unit 
as of the fiscal year ended june   our goodwill balance was million and represents the premium we paid for powerlink of million during our second quarter of fiscal  adjusted for foreign currency translation  and the premium we paid for d and c of million during our second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  our goodwill balances are reviewed for impairment through the application of a fair value based test  using the third quarter as the measurement date 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results  discounted cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other  if indicators of impairment are deemed to be present  we would perform an interim impairment test and any resulting impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified 
the results of our goodwill impairment tests as of march   indicated no goodwill impairment as estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded the carrying value 
intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined on quoted market prices in active markets  if available  or recognized valuation models 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name  customer relationships  and non compete agreements acquired in connection with the acquisition of powerlink during our second quarter of fiscal and d and c acquired during our second quarter of fiscal loss contingencies we accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when only a range of possible loss can be established  the most probable amount in the range is accrued 
if no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred  we will include a disclosure describing the contingency 

table of contents income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence 
these factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where we  or any of our affiliates  have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards

is deferring 
in order to defer only those changes in asu no 
that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments  the paragraphs in asu no 
supersede certain pending paragraphs in asu no 
the amendments are being made to allow the fasb time to re deliberate whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of the reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented 
while the fasb is considering the operational concerns about the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments and the needs of financial statement users for additional information about reclassification adjustments  entities should continue to report reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income consistent with the presentation requirements in effect before asu no 
all other requirements in asu no 
are not affected by asu no 
 including the requirement to report comprehensive income either in a single continuous financial statement or in two separate but consecutive financial statements 
public entities should apply these requirements for fiscal years  and interim periods with those years  beginning after december   and as such  we have adopted asu no 
during our third quarter of fiscal during november  the fasb issued asu no 
 balance sheet topic disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  asu update no 

asu update no 
 requires an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
offsetting  otherwise known as netting  is the presentation of assets and liabilities as a single net amount in the statement of financial position balance sheet 
an entity is required to apply the amendments for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
we will be adopting asu update no 
during our first quarter of fiscal  and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial results 
during may  the fasb issued asc update no 
 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income  asc update no 

this amends the fasb accounting standards codification to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the 
table of contents components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with the total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu update no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
asu update no 
should be applied retrospectively 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim period within those years  beginning after december   and as such  we adopted asc update no 
during our third quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments we are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve 
the primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange  as certain operations  assets  and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies 
we manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities 
the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect our operations 
additional disclosure regarding various market risks are set forth in part i  item a  risk factors of our annual report on this form k 
foreign currency exposure even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken  our financial statements denominated in a non us functional currency are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables  as we conduct business in countries of the european union  asia pacific and  to a lesser extent  canada and latin america 
we could manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in sales contracts  local debt to offset asset exposures  and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions 
we have not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal  fiscal  or fiscal had the us dollar changed unfavorably against various foreign currencies  foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated million during fiscal  an estimated million during fiscal  and an estimated million during fiscal total assets would have declined by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june   and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june   while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june   and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june  the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchanges rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect our operations
