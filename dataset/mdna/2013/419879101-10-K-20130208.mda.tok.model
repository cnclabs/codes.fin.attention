item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further information regarding our liquidity 

table of contents our financial liquidity could be adversely affected by credit market conditions 
our business requires access to capital markets to finance equipment purchases  including aircraft  and to provide liquidity in seasonal or cyclical periods of weaker revenue generation 
in particular  we intend to obtain additional debt or lease financing for our upcoming aircraft deliveries 
additionally  we will face specific funding requirements upon the expiration of indebtedness related to the purchase of three previously leased boeing aircraft at the end of and with respect to our obligation under a purchase agreement with airbus to acquire wide body a aircraft and axwb extra wide body aircraft with expected delivery dates through global credit market conditions remain unsettled  affecting the availability of financing and increasing the cost of financing that can be acquired 
we can offer no assurance that the financing we need will be available when required or that the economic terms on which it is available will not adversely affect our financial condition 
if we cannot obtain financing or we cannot obtain financing on commercially reasonably terms  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our substantial debt could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition  and include covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations 
at december   our total debt was million  of which million is fixed rate debt 
our fixed rate debt primarily consists of facility agreements for our aircraft purchases 
our substantial debt obligations may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt in the future on acceptable terms or at all  which will impact our ability to fund our working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general purpose needs 
our substantial debt and related covenants could expose us to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other operational purposes  increase the volatility of the price of our common stock  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  limit  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt  our ability to borrow additional funds  and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors and competitors with debt agreements on more favorable terms than us 
the terms of certain of our financing agreements restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  prepay indebtedness  make investments  make acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  repurchase stock and  in the case of hawaiian  pay dividends or make distributions to our parent company 
these agreements also require us to meet certain financial covenants 
if we breach any of these covenants it could result in a default under these facilities  which could cause our outstanding obligations under these facilities to accelerate and become due and payable immediately  and could also cause us to default under our other debt or lease obligations and lead to an acceleration of the obligations related to such other debt or lease obligations 
the existence of such a default could also preclude us from borrowing funds under our credit facilities 
our ability to comply with the provisions of financing agreements can be affected by events beyond our control and a default under any such financing agreements if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse impact on us 
in the event our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay these obligations or to refinance our debt obligations  resulting in a material adverse impact on us 

table of contents we could be required to maintain reserves under our credit card processing agreements which could adversely impact our financial and business operations 
under our bank issued credit card processing agreements  certain proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur 
these holdbacks  which are included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million at december  in the event of a material adverse change in our business  the holdback could incrementally increase to an amount up to of the applicable credit card air traffic liability  which would also cause an increase in the level of restricted cash 
if we are unable to obtain a waiver  or otherwise mitigate the increase in restricted cash  it could adversely affect our liquidity and also cause a covenant violation under other debt or lease obligations and have a material adverse impact on us 
our obligations for funding our defined benefit pension plans are significant and are affected by factors beyond our control 
we sponsor three defined benefit pension plans  as well as a separate plan to administer pilots disability benefits 
two of the pension plans were frozen effective october   and our collective bargaining agreement with our pilots provides that pension benefit accruals for certain pilots were frozen effective january  nevertheless  our unfunded pension and disability obligation was million as of december  we made contributions of million and million for and  respectively  and anticipate funding million minimum required contribution to the defined benefit pension and disability plans during the timing and amount of funding requirements depend upon a number of factors  including labor negotiations and changes to pension plan benefits as well as factors outside our control  such as the number and demographic data of qualified retiring employees  asset returns  interest rates and changes in pension laws 
these factors  along with the impact of results that can vary significantly from estimates  may significantly impact our funding requirements and have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
competitive environment risks we operate in an extremely competitive environment 
the airline industry is characterized by low profit margins  high fixed costs and significant price competition 
we currently compete with other airlines on our neighbor island  north america and international routes 
the commencement of  or increase in  service on our routes by existing or new carriers could negatively impact our operating results 
many of our competitors on our north america and international routes are larger and have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do 
aggressive marketing tactics or a prolonged fare war initiated by one or more of these competitors could adversely affect our financial resources and our ability to compete in these markets 
since airline markets have few natural barriers to entry  we also face the threat of new entrants in all of our markets  including competition from low cost carriers lcc 
allegiant  a lcc  launched flights from the west coast to hawaii in and southwest airlines has taken further steps to enable the carrier to provide service to hawaii in the future  but has yet to formally announce the service 
furthermore  large network carriers have significantly reduced their costs and adjusted their routes to compete with lccs in their existing markets by diverting resources to long haul markets such as hawaii  where lcc competition has been less severe 
as a result  network carriers have reduced their costs of operation and increased capacity in the hawaii market 
additional capacity to hawaii  whether from network carriers or lccs  could result in a decrease in our share of the markets in which we operate  a decline in our yields  or both  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents airline bankruptcy restructuring  strategic combinations or industry consolidation could have an impact on our competitive environment 
in recent years  many of our competitors have dramatically reduced operating costs through a combination of bankruptcy restructuring  industry consolidation and vendor and labor negotiations to increase market strength 
several domestic airlines were able to reduce labor costs  restructure debt and lease agreements  and implement other financial improvements through the bankruptcy process 
in addition  certain of our competitors have merged to create larger and more financially sound airlines 
through consolidation  carriers have the opportunity to achieve cost reductions by eliminating redundancy in their networks and operating structures 
with reduced costs  these competitors are more capable of operating profitably in an environment of reduced fares and may  as a result  increase service in our primary markets or reduce fares to attract additional customers 
because airline customers are price sensitive  we cannot assure that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of customers at sufficiently high fare levels to generate profitability  or that we will be able to reduce our operating costs sufficiently to remain competitive with these other airlines 
the concentration of our business in hawaii  and between hawaii and the us mainland  provides little diversification of our revenue 
approximately of our revenue is generated from air transportation between the islands of hawaii and the us mainland  and within the hawaiian islands 
many of our competitors  particularly major network carriers with whom we compete on our north america routes  enjoy greater geographical diversification of their revenue 
a reduction in the level of demand for travel within hawaii  or to hawaii from the us mainland  or an increase in the level of industry capacity on these routes may reduce the revenue we are able to generate and adversely affect our financial results 
as these routes account for a significantly higher proportion of our revenue than they do for many of our competitors  such a reduction would have a relatively greater adverse impact on our financial results 
our business is affected by the competitive advantages held by network carriers in the north america market 
the majority of competition on our north america routes are from network carriers such as alaska  american  delta  united and us airways 
network carriers have a number of competitive advantages that may enable them to offer lower fares and attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us network carriers generate passenger traffic from and throughout the us mainland 
in contrast  we lack a comparable direct network to feed passengers to our north america flights and are  therefore  more reliant on passenger demand in the specific cities we serve 
we also rely on our code share partner agreements jetblue  virgin america airlines  etc 
to provide customers access to from north america destinations currently unserved by us 
most network carriers operate from hubs  which can provide a built in market of passengers  depending on the economic strength of the hub city and the size of the customer group that frequent the airline 
our honolulu and maui hubs do not originate a large proportion of north american travel  nor does it have the population or potential customer franchise of a larger city to provide us with a built in market 
passengers in the north america market  for the most part  do not originate in honolulu  but rather on the us mainland  making honolulu primarily a destination rather than an origin of passenger traffic 
our neighbor island market is affected by narrow body competition from regional carriers 
approximately of our revenue is generated from our neighbor island routes 
our competitors on these routes include regional carriers which provide service amongst the hawaiian islands including service between oahu  maui  hawaii  molokai  kauai and lanai 
although we enjoy a competitive position on the neighbor island service  increased competition is possible 
for example  island air 
table of contents recently announced its intent to increase capacity on travel throughout the neighbor island routes with lease commitments for six additional aircraft 
we have also recently purchased two turboprop aircraft to expand our neighbor island network to areas we currently do not serve and to meet the travel demands of our passengers 
however  a decline in our share of the neighbor island market due to increased capacity provided by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our international routes are affected by competition from domestic and foreign carriers 
approximately of our revenue is generated from our international routes 
our competitors on these routes include both domestic and foreign carriers 
both domestic and foreign competitors have a number of competitive advantages that may enable them to offer lower fares and attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us many of our domestic competitors have joined airline alliances  including skyteam  star alliance and oneworld  none of which we participate in  which provide customers access to each participating airline international network  allowing for convenience and connectivity to their destinations 
these alliances formed by our domestic competitors have increased in recent years 
in some instances our domestic competitors have been granted antitrust exemptions to form joint venture arrangements in certain geographies further deepening their cooperation on certain routes 
we currently do not participate in a world wide airline alliance or any joint ventures  which may negatively impact our market share and operations as capacity provided by our competitors increase 
to mitigate this risk  we rely on code share agreements with partner airlines to provide customers access to international destinations currently unserved by us 
many of our foreign competitors such as japan airlines  all nippon airways  qantas  korean air  philippine airlines  are network carriers that generate passenger traffic throughout international routes that we service 
in contrast  we lack a comparable direct network to feed passengers to our international flights  and are therefore  more reliant on passenger demand in the specific destinations that we serve 
most network carriers operate from hubs  which can provide a built in home base market of passengers 
passengers on our international routes  for the most part  do not originate in hawaii  but rather internationally  in these foreign markets home base 
we also rely on our code sharing agreements all nippon airways  korean air  virgin australia  etc 
and our relationships with travel agencies and wholesale distributors to provide customers access to from international destinations currently unserved by us 
strategy and brand risks our failure to successfully implement our growth strategy and related cost reduction goals could harm our business 
our growth strategy includes initiatives to increase revenue  decrease costs  expand our existing markets  and initiate service on new routes and markets that we currently do not serve in the us and internationally 
it is critical that we achieve our growth strategy in order for our business to attain economies of scale and to sustain or improve our results of operations 
if we are unable to utilize and fill increased capacity provided by additional aircraft entering our fleet  hire and retain skilled personnel  secure the required equipment and facilities in a cost effective manner  or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals  we may not be able to successfully implement our growth strategy into new and existing markets in the us and internationally  and our business and operations could be adversely affected 

table of contents we continue to strive toward aggressive cost containment goals which are an important part of our business strategy to offer the best value to passengers through competitive fares while maintaining acceptable profit margins and return on capital 
we believe a lower cost structure will better position us to fund our growth strategy and take advantage of market opportunities 
if we are unable to adequately contain our non fuel unit costs  we likely will not be able to achieve our growth plan and our financial results may suffer 
our reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of adverse publicity  including the event of an aircraft accident 
our customer base is broad and our business activities have significant prominence  particularly in the state of hawaii and the other cities we serve 
consequently  negative publicity resulting from real or perceived shortcomings in our customer service  employee relations  business conduct  or other events affecting our operations could negatively affect the public image of our company and the willingness of customers to purchase services from us  which could affect our revenue and financial results 
additionally  we are exposed to potential losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident 
any such accident could involve not only the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft and its consequential temporary or permanent loss of revenue  but also significant potential claims of injured passengers and others 
we are required by the dot to carry liability insurance  and although we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts consistent with the industry  we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will adequately cover us from all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses incurred with the accident 
in addition  any aircraft accident or incident could cause a public perception that we are less safe or reliable than other airlines  which would harm our business 
our failure to successfully implement our turboprop operations may impact our financial and business operations 
in  we purchased and took delivery of two atr turboprop aircraft with service to new neighbor island routes previously unserved by us to begin in we cannot be assured that we will successfully implement our turboprop operations in a timely and cost efficient manner and comply with all applicable state and operational regulations 
new entrants or changes to existing competition on these neighbor island routes currently unserved by us could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
fleet and fleet related risks we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers for aircraft  aircraft engines and parts 
we are dependent on boeing and airbus as our primary supplier of aircraft and aircraft related items 
as a result  we are vulnerable to any problems associated with the supply of those aircraft and parts which could result in increased parts and maintenance costs in future years 
our agreement to purchase airbus a and axwb aircraft and our memorandum of understanding to purchase airbus aneo aircraft significantly increases our future financial commitments and operating costs and creates implementation risk associated with the transition from our existing boeing fleet 
as of december   our firm aircraft orders consisted of thirteen a aircraft for delivery between and and six axwb aircraft for delivery beginning in  along with purchase rights for an additional three a aircraft and six axwb aircraft 
we have made substantial pre delivery payments for the purchased aircraft and are required to continue these pre delivery payments as well as payments for the balance of the purchase price through delivery of each aircraft 
these commitments substantially increase our future capital spending requirements and 
table of contents will require us to significantly increase our level of debt in future years 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise capital to finance these requirements or that such financing can be obtained on favorable terms  or at all 
in january  we entered into a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of airbus aneo aircraft scheduled for delivery between and  along with purchase rights for an additional nine aircraft 
when we execute a firm commitment through the execution of a purchase agreement  which we expect will occur in the first quarter of  we expect our future capital spending requirement and level of debt to increase significantly in future years 
we also anticipate substantial pre delivery payments through the delivery date of each aircraft 
the airbus aircraft will replace expiring leased and retiring boeing aircraft in future years 
although we do not expect to incur significant lease return costs  we cannot be assured that such costs will not exceed our expectations and adversely impact our results of operations and liquidity 
the addition of the airbus aircraft to our fleet will require us to incur additional costs related to the acquisition of spare engines and replacement parts  maintenance of the aircraft  training of crews and ground employees  the addition of these aircraft types to our operating certificate and other implementation activities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover these costs through the future operation of these aircraft in our fleet or that we will not experience delays in the implementation process which could adversely affect our operations or financial performance 
delays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of fleet capacity may adversely impact our operations and financial results 
the success of our business depends on  among other things  the ability to effectively operate a certain number and type of aircraft 
as mentioned above  we have contractual commitments to purchase and integrate airbus aircraft into our fleet 
if for any reason we are unable to secure deliveries of the airbus aircraft on contractually scheduled delivery dates and successfully introduce these aircraft into our fleet  then our business  operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted 
our failure to integrate newly purchased airbus aircraft into our fleet as planned may require us to seek extensions on our existing leased aircraft 
such extensions may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them  resulting in increased maintenance costs 
common stock risks our share price is subject to fluctuations and stockholders could have difficulty trading shares 
the market price of our stock is influenced by many factors  a number of which are outside of our control  and include the following operating results and financial condition  changes in the competitive environment in which we operate  fuel price volatility including the availability of fuel  announcements concerning our competitors including bankruptcy filings  mergers  restructurings or acquisitions by other airlines  increases or changes in government regulation  general and industry specific market conditions  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  and sales of our common stock or other actions by investors with significant shareholdings 

table of contents in recent years the stock market has experienced volatile price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies 
these market fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions may affect the price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in the company stock price 
this type of litigation  if filed against us  could result in substantial costs and divert our management attention and resources 
in addition  the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by us or by our existing stockholders may have an adverse impact on the market price of the shares of common stock 
there can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near its current level 
the issuance of common stock upon conversion of convertible notes could cause dilution to the interests of our existing stockholders 
as of december   we had million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding 
upon conversion  we will have the right  at our election  to pay or deliver cash  shares of the company common stock or a combination thereof 
holders may convert their convertible notes at their option at any time prior to november   if specific conditions are met 
holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of the convertible notes upon a fundamental change  primarily a change in control or a termination of trading  at a cash repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the number of shares issued could be significant and such an issuance could cause significant dilution to the interests of the existing stockholders 
in addition  if we elect to pay the repurchase price in cash  our liquidity could be adversely affected 
information technology and third party risks we are increasingly dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business 
we depend heavily on technology and automated systems to effectively operate our business 
these systems include flight operations systems  communications systems  airport systems  reservations systems  management and accounting systems  commercial websites  including www 
hawaiianairlines 
com  and other systems  all of which must be able to accommodate high traffic volumes  maintain secure information and provide accurate flight information  as well as process critical financial related transactions 
any substantial or repeated failures of these systems could negatively affect our customer service  compromise the security of customer information  result in the loss of important data  loss of revenue and increased costs  and generally harm our business 
like other companies  our systems may be vulnerable to disruptions due to events beyond our control  including natural disasters  power disruptions  software or equipment failures  terrorist attacks  cybersecurity threats  computer viruses and hackers 
there can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to reduce the adverse effects of certain potential failures or disruptions are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions of our systems 
in addition  we will need to continuously make significant investments in technology to periodically upgrade and replace existing systems 
if we are unable to make these investments or fail to successfully implement  upgrade or replace our systems  our business could be adversely impacted 
if we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer related information  we could damage our reputation  incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 
we receive  retain  and transmit certain personal information about our customers 
in addition  our online operation at www 
hawaiianairlines 
com relies on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including credit card information 
a compromise of our physical and network security systems through a cybersecurity attack  including those of our business partners  may threaten our customers personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons  which could 
table of contents adversely affect our reputation  as well as negatively impact our business  results of operations  financial position and liquidity  and could result in the imposition of penalties or litigation against us 
in addition  a cybersecurity breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems which could result in a disruption of our operations 
we are highly reliant on third party contractors to provide certain facilities and services for our operations  and termination of our third party agreements could have a potentially adverse effect on our financial results 
we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business  including aircraft maintenance and parts  code sharing  reservations  computer services including hosting and software maintenance  accounting  frequent flyer programs  passenger processing  ground facilities  baggage and cargo handling  personnel training and the distribution and sale of airline seats 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  our reliance on outside vendors has increased and may continue to do so in the future 
the failure of any of our third party service providers to adequately perform our service obligations  or other interruptions of services  may reduce our revenues  increase expenses  and prevent us from operating our flights and providing other services to our customers 
in addition  our business and financial performance could be materially harmed if our customers believe that our services are unreliable or unsatisfactory 
labor relations and related costs risks we are dependent on satisfactory labor relations 
labor costs are a significant component of airline expenses and can substantially impact an airline results of operations 
labor and related benefit costs represented approximately of our operating expenses for the year ended december  at december   approximately of our workforce was unionized 
we may make strategic and operational decisions that require the consent of one or more of our labor unions  and cannot assure you that these labor unions will not require additional wages  benefits or other consideration in return for their consent 
in addition  we have entered into collective bargaining agreements with our pilots  mechanical group employees  clerical group employees  flight attendants  and dispatchers 
currently  we are not in negotiations with respect to any of our existing collective bargaining agreements 
we cannot assure you that future agreements with our employees unions will be on terms in line with our expectations or comparable to agreements entered into by our competitors  and any future agreements may increase our labor costs or otherwise adversely affect us 
if we are unable to reach an agreement with any unionized work group  we may be subject to future work interruptions and or stoppages  which may hamper or halt operations 
our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key executives  including our chief executive officer 
we are dependent on the knowledge and expertise of our key executives  particularly mark b 
dunkerley  our chief executive officer  who signed an amended and restated employment agreement in november  for employment through january  our ability to attract and retain such personnel in the airline industry is highly competitive  and we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our chief executive officer or other key executives or that we can attract other qualified personnel in the future 
any inability to retain our chief executive officer and other key executives  or attract and retain additional qualified executives  could have a negative impact on our operations 
in addition  as we continue to expand our operations through the acquisition of new aircraft and introduction of service to new markets  it may be challenging to attract qualified personnel including pilots  mechanics  flight attendants and other skilled labor 
as we compete with other carriers for qualified personnel we also face the challenge of attracting individuals who embrace our team oriented  
table of contents friendly and customer driven corporate culture 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel  who embrace our corporate culture  could have a negative impact on our reputation and overall operations 
airline industry  regulation and related costs risks the airline industry has substantial operating leverage and is affected by many conditions that are beyond its control  including delays  cancellations and other conditions  which could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
the airline industry operates on low gross profit margins consisting of a high percentage of fixed costs 
due to these fixed costs  the expense incurred on each flight does not vary proportionately with the number of passengers carried  however the revenue generated from a particular flight is directly related to the number of passengers carried and the respective average fares applied 
accordingly  a decrease in the number of passengers carried would cause a corresponding decrease in revenue if not offset by higher fares  and it may result in a disproportionately greater decrease in profits 
therefore  any general reduction in airline passenger traffic as a result of any of the following or other factors  which are largely outside of our control  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued threat of terrorist attacks and conflicts overseas  actual or threatened war and political instability  adverse weather and natural disasters  changes in consumer preferences  perceptions or spending patterns  increased costs related to security and safety measures  outbreak of contagious diseases  and actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control system 
our results from operations may be volatile subject to the conditions identified above 
we cannot assure you that our financial resources will be sufficient to absorb the effects of any of these unexpected factors should they arise 
our business is subject to substantial seasonal and cyclical volatility 
our results of operations will reflect the impact of seasonal volatility primarily due to passenger leisure and holiday travel patterns 
as hawaii is a popular vacation destination  demand from north america  our largest source of visitors  is typically stronger during june  july  august and december and considerably weaker at other times of the year 
as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations 
because of fluctuations in our results from seasonality  operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year 
terrorist attacks or international hostilities  or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities  even if not made directly on the airline industry could negatively affect us and the airline industry 
terrorist attacks  even if not made directly on the airline industry or the fear of such attacks  hostilities or act of war  could adversely affect the airline industry  including us  and could result in a significant decrease in demand for air travel  increased security costs  increased insurance costs covering war related risks  and increased flight operational loss due to cancellations and delays 
any future terrorist attacks or the implementation of additional security related fees could have a material adverse 
table of contents impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations and on the airline industry in general 
the airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation  new regulations  and taxes which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
airlines are subject to extensive regulatory requirements that result in significant costs 
additional laws  regulations  taxes and airport rates and charges imposed by domestic and foreign governments have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenue 
for example  the atsa  which became law in november  mandates the federalization of certain airport security procedures and imposes additional security requirements on airlines 
the faa from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures 
some faa requirements cover  among other things  retirement of older aircraft  security measures  collision avoidance systems  airborne windshear avoidance systems  noise abatement and other environmental concerns  commuter aircraft safety and increased inspections and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft 
under department of transportation regulations effective january  all taxes and fees imposed by the government must be disclosed in fares charged to customers 
also  in january  the department of transportation announced new flight crew rest rules which require mandatory rest periods for airline flight crews  including flight attendants and pilots for both traditional scheduled service and charter operations  to prevent fatigue on flights 
this rule is effective as of january  however we have started to implement crew rest pods in our airbus aircraft that provide long haul service exceeding the minimum rest requirement rules 
we expect to continue incurring expenses to comply with applicable regulations 
we cannot predict the impact that laws or regulations may have on our operations or assure you that laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect us 
many aspects of airlines operations also are subject to increasingly stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws protecting the environment 
us federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the airport noise and capacity act of  the clean air act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean water act  the safe drinking water act  the comprehensive environmental response act  and the compensation and liability act 
governments globally are increasingly focusing on the environmental impact caused by the consumption of fossil fuels and as a result have proposed or enacted legislation which may increase the cost of providing airline service or restrict its provision 
we expect the focus on environmental matters to increase 
future regulatory developments in the us and abroad could adversely affect operations and increase operating costs in the airline industry 
for example  potential future actions that may be taken by the us government  foreign governments  or the international civil aviation organization to limit the emission of greenhouse gases by the aviation sector are unknown at this time  but the effect on us and our industry is likely to be adverse and could be significant 
the us congress is considering climate change legislation and the environmental protection agency issued a rule which regulates larger emitters of greenhouse gases 
we cannot predict the impact that future environment regulations may have on our operations or assure you that regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect us 
the impact to us and our industry from such actions is likely to be adverse and could be significant  particularly if regulators were to conclude that emissions from commercial aircraft cause significant harm to the upper atmosphere or have a greater impact on climate change than other industries 
our operations may be adversely affected by its expansion into non us jurisdictions and the related increase in laws to which it is subject 
the expansion of our operations into non us jurisdictions has expanded the scope of the laws to which we are subject  both domestically and internationally 
in addition  operations in non us jurisdictions are in many cases subject to the laws of those jurisdictions rather than us laws 
laws in 
table of contents some jurisdictions differ in significant respects from those in the united states  and these differences can affect our ability to react to changes in our business 
further  enforcement of laws in some jurisdictions can be inconsistent and unpredictable  which can affect our ability to enforce our rights and to undertake activities that we believe are beneficial to our business 
as a result  our ability to generate revenue and the expenses paid in non us jurisdictions may differ from what would be expected if us law governed these operations 
our financial results may be negatively affected by increased airport rent rates and landing fees at the airports within the state of hawaii as a result of the state modernization plan 
the state of hawaii has begun to implement a modernization plan encompassing the airports we serve within the state 
our landing fees and airport rent rates have increased to fund the modernization program 
additionally  we expect the costs for our neighbor island operations to increase more than the costs related to our north america and international operations due to phased adjustments to the airport funding mechanism 
therefore  costs related to the modernization program will have a greater impact on our operations as compared to our competitors  whom do not have significant neighbor island operations 
we can offer no assurance that we will be successful in offsetting these cost increases through other cost reductions or increases in our revenue and  therefore  can offer no assurance that our future financial results will not be negatively affected by them 
our insurance costs are susceptible to significant increases and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we carry types and amounts of insurance customary in the airline industry  including coverage for general liability  passenger liability  property damage  aircraft loss or damage  baggage and cargo liability and workers compensation 
we are required by the dot to carry liability insurance on each of our aircraft 
we currently maintain commercial airline insurance with a major group of independent insurers that regularly participate in world aviation insurance markets  including public liability insurance and coverage for losses resulting from the physical destruction or damage to our aircraft 
however  there can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not be changed or that we will not bear substantial losses from accidents or damage to  or loss of  aircraft or other property due to other factors such as natural disasters 
we could incur substantial claims resulting from an accident or damage to  or loss of  aircraft or other property due to other factors such as natural disasters in excess of related insurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
after the events of september   aviation insurers significantly reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage available to commercial air carriers for liability to persons other than employees or passengers for claims resulting from acts of terrorism  war or similar events war risk coverage 
at the same time  they significantly increased the premiums for such coverage as well as for aviation insurance in general 
as a result  war risk insurance in amounts necessary for our operations  and at premiums that are not excessive  is not currently available in the commercial insurance market and we have therefore purchased from the us government third party war risk insurance coverage 
should the government discontinue this coverage  obtaining comparable coverage from commercial underwriters could result in substantially higher premiums and more restrictive terms  if it is available at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate war risk insurances our business could be materially and adversely affected

this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections of future events 
however  our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein as a result of the risks that we face  including but not limited to those risks stated in risk factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  above 
in addition  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our business our goal is to be the number one destination carrier serving hawaii 
we are a leisure airline devoted to the travel needs of the residents and visitors of hawaii and offer a unique travel experience 
we are strongly rooted in the culture and people of hawaii and seek to provide quality service to our customers which exemplifies the spirit of aloha 
we currently operate a fleet of boeing aircraft  boeing aircraft  and nine airbus a aircraft serving domestic and international destinations 
the company also has two atr turboprop aircraft for pending service to new neighbor island destinations in we are the state longest serving airline  as well as the largest provider of passenger air service within hawaii neighbor island and to hawaii from the state primary visitor markets in the us mainland north america 
we offer non stop service to hawaii from more us gateway cities than any other airline  as well as service to japan  south korea  the philippines  australia  american samoa  and tahiti  and also provide approximately daily flights between the hawaiian islands 
our revenue is derived primarily from transporting passengers on our aircraft 
revenue is recognized when either the transportation is provided or when the related ticket expires unused 
we measure capacity in terms of available seat miles asms  which represent the number of seats available for passengers multiplied by the number of miles the seats are flown 
yield  or the average amount one passenger pays to fly one mile  is calculated by dividing passenger revenue by revenue passenger miles rpms 
we strive to increase passenger revenue primarily by increasing our yield per flight or by filling a higher proportion of available seats  which produces higher revenue per available seat mile 
table of contents rasm 
other revenue primarily consists of baggage fees  cargo revenue  ticket change and cancellation fees  incidental services revenue  sale of frequent flyer miles  revenue earned on reduced rate passengers  inflight revenue  contract services and charter services revenue 
the largest components of our operating expenses are aircraft fuel including taxes and oil  wages and benefits provided to our employees and aircraft maintenance materials and repairs 
the price and availability of aircraft fuel is extremely volatile due to global economic and geopolitical factors that we can neither control nor accurately predict 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed when incurred unless covered by third party power by the hour services contracts

expanded our operations at hawaii second largest airport to create a new maui hub offering improved connections between maui and neighbor island destinations  as well as flights to and from the west coast 
in  we focused on our international expansion with the addition of new non stop international routes from honolulu to fukuoka  japan  brisbane  australia and sapporo  japan and increased frequency to daily on our routes to sydney  australia may and seoul  south korea july 
we continue to diversify our mix of passenger revenue and have increased our international revenue by to of total passenger revenue compared to in  we launched new non stop service from honolulu to new york city  new york

in  we introduced our new maui hub offering improved connections between maui and neighbor island destinations  as well as flights to and from the west coast  and launched a neighbor island travel program offering a specialized fare structure designed to stimulate increased travel for the residents of hawaii 
we continue to search for ways to provide value to both our customers and our business on our neighbor island routes as we maintain a significant presence and market share on these routes 
we took delivery and placed into revenue service four airbus a aircraft for service on our north america and international routes and two boeing aircraft for service on our neighbor island routes 
the company also took delivery of two atr turboprop aircraft with service on our neighbor island routes previously unserved by us to begin in we financed two of the airbus a aircraft under secured debt and two airbus a aircraft under lease agreements  and both boeing aircraft under lease agreements  and did not finance our atr turboprop aircraft which resulted in a decrease in our unrestricted cash 
in january  we signed a memorandum of understanding for the purchase of new airbus aneo aircraft scheduled for delivery between and  with rights to purchase an additional nine aircraft 
we plan to execute a purchase agreement in the first quarter of the aneo aircraft will be used to complement hawaiian existing fleet of wide body aircraft for travel to the west coast on our north america routes 
these aircraft are excluded from the table below 
the table below summarizes our total fleet as of december   and expected based on existing agreements december  december  december  aircraft type leased owned total leased owned total leased owned total a er atr total the atr turboprop aircraft are owned by hawaiian holdings  inc subsidiary and are expected to begin operations on neighbor island routes previously unserved by us in 
table of contents the decrease in the number of leased er aircraft from to is due to the return of leased aircraft at the end of their lease terms 
the decrease in the number of owned er aircraft from to is due to the planned retirement of one aircraft at the end of its estimated useful life 
in  we entered into a commitment to assign the purchase of two a aircraft at delivery and simultaneously enter into lease agreements for the respective aircraft with scheduled delivery dates in currently these two aircraft are reported as leased in the table above 
see note commitments and contingencies for further discussion on the purchase aircraft and lease financing agreement 
leased aircraft include both aircraft under capital and operating leases

results of operations our consolidated net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in and net income of million  or per diluted share  in significant items impacting the comparability between the periods are as follows all periods include adjustments to reflect the timing of unrealized mark to market gains or losses related to our outstanding fuel hedge positions 
our results reflect a million non recurring  pre tax lease termination charge related to the purchase of fifteen boeing aircraft previously under lease agreements 
our results reflect a tax benefit of million from the release of our entire remaining tax valuation allowance of million 
adjusted non gaap results and per share amounts we believe the disclosure of non gaap financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because we believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by industry analysts and investors  our results excluding these items are often used in management and board of director decision making analysis  it is useful to monitor performance without these items as it improves a reader ability to compare our results to other airlines  and it is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly earnings press releases

passenger revenue passenger revenue increased over the past three years to billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in passenger revenue of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  is primarily due to increased capacity across our network with a flat overall yield as we faced increased competition on certain of our north america and international routes  which led to a decreased load factor and decreased average fare throughout our network 
the increase in passenger revenue of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to  is primarily due to increased yield throughout our network and increased capacity on our north america and international routes due to increased demand which led to an increased load factor and increased average fare throughout our network

we expect operating expenses to increase with the continued expansion of our services and the increase in the number of aircraft in our fleet 
aircraft fuel aircraft fuel expense increased during each of the past three years due to a combination of an increase in fuel price and an increase in consumption as illustrated in the following table year ended december  change from year ended in thousands  except per gallon amounts fuel gallons consumed fuel price per gallon  including taxes and delivery aircraft fuel expense 
table of contents the increase in fuel expense from to is primarily due to an increase in fuel consumption due to the additional aircraft in the fleet four additional a and two additional b aircraft 
the increase in fuel expense from to is due to an increase in fuel price and an increase in consumption of fuel due to the additional aircraft in the fleet four additional a aircraft and one additional b partially offset by two b returned at the end of their lease terms

we recorded losses on fuel derivatives of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to gains of million recorded for the year ended december  we believe economic fuel expense is the best measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for our operations in a period and is consistent with how management manages our business and assesses our operating performance 
we define economic fuel expense as raw fuel expense plus gains losses realized through actual cash payments to receipts from hedge counterparties for fuel derivatives settled in the period inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums 
economic fuel expense for the year ended  and is calculated as follows year ended december  change from year ended in thousands  except per gallon amounts aircraft fuel expense  including taxes and oil realized gains losses on settlement of fuel derivative contracts economic fuel expense gallons of jet fuel consumed economic fuel costs per gallon see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  for additional discussion of our jet fuel costs and related derivative program 
wages and benefits wages and benefits expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to an increase in the number of employees as we continue to expand our operations with additional aircraft and new routes as well as an increase in our pension and other post retirement expenses due to a decrease in the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit expense  a decrease in the long term expected rate of return of assets and an increase in claims costs 
there were no significant changes to wages and benefits expense from to we expect wages and benefits expense to increase in future periods as we continue to add additional employees for the expansion of our operations 
aircraft rent aircraft rent expense decreased by million  or  in  as compared to  due to the full year impact of aircraft leases that ended in  the purchase of our existing fleet of boeing aircraft in june of which the majority were previously under operating lease agreements and the return of two boeing er aircraft at the end of their lease terms in may and october 
table of contents the aircraft leases that ended in were partially offset by the addition of two aircraft under operating lease agreements one b aircraft in december and one a aircraft in may 
aircraft rent expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to the entire year to date recognition of aircraft rent expense for three leased airbus a aircraft leases commenced in april  may and november and lease return costs incurred with the return of the two leased boeing aircraft in may and october this increase was offset by the purchase of our fleet of boeing aircraft in june  of which the majority were previously under operating lease agreements 
we expect rent expense to increase in future periods as we expand our fleet and the potential addition of aircraft under operating leases 
maintenance materials and repairs maintenance materials and repairs expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to increased power by the hour pbh expenses for the a aircraft and b aircraft fleet additions during  partially offset by decreased maintenance expense for our b due to the non recurrence of year airframe checks incurred in and decreased maintenance expense for our b aircraft due to the non recurrence of several heavy maintenance checks incurred in maintenance materials and repairs expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to increased pbh expenses for the airbus a fleet additions during  increases in our pbh rates for our boeing and boeing aircraft  increased maintenance expense on our boeing aircraft and engines and increased heavy maintenance expense on our boeing aircraft due to the continuation of year airframe checks on this fleet 
we expect maintenance materials and repairs expense to increase in future periods as we continue to integrate additional aircraft into revenue service  and as a result of price escalation imposed in certain of our pbh contracts 
aircraft and passenger servicing aircraft and passenger servicing expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  and million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to volume related increases as well as increased service costs on our international routes 
we expect aircraft and passenger servicing expense to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our fleet and add additional routes 
commissions and other selling expenses commissions and other selling expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  and million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to increases in volume related selling expenses  which include increased travel agency commissions and increases in the volume of tickets purchased through credit cards and global distribution systems 
we expect commissions and other selling expenses to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our fleet and add additional routes 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to the increase in the number of owned aircraft and aircraft under capital leases from there were no significant changes to depreciation and amortization expense from to other rentals and landing fees other rentals and landing fee expense increased by million  or  in  as compared to  primarily due to increased rent expense and landing fees with the addition of new routes and increased frequencies on our existing routes since and increased rent expense at several of our existing locations 
other rentals and landing fee expense increased by million  or  in as compared to  primarily due to increases in joint use and space rent at our hawaii airports and increases in rent expense and landing fees due to the addition of new routes in and we expect expenses for other rentals and landing fees to increase in future periods as we continue to add additional routes and increase frequency on our existing routes 
lease termination during  we entered into a purchase agreement with the lessor for the purchase of fifteen boeing aircraft  each such aircraft including two rolls royce br engines  previously held through four capital and eleven operating lease agreements 
the purchase price for the fifteen boeing aircraft was million  comprised of financing of million through secured loan agreements  cash payment of million  and non cash application of maintenance and security deposits held by the previous lessor and current debt financier of million 
we recognized the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the aircraft under operating leases as a cost of terminating the leases under asc leases and elected to apply the same accounting policy to the aircraft under capital leases 
we recorded the fifteen boeing aircraft at its fair value of million on the december  consolidated balance sheets and reflected lease termination charges of million on the december  consolidated statements of operations 
the purchase of the fifteen boeing aircraft resulted in lower aircraft rent expense in and  which was partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization and interest expense 
operating costs per available seat mile casm we have listed separately in the table below our fuel costs per asm and our non gaap unit costs  excluding fuel and the non recurring lease termination charge in these amounts are included in casm  but for internal purposes we consistently use unit cost metrics that exclude fuel and non recurring items to measure and monitor our costs

the year over year increases are primarily due to the increased interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs due to the additional financings we entered into each year  which was partially offset by increased capitalized interest 
the further increase in nonoperating expense in and is due to losses incurred on fuel derivatives 
income tax benefit expense we recorded income tax expense of million and million during and  respectively  and an income tax benefit of million during during  we had an effective tax rate of which did not significantly differ from the us federal statutory rate of 
our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate due to the impact that forecasted permanent tax differences had on our full year financial projections 
the income tax benefit recorded in was primarily driven by the release of our valuation allowance 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity is dependent on the cash we generate from operating activities and our debt financing arrangements 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  representing an increase of million from december  as of december  our restricted cash balance  which consisted of cash held as collateral by entities that process our credit card transactions for advance ticket sales  was million  a decrease of million from 
table of contents december   due to a decrease in the cash holdback on our primary credit card processing agreement 
we have been able to generate sufficient funds from our operations to meet our working capital requirements and typically finance our aircraft through secured debt and lease financings 
at december   hawaiian had approximately million of debt and capital lease obligations  including approximately million that will become due in the next months 
hawaiian has a secured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility in an amount of up to million  and as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility and million available net of various outstanding letters of credit 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities increased to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase from to in cash provided was primarily due to an increase in our air traffic liability balance for increased future bookings related to advance ticket sales  increases in accounts payable and increases in other accrued liabilities and partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and long term prepayments and other 
the increase from to is primarily due to increases in our air traffic liability balance for increased future bookings related to advance ticket sales and a decrease in contributions to our pension and disability plans that was partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities increased in the past three years to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase from to is primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment partially offset by decreases in pre delivery deposits for upcoming aircraft and engine deliveries 
the increase from to is primarily due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment which was partially offset by the net sale of investments in of million  including million for the sale of our auction rate securities 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the net cash provided by financing activities from to is primarily due to decreases in cash repayments for debt and capital lease obligations and decreases in the proceeds received from debt issuances 
the change from to was due to an increase in proceeds received from debt issuances including aircraft facility agreements and the convertible notes  decreases in cash repayments for debt and capital lease obligations and the million repurchase of treasury stock in capital commitments as of december   the company had capital commitments for aircraft and aircraft related equipment which included firm aircraft orders for thirteen airbus a aircraft for delivery between and  six airbus axwb aircraft for delivery beginning in and four rolls royce spare engines scheduled for delivery through in addition  hawaiian has purchase rights for an additional three a aircraft and six a xwb aircraft 
committed expenditures for these aircraft  engines and related flight equipment is approximately million in  million in  million in  million in million in and million thereafter 
for  we expect our other non aircraft related capital expenditures  which include software  improvements  ramp and maintenance equipment to total approximately million to million 
in order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs  we must secure acceptable financing 
we are currently exploring various financing alternatives and  while we believe that such financing will be available to us  there can be no assurance that financing will be available when required  or on acceptable terms  or at all 
the inability to secure such financing could have a material

stock purchases under the program could be made through the open market  established plans or through privately negotiated transactions  as market conditions permitted 
the stock repurchase program was substantially completed in september  we repurchased an aggregate of  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
the shares were subsequently retired in covenants under our financing arrangements the terms of certain of our financing agreements restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  grant liens  merge or consolidate  dispose of assets  prepay indebtedness  make investments  make acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  pay dividends or make distributions to our parent company and repurchase stock 
these agreements also require us to meet certain financial covenants 
these financial tests include maintaining a minimum amount of unrestricted cash and achieving certain levels of fixed charge coverage 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
if we are not able to comply with these covenants in the future  our outstanding obligations under these facilities could be accelerated and become due and payable immediately 
under our bank issued credit card processing agreements  certain proceeds from advance ticket sales are held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur 
these holdbacks  which are included in restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets  totaled million at december  and million at december  there were no amounts subject to this holdback at december  as of december   the holdback was of the applicable credit card air traffic liability 
in  we entered into an amendment with our largest credit card processor that eliminates the financial triggers for additional holdbacks 
in the event of a material adverse change in the business  the holdback could increase to an amount up to of the applicable credit card air traffic liability  which could also cause an increase in the level of restricted cash 
there were no amounts subject to this holdback at december  if we are unable to obtain a waiver of  or otherwise mitigate the increase in the amount of restricted cash  it could also cause a covenant violation under our other debt or lease obligations and have a material adverse impact on us 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan funding as of december   the excess of the projected benefit obligations over the fair value of plan assets was approximately million 
we contributed million  million and million  to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan during  and  respectively  satisfying our minimum required plan year contributions 
future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates  funded status  applicable regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns 
in  our minimum required contribution to our defined benefit pension plans and disability plan is million 

table of contents income tax net operating loss carryforwards we have net operating loss nols carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million 
these nol carryforwards are primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft  resulting in a tax benefit of million at december   substantially all of which will not begin to expire until as we expect to report operating profits in future years  we cannot be assured our nols will be sufficient to offset net income and we will likely be required to pay income taxes 
we believe we will have sufficient working capital to pay taxes as they becomes due  although we cannot be assured actual taxes incurred in these years will not exceed our expectations 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has i made guarantees  ii retained a contingent interest in transferred assets  iii an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity or iv any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging or research and development arrangements with the company 
we have no arrangements of the types described in the first three categories that we believe may have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we do have obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities related to certain aircraft leases 
to the extent our leases and related guarantees are with a separate legal entity other than a governmental entity  we are not the primary beneficiary because the lease terms are consistent with market terms at the inception of the lease  and the lease does not include a residual value guarantee  fixed price purchase option or similar feature 
contractual obligations our estimated contractual obligations as of december  are summarized in the following table contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt and capital lease obligations operating leases aircraft and related equipment operating leases non aircraft purchase commitments capital purchase commitments operating projected employee benefit contributions total contractual obligations amounts represent contractual amounts due  including interest

the amounts in the table above exclude our memorandum of understanding for the purchase of airbus aneo aircraft  amounts include commitments for services provided by third parties for aircraft maintenance for our airbus fleet  accounting  it and reservations 
total contractual obligations do not include long term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature with no minimum guarantee  such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees due under other agreements such as aircraft maintenance power by the hour  computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements  or when the agreements contain short term cancellation provisions 
amounts include our estimated contributions to our pension plans based on actuarially determined estimates and our pilots disability plan 
amounts are subject to change based on numerous factors  including interest rate levels  the amount and timing of asset returns and the impact of future legislation 
we are currently unable to estimate the projected contributions beyond critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those accounting policies and accounting estimates that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and that potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
frequent flyer accounting hawaiianmiles  hawaiian frequent flyer travel award program  provides a variety of awards to program members based on accumulated mileage 
we utilize the incremental cost method of accounting for free travel awards earned in connection with the purchase of passenger tickets which utilizes a number of estimates including the incremental cost per mile and breakage 
we record a liability for the estimated incremental cost of providing travel awards that are expected to be redeemed on hawaiian or the contractual rate of expected redemption on partner airlines 
we estimate the incremental cost of travel awards based on periodic studies of actual costs and apply these cost estimates to all issued miles  less an appropriate breakage factor for estimated miles that will not be redeemed 
incremental cost includes the costs of fuel  meals and beverages  insurance and certain other passenger traffic related costs  but does not include any costs for aircraft ownership and maintenance 
the breakage factor is estimated based on an analysis of historical expirations 
we also sell mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program 
these sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  with one element representing the travel that will ultimately be provided when the mileage credits are redeemed and the other consisting of marketing related activities that we conduct with the participating company 
the estimated fair value of the transportation portion of these mileage credits is deferred and recognized as passenger revenue over the period when transportation is expected to be provided currently estimated at months 
amounts received in excess of the expected transportation fair value are recognized immediately as other revenue at the time of sale as compensation for marketing services performed 
the estimated fair value 
table of contents of the air transportation component is based on several factors  including the equivalent ticket value of similar company fares and customer habits in redeeming free travel awards 
under the programs of certain participating companies  credits are accumulated in accounts maintained by the participating company  then transferred into a member hawaiianmiles account for immediate redemption of free travel awards 
for those transactions  revenue is amortized over the period during which the mileage is projected to be used currently estimated at five months 
on a periodic basis  we review and update the assumptions used in our frequent flyer accounting 
on an annual basis  we update the deferral period and deferral rate for mileage credits sold to participating companies 
we also update the incremental cost assumption quarterly and the breakage rate assumption annually for free travel awards earned in connection with the purchase of passenger tickets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a net frequent flyer pre tax adjustment of million to correct an error in the accounting for our sale of mileage credits to companies participating in our frequent flyer program that are deferred and recognized as passenger revenue 
the correction resulted in a change in the deferral period from to months 
the error primarily relates to prior periods and the impact of the error was not material to any prior period or the fiscal year 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we account for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement and postemployment plans in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits asc 
asc requires companies to measure their plans assets and obligations to determine the funded status at fiscal year end  reflect the funded status in the statement of financial position as an asset or liability  and recognize changes in the funded status of the plans in comprehensive income during the year in which the changes occur 
asc does not change the amount of net periodic benefit expense recognized in our results of operations 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses are recognized on an accrual basis over each employee service periods 
pension expense is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
we have elected temporary airline relief with regard to applying the funding rules for our qualified pension plans 
this relief allows cash contribution requirements to be developed using rules that currently produce lower and more stable contribution requirements than available without this relief  however  this may not be the case throughout the relief period 
this relief expires in for the salaried and iam pension plans and for the pilots pension plan 
the calculation of pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit expenses and its corresponding liabilities require the use of significant assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the expected health care cost trend rate 
changes in these assumptions will impact the expense and liability amounts  and future actual 
table of contents experience may differ from these assumptions 
the assumptions as of december  are as follows pension discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation expected return on plan assets pilot retirement age postretirement discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation expected return on plan assets n a n a n a expected health care cost trend rate initial ultimate years to reach ultimate trend rate disability discount rate to determine projected benefit obligation expected return on plan assets n a not applicable expected return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit expense for changed to for the pension plans and for the disability plan 
represents the expected health care cost trend rate to determine the projected benefit obligation 
the health care cost trend rate used to determine the projected benefit expense was assumed to be and to decrease gradually to in the expected long term rate of return assumption is developed by evaluating input from the trustee managing the plans assets  including the trustee review of asset class return expectations by several consultants and economists  as well as long term inflation assumptions 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of assets  which is based on our goal of earning the highest rate of return while maintaining risk at acceptable levels 
the plan strives to sufficiently diversify assets so that adverse or unexpected results from one security class will not have an unduly detrimental impact on the entire portfolio 
our expected long term rate of return by category at december  is as follows expected long term rate of return equity securities domestic equity securities foreign fixed income securities we believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation 
we periodically review our actual asset allocation and will rebalance the pension plan investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets by one percent from to and on our disability benefit plan assets from to 
table of contents would increase our estimated pension and disability benefit expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
we determine the appropriate discount rate for each of our plans based on current rates on high quality corporate bonds that would generate the cash flow necessary to pay plan benefits when due 
the pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and future expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by one percent would increase our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities at december  by approximately million and million  respectively  and would increase our estimated pension and other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
the health care cost trend rate is based upon an evaluation of the company historical trends and experience taking into account current and expected market conditions 
a one percent increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the other postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and our estimated other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
a one percent decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would decrease the other postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and our estimated other postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
future changes in plan asset returns  plan provisions  assumed discount rates  pilot estimated retirement age  pension funding legislation and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future retirement benefit expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
aircraft maintenance and repair costs maintenance and repair costs for owned and leased flight equipment  including the overhaul of aircraft components  are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
engine overhaul costs covered by power by the hour arrangements are paid and expensed as incurred and are based on the amount of hours flown per contract 
under the terms of our power by the hour agreements  we pay a set dollar amount per engine hour flown on a monthly basis and the third party vendor assumes the obligation to repair the engines at no additional cost to us  subject to certain specified exclusions 
additionally  although our aircraft lease agreements specifically provide that we  as lessee  are responsible for maintenance of the leased aircraft  we do  under our existing aircraft lease agreements  pay maintenance reserves to aircraft lessors that are applied towards the cost of future maintenance events 
these reserves are calculated based on a performance measure  such as flight hours  and are available for reimbursement to us upon the completion of the maintenance of the leased aircraft 
if there are sufficient funds on deposit to reimburse us for the invoices initially paid by us and then submitted to the lessor  they are reimbursed to us 
however  reimbursements are limited to the available deposits associated with the specific maintenance activity for which we are requesting reimbursement 
under certain of our existing aircraft lease agreements  if there are excess amounts on deposit at the expiration of the lease  the lessor is entitled to retain any excess amounts  whereas at the expiration of certain other of our existing aircraft lease agreements any such excess amounts are returned to us  provided that we have fulfilled all of our obligations under the lease agreements 
the maintenance reserves paid under our lease agreements do not transfer either the obligation to maintain the aircraft or the cost risk associated with the maintenance activities to the aircraft lessor 
in addition  we maintain the right to select any third party maintenance provider 
therefore  we record these amounts as a deposit on our balance sheet and then recognize maintenance expense when the underlying maintenance is performed  in accordance with our maintenance accounting policy 
in accordance with asc  on a quarterly basis we complete a forecast of maintenance costs for the next scheduled event on applicable leased aircraft and compare these estimates to our forecasted 
table of contents nonrefundable deposits to identify costs not expected to be recoverable 
any costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset 
therefore  we bifurcate and expense the proportionate share that is estimated to not be recoverable from existing and future nonrefundable deposits 
in determining whether it is probable that maintenance deposits will be used to fund the cost of the maintenance events  we conduct the following analysis we evaluate the aircraft condition  including the airframe  the engines  the auxiliary power unit and the landing gear 
we then project future usage of the aircraft during the term of the lease based on our business and fleet plan 
we estimate the cost of performing the next scheduled maintenance event 
these estimates are based on the experience of our maintenance personnel and available industry data  including historical fleet operating statistic reports published by the aircraft and engine manufacturers 
we compare the forecasted maintenance deposits to be paid at the time of the next scheduled maintenance event to the estimated cost of the next scheduled maintenance event 
those costs not expected to be recoverable are considered to be not substantially and contractually related to maintenance of the leased asset 
we prospectively account for any changes in estimates 
our assessment of the recoverability of our maintenance deposits is subject to change in the event that key estimates and assumptions change over time 
those key estimates and assumptions include our fleet plan and the projected total cost and  to a lesser extent  anticipated timing of the major maintenance activities covered by the maintenance reserves 
based on current market conditions  we believe that further significant changes in our fleet plan are unlikely 
furthermore  based on historical trends and future projections  including those published by the manufacturers of our aircraft and engines  we believe it is unlikely that future maintenance costs for our aircraft will decline to such an extent that the maintenance deposits currently recorded on our consolidated balance sheets would not be used to fund the cost of future maintenance events and  therefore  not be recoverable 
tax valuation allowance in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of hawaiian deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of hawaiian deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we continue to believe our projections of future taxable income are sufficient to support recognition of our deferred tax assets 
as of december   we do not have a tax valuation allowance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks  including commodity price risk ie  jet fuel prices and interest rate risk 
we have market sensitive instruments in the form of financial derivatives used to hedge hawaiian exposure to increases in jet fuel prices and variable rate debt 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to market risk due to the variability of interest rates 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented does not consider the effects of such adverse changes on the overall economy nor does it consider additional actions we may undertake to mitigate exposure to such adverse changes 
actual results may differ 
see discussion of critical accounting policies above for additional information over these financial instruments 
aircraft fuel costs aircraft fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our operating expense 
fuel costs represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
based on gallons expected to be consumed in  for every one cent increase in the cost of jet fuel  our annual fuel expense would increase by approximately million 
we periodically enter into derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to changes in the prices of jet fuel 
during  our fuel hedge program primarily consisted of heating oil  wti and brent crude oil call options and collars 
call option contracts provide for a settlement in favor of the holder  while put option contracts provide settlement in favor of the owner in the event that prices exceed a predetermined contractual level during a particular time period 
we have combined some of our call option contracts with put option contract sales to create collars whereby a settlement may occur in our favor in the event prices for the underlying commodity exceed a predetermined contractual level the call option strike price during a particular time period or a settlement may be required from us in favor of our counterparty in the event that prices of the commodity fall below a predetermined contractual level the put option strike price 
the aforementioned fuel derivative financial instruments were not designated as hedges under asc as of december   the fair value of these fuel derivatives reflected a net asset of million  and is reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets

we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit risks in the event our counterparties fail to meet their obligations  however  we do not expect these counterparties to fail to meet their obligations 
interest rates our results of operations are affected by fluctuations in interest rates due to our variable rate debt and interest income earned on our cash deposits 
our variable rate debt agreements include the revolving credit facility we had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  and and a secured loan agreement  the terms of which are discussed in note debt to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents at december   we had million of variable rate debt indexed to the following interest rate index rate one month libor changes in market interest rates have a direct and corresponding effect on our pre tax earnings and cash flows associated with our variable rate debt and interest bearing cash accounts 
based on the balances of our cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  and variable rate debt as of december   a change in interest rates is unlikely to have a material impact on our results of operations 
as of december  and  we did not have any interest rate hedges 
at december   we had million of fixed rate debt including aircraft capital lease obligations  convertible notes and facility agreements for aircraft purchases  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk for fixed rate long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent decrease in interest rates  and amounted to approximately million as of december  foreign currency we generate revenues and incur expenses in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations through changes in the dollar value of foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen 
based on expected revenues and expenses denominated in japanese yen  a strengthening in value of the us dollar  relative to the japanese yen  would result in a decrease in operating income of approximately million  net of gain relizable from yen hedges discussed below 
the variance is due to our japanese yen denominated revenues exceeding our japanese yen denominated expenses 
at december  and  we did not have any foreign currency hedges 
in january  we entered into forward contracts for the purchase of japanese yen 
as of february   we had forward contracts covering approximately of our anticipated yen sales in at an average rate of yen per us dollar
