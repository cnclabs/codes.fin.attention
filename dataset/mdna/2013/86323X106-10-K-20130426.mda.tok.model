as a result  period to period comparisons may not be meaningful with respect to the past operations nor are they necessarily indicative of the future operations of the company in the near or long term 
the data in the table is presented solely for the purpose of reflecting the relationship of various operating elements to revenues for the periods indicated

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company learned that ge healthcare was shifting its organizational focus to upgrading its current clients to their latest version software to assist its clients in meeting meaningful use criteria under the hitech act 
this understanding continues through january  the company s remarketing agreement with ge healthcare remains in effect  however the company did not obtain any net new clients from the relationship in fiscal or the opportunity to sell into ge healthcare s current client base that does not have the company s solutions remains  as well as the continuing ability to sell additional solutions and services into the existing jointly owned client base through the remarketing agreement 
all signed contracts or purchase orders with ge healthcare to purchase proprietary software  saas  professional services  and maintenance  are expected to be fully honored 
cost of sales fiscal year in thousands change change cost of systems sales cost of professional services cost of maintenance and support cost of software as a service total cost of sales cost of systems sales includes amortization and impairment of capitalized software expenditures  royalties  and the cost of third party hardware and software 
cost of systems sales  as a percentage of systems sales  varies from period to period depending on hardware and software configurations of the systems sold 
the relatively fixed cost of the capitalized software amortization  without the addition of any impairment charges  compared to the variable nature of system sales causes these percentages to vary dramatically 
the increase in fiscal cost of sales is primarily the result of amortization of software acquired as part of the meta acquisition of the cost of professional services includes compensation and benefits for personnel  and related expenses 
the increase in expense is primarily due to additional costs associated with the interpoint and meta acquisitions 
the cost of maintenance and support includes compensation and benefits for client support personnel and the cost of third party maintenance contracts 
these increases are primarily due to additional maintenance and support costs as part of the meta acquisition 
the cost of software as a service is relatively fixed  but subject to inflation for the goods and services it requires 
the increase is related to depreciation of new equipment and new third party maintenance contracts from infrastructure spending as 
index to financial statements the company added new or add on saas contracts  as well as the inclusion of interpoint operations and amortization of the acquired software development costs for a full year 
selling  general and administrative expense fiscal year in thousands change change general and administrative expenses sales and marketing expenses total selling  general  and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits and reimbursable travel and living expenses related to the company s executive and administrative staff  general corporate expenses  amortization of intangible assets  and occupancy costs 
the increase over the prior year is primarily due to transaction costs associated with the meta acquisition of  as well as additional general and administrative expenses associated with the meta operations 
amortization of intangible assets added incremental expense to fiscal due to the amortization of assets acquired as part of the acquisition of interpoint and meta 
we recognized approximately  in amortization expense in fiscal for acquired intangible assets as compared to  in the fiscal sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits and reimbursable travel and living expenses related to the company s sales and marketing staff  advertising and marketing expenses  including trade shows and similar type sales and marketing expenses 
the slight increase in sales and marketing expense reflects an increase in total compensation for sales staff 
product research and development fiscal year in thousands change change research and development expense capitalized research and development cost total r d cost product research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefits  the use of independent contractors for specific near term development projects  and an allocated portion of general overhead costs  including occupancy 
research and development expense increased due to higher support for newly released software versions  which also decreased the number of hours available to be capitalized  which is reflected in the capitalized research and development costs 
research and development expenses in fiscal and  as a percentage of revenues  were and  respectively 
other income expense interest expense in fiscal was  compared to  in fiscal interest expense consists of interest and commitment fees on the line of credit  interest including accruals for success fees on the term loans entered into in conjunction with the interpoint and meta acquisitions  interest on the convertible note entered into in conjunction with the interpoint acquisition  and is inclusive of  in deferred financing cost amortization 
interest expense increased during primarily because of the increases from the term loan interest and success fees  and deferred financing costs related to the meta acquisition 
the company recorded losses on the conversion of the convertible subordinated notes of  and  related to the interpoint and private placement investment  respectively 
the company also recorded a valuation adjustment to its warrants liability  recorded as miscellaneous income of  using assumptions made by management to adjust to the current fair market value of the warrants at january  provision for income taxes the company recorded a tax benefit of  at january  which is comprised of current state and local taxes payable of approximately  and deferred tax benefit of approximately  the deferred tax benefit comprised of the tax benefit recorded for the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance and the related reduction in 
index to financial statements income tax expense of approximately  as a result of deferred tax liabilities recorded related to the meta acquisition  and the effect of temporary differences during fiscal the tax provision of  for fiscal consists of state and local taxes  and alternative minimum tax 
the company determined it was more likely than not that the deferred tax amount will not be realized 
backlog company proprietary software hardware and third party software professional services maintenance and support software as a service total at january  the company had master agreements and purchase orders from clients and remarketing partners for systems and related services which have not been delivered or installed which  if fully performed  would generate future revenues of approximately  compared with  at january  the company s proprietary software backlog consists of signed agreements to purchase software licenses and term licenses 
typically  this is software that is not yet generally available  or the software is generally available and the client has not taken possession of the software 
third party hardware and software consists of signed agreements to purchase third party hardware or third party software licenses that have not been delivered to the client 
these are products that the company resells as components of the solution a client purchases 
the increase in backlog is primarily due to three clients which have made purchases for future systems implementations 
these items are expected to be delivered in the next twelve months as implementations commence 
professional services backlog consists of signed contracts for services that have yet to be performed 
typically backlog is recognized within twelve months of the contract signing 
the increase in backlog is due to several clients that signed contracts during fiscal for add on solutions  upgrades  or expansion of services at additional locations for which contracted services have not yet been performed 
maintenance and support backlog consists of maintenance agreements for licenses of the company s proprietary software and third party hardware and software with clients and remarketing partners for which either an agreement has been signed or a purchase order under a master agreement has been received 
the company includes in backlog the signed agreements through their respective renewal dates 
typical maintenance contracts are for a one year term and are renewed annually 
clients typically prepay maintenance and support which is billed days prior to the beginning of the maintenance period 
the company does not expect any significant client attrition over the next months 
maintenance and support backlog at january  was  as compared to  at january  the company expects to recognize approximately  out of january  backlog in fiscal a significant portion of this increase is due to backlog added by meta maintenance contracts 
additionally  as part of renewals contracts are typically subject to an annual increase in fees based on market rates and inflationary metrics 
at january   the company had entered into software as a service agreements  which are expected to generate revenues of  through their respective renewal dates in fiscal years through the company expects to recognize approximately  out of january  backlog in fiscal typical saas terms are one to seven years in length 
saas backlog and terms are as follows in thousands 
index to financial statements saas backlog at january  average remaining months in term year term year term year term year term less than year term total saas backlog the commencement of revenue recognition for saas varies depending on the size and complexity of the system  the implementation schedule requested by the client and ultimately the official go live on the system 
therefore  it is difficult for the company to accurately predict the revenue it expects to achieve in any particular period 
all of the company s master agreements are generally non cancelable but provide that the client may terminate its agreement upon a material breach by the company  or may delay certain aspects of the installation 
there can be no assurance that a client will not cancel all or any portion of a master agreement or delay portions of the agreement 
a termination or delay in one or more phases of an agreement  or the failure of the company to procure additional agreements  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  and results of operations 
use of non gaap financial measures in order to provide investors with greater insight  and allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management and the board of directors in its financial and operational decision making  the company may supplement the consolidated financial statements presented on a gaap basis in this annual report on form k with the following non gaap financial measures ebitda  adjusted ebitda  and adjusted ebitda margin 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap 
the company compensates for such limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using non gaap financial measures only as supplemental data 
we also provide a reconciliation of non gaap to gaap measures used 
investors are encouraged to carefully review this reconciliation 
in addition  because these non gaap measures are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  these measures  as defined by the company  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share the company defines i ebitda  as net earnings loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation and amortization  ii adjusted ebitda  as net earnings loss before net interest expense  income tax expense benefit  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense  and transaction expenses and other one time costs  iii adjusted ebitda margin  as adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net revenue  and iv adjusted ebitda per diluted share as adjusted ebitda divided by adjusted diluted shares outstanding 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda per diluted share are used to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period to period and provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than gaap measures alone 
these measures assist management and the board and may be useful to investors in comparing the company s operating performance consistently over time as they remove the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges  asset base primarily depreciation and amortization  items outside the control of the management team taxes  and costs that we expect to be non recurring including transaction related expenses such as professional and advisory services  corporate restructuring expenses such as severances  and other operating costs that are expected to be non recurring 
adjusted ebitda removes the impact of share based compensation expense  which is another non cash item 
adjusted ebitda per diluted share will include incremental shares in the share count that would be considered anti dilutive in a gaap net loss position 
the board of directors and management also use these measures as i one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating  on at least a quarterly and annual basis  actual results against such expectations  and  ii as a performance evaluation metric in determining achievement of certain executive and associate incentive compensation programs 

index to financial statements the company s lenders use adjusted ebitda to assess our operating performance 
the company s credit agreements with its lender require delivery of compliance reports certifying compliance with financial covenants certain of which are based on an adjusted ebitda measurement that is the same as the adjusted ebitda measurement reviewed by our management and board of directors 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not measures of liquidity under gaap  or otherwise  and are not alternatives to cash flow from continuing operating activities  despite the advantages regarding the use and analysis of these measures as mentioned above 
ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share as disclosed in this annual report on form k  have limitations as analytical tools  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of company results as reported under gaap  nor are these measures intended to be measures of liquidity or free cash flow for our discretionary use 
some of the limitations of ebitda  and its variations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements to service interest or principal payments under our credit agreement  ebitda does not reflect income tax payments we are required to make  and although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized often will have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements 
adjusted ebitda has all the inherent limitations of ebitda 
to properly and prudently evaluate our business  the company encourages readers to review the gaap financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
the company also strongly urges readers to review the reconciliation of gaap net earnings loss to adjusted ebitda  and gaap earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share in this section  along with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following table sets forth a reconciliation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net earnings loss  a comparable gaap based measure  as well as earnings loss per diluted share to adjusted ebitda per diluted share 
all of the items included in the reconciliation from net earnings loss to ebitda to adjusted ebitda and the related per share calculations are either recurring non cash items  or items that management does not consider in assessing the company s on going operating performance 
in the case of the non cash items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s comparative operating performance because the measures without such items are less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation  amortization and other non recurring expenses and more reflective of other factors that affect operating performance 
in the case of the other non recurring items  management believes that investors may find it useful to assess the company s operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 

index to financial statements the following table reconciles net earnings loss to ebitda  adjusted ebitda  adjusted ebitda margin  and adjusted ebitda per diluted share for the fiscal years ended january  and amounts in thousands  except per share data fiscal year adjusted ebitda reconciliation net earnings loss interest expense tax expenses depreciation amortization of capitalized software development costs amortization of intangible assets amortization of other costs ebitda stock based compensation expense loss on conversion of convertible notes transaction related professional fees  advisory fees  and other internal direct costs associate severances and other costs relating to transactions or corporate restructuring other non recurring operating expenses adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda per diluted share earnings loss per share diluted adjusted ebitda per adjusted diluted share diluted weighted average shares includable incremental shares adjusted ebitda adjusted diluted shares includes a non cash income tax benefit recorded of approximately  to reduce the company s tax valuation allowance relating to deferred tax liabilities recorded in conjunction with the company s acquisition of meta health technology 
includes  relating to internally developed legacy software   relating to acquired internally developed software from interpoint  and  relating to internally developed software acquired from meta health technology 
adjusted ebitda as a percentage of gaap revenues the number of incremental shares that would be dilutive under profit assumption  only applicable under a gaap net loss 
if gaap profit is earned in the current period  no additional incremental shares are assumed adjusted ebitda per adjusted diluted share for the company common stock is computed using the more dilutive of the two class method or the if converted method application of critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies 
see note b of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  software revenue recognition and asc revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the company commences revenue recognition when the following criteria all have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  
index to financial statements delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if the company determines that any of the above criteria has not been met  the company will defer recognition of the revenue until all the criteria have been met 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria  cancellation or right of refund terms are required  revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such criteria  as applicable 
multiple element arrangements we record revenue pursuant to accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
the company follows this accounting guidance for revenue recognition of multiple deliverable revenue arrangements meaning the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets to determine whether such arrangements contain more than one unit of accounting 
to qualify as a separate unit of accounting  the delivered item must have value to the client on a stand alone basis meaning the item can be sold separately by any vendor or the client could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
additionally  if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered items must be considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts and contract receivables are comprised of amounts owed the company for solutions and services provided 
contracts with individual clients and resellers determine when receivables are due and payable 
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  the unpaid receivables are reviewed monthly to determine the payment status based upon the most currently available information as to the status of the receivables 
during these monthly reviews  the company determines the required allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the unwillingness or inability of its clients or resellers to make required payments 
capitalized software development costs software development costs are accounted for in accordance with asc software costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed 
costs associated with the planning and designing phase of software development are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
once technological feasibility has been determined  a portion of the costs incurred in development  including coding  testing  and quality assurance  are capitalized until available for general release to clients  and subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
amortization is calculated on a solution by solution basis and is over the estimated economic life of the software amortization for our legacy software systems is provided on a solution by solution basis over the estimated economic life of the software  using the straight line method 
amortization commences when a solution is available for general release to clients 
acquired internally developed software from the interpoint and meta acquisitions is amortized on the basis of undiscounted future cash flows 
unamortized capitalized costs determined to be in excess of the net realizable value of a solution are expensed at the date of such determination 
the company reviews  on an on going basis  the carrying value of its capitalized software development expenditures  net of accumulated amortization 
contractual obligations the company has various contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments including debt agreements and operating lease obligations 

index to financial statements the following table summarizes significant contractual obligations and commitments of the company as of january  except as set forth in the following table  the company does not have any material long term purchase obligations or other long term liabilities that are reflected on its balance sheet as of january  payments due by period less than year years years more than years total long term debt obligations contingent consideration for earn out interest expense on long term debt  including success fee operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the estimated interest expense payments on long term debt reflected in the table above are based on both the amount outstanding and the respective interest rates in effect as of january  the estimated contingent consideration for earn out principal payments  as reflected in the table above  are based on the assumption that the earn out liability will be paid in the form of a note in july  in accordance with payment terms as stipulated in the interpoint purchase agreement 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity is dependent upon numerous factors including i the timing and amount of revenues and collection of contractual amounts from clients  ii amounts invested in research and development  capital expenditures  and iii the level of operating expenses  all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company s primary cash requirements include regular payment of payroll and other business expenses  interest payments on debt  and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures generally include computer hardware and computer software to support internal development efforts or infrastructure in the saas data center 
operations are funded by cash generated by operations and borrowings under credit facilities 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and available credit facilities are adequate to fund current obligations for the next twelve months 
cash balances at january  and were  and  respectively
