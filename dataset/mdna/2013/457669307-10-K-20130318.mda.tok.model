item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion also should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview insmed is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing inhaled therapies for patients battling serious lung diseases that are often life threatening 
our lead product candidate  arikace or liposomal amikacin for inhalation  is an inhaled antibiotic treatment that delivers a proven and potent anti infective directly to the site of serious lung infections to improve the efficacy  safety and convenience of this therapeutic approach for patients 
currently  we are conducting clinical trials for two initial indications for this product in orphan patient populations a phase clinical trial in cf patients who have lung infections caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa pseudomonas and a phase clinical trial in patients who have lung infections caused by non tuberculous mycobacteria ntm 
our strategy is to continue to develop arikace for additional indications beyond pseudomonas in cf and ntm 
our primary development focus is to obtain regulatory approval for arikace for these two initial indications and to prepare for commercialization initially in europe and canada and eventually in the us 
if approved  arikace will be the first once a day inhaled antibiotic treatment option available for these cf and ntm indications 
we were incorporated in the commonwealth of virginia on november  on december   we completed a business combination with transave  inc a privately held  new jersey based pharmaceutical company focused on the development of differentiated and innovative inhaled pharmaceuticals for the site specific treatment of serious lung infections 
our continuing operations are based on the technology and products historically developed by transave 
our principal executive offices are located at deer park drive  suite c  monmouth junction  new jersey and our phone number is our internet address is www

on march   we completed a one for ten reverse stock split of our common stock 
unless otherwise noted  the per share amounts in this annual report on form k give retroactive effect to the reverse stock split for all periods presented 
key components of our statement of operations revenues we did not recognize any revenue in  and currently do not recognize any revenue from product sales or other sources 
our revenues in and consisted of cost recovery revenues from the use of iplex in an expanded access program eap we established in italy to provide iplex to physicians for use in their patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als this program was discontinued in december  and an upfront license payment received from eleison pharmaceuticals  inc eleison for the licensing of our lipid complexed cisplatin and or liposomal cisplatin products and technology to eleison 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our research and development functions  and other internal operating expenses  the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate for clinical study  the cost of conducting clinical studies  and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities 
our expenses related to manufacturing our drug candidate for clinical study are primarily related to activities at contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture arikace for our use 
our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts primarily depend mainly on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time based fees 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided 

index prior to  we devoted substantially all of our resources to the research and development of a number of product candidates in our follow on biologics fob platform and advancing our proprietary protein platform into niche markets with unmet needs 
since  we have focused our development activities principally on our proprietary  advanced liposomal technology designed specifically for inhalation lung delivery 
we are conducting three clinical trials a phase trial in europe and canada in which we are evaluating arikace in cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections  an open label extension study in which patients that complete the phase trial have the option to receive arikace for a period of two years and a phase trial in the us in which we are evaluating arikace for ntm infections 
since our business combination with transave  our research and development expenses for our arikace program were approximately million 
we expect that our development efforts in and will principally relate to the use of arikace in the cf and ntm indications 
our clinical trials with arikace are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that are outside of our control  including the possibility that necessary regulatory approvals may not be obtained 
in addition  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly from trial to trial over the life of a project as a result of differences in the study protocol for each trial as well as differences arising during the clinical trial  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that is determined to be appropriate in view of results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may be subject to delays  particularly if we are unable to produce clinical trial material in sufficient quantities and of sufficient quality to meet the schedule for our clinical trials 
moreover  all of our product candidates must overcome significant regulatory  technological  manufacturing and marketing challenges before they can be successfully commercialized 
any significant delays that occur or additional expenses that we incur may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and may require us to raise additional capital sooner or in larger amounts than is presently expected 
in addition  as a result of the risks and uncertainties related to the development and approval of our product candidates and the additional uncertainties related to our ability to market and sell these products once approved for commercial sale  we are unable to provide a meaningful prediction regarding when  if at all  we will generate positive cash inflow from these projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving in our executive  finance and accounting  legal  market research  and human resource functions 
general and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal  including patent related expenses  consulting  insurance  board of director fees  tax and accounting services 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in order to support increased levels of development activities and commencement of commercialization activities for our product candidates 
impairment loss impairment loss consists of the write down of the carrying amounts of in process research and development ipr d and goodwill intangible assets 
we use the multi period excess earnings method mpeem for calculating impairment loss  which is a form of the income approach to derive the fair value of ipr d intangible and goodwill assets 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we decided that a market based valuation approach was not appropriate for our financial reporting because we do not have operating revenues or net income 
the income approach requires significant management judgment with respect to future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in our working capital  appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates 
we believe the estimates and assumptions used in assessing impairment loss are consistent with our business plans 
the use of different estimates and assumptions would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our ipr d  and might result in different effects on our results of operations 
our actual results of operations may differ from management estimates used in assessing impairment loss 

index debt issuance costs debt issuance costs are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the debt 
our balance sheet reflects debt net of debt issuance costs paid to the lender and reflects debt issuance costs paid to other third parties as other assets 
investment income and interest expense investment income consists of interest and dividend income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with realized gains losses on the sale of investments 
interest expense consists primarily of interest costs related to our debt and capital lease obligations 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per common share basic and diluted compared with a net loss of million or per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  the net loss attributable to stockholders in includes approximately million in severance costs related to the termination of certain executives and employees 
the net loss attributable to common stockholders in includes a million non cash impairment loss for the write down of the carrying amounts our ipr d and goodwill intangible assets  a million non cash charge for the beneficial conversion feature of our previously outstanding series b preferred stock issued in the transave merger and approximately million in expenses relating to our decision to discontinue use of our richmond  virginia facility 
revenue we did not recognize any revenue for the year ended december  our revenues in consisted of million of cost recovery revenues from the use of iplex in an expanded access program eap we established in italy to provide iplex to physicians for use in their patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and a million non refundable upfront license payment received from eleison pharmaceuticals  inc for the licensing of our liposomal cisplatin products and technology 
we recorded this revenue during as we had the contractual right to receive it and we have no continuing involvement under this licensing agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december  and  comprised the following year ended december  increase decrease in thousands clinical development clinical manufacturing regulatory and quality assurance compensation and related research and development expenses increased to million in from million in despite an increase in clinical trial activity in  our overall clinical development expenses decreased by million 
this decrease was primarily attributable to study start up expenses incurred in related to the arikace phase clinical trial in a us cf patient population and the costs incurred to establish and initiate our phase cf clinical trial in europe and canada 
the clinical development costs include clinical trial expenses and enrollment milestones for our phase cf clinical study in europe and canada  the open label cf extension study  as well as our phase ntm clinical study in the us 
clinical manufacturing expenses increased by million from to as we produced a greater number of arikace lots for use in our studies 
the decrease in regulatory and quality assurance expenses of million in the year ended compared with was attributable to the regulatory planning associated with the clinical studies noted above 
the million increase in compensation and related expenses is attributable to increases in employee separation costs  including severance and related benefits  and facilities costs 

index general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the results included approximately million in severance expenses related to the departure of several executives and employees 
the results included million in charges related to our decision to discontinue use of our richmond  virginia facility 
in addition  total professional fees decreased by million from to as a result of lower legal fees 
impairment loss we recorded a million non cash impairment loss in due to the decline in the fair value of our in process research and development  or ipr d intangible and goodwill assets 
this decline in fair value resulted from the impact of the clinical hold placed on our phase studies of arikace by the fda in august in january  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in patients with ntm lung infections  and in may  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in the us for the treatment of cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections 
investment income investment income decreased to million in from million in the million decrease is a result of diminishing rates of return on our short term investments during compared to interest expense interest expense increased to million during compared to million in the million increase was due to million of borrowings million in june and million in december under our loan and security agreement we entered into in june accretion of beneficial conversion feature during march  our stockholders approved a proposal to convert all of our outstanding series b preferred stock into common stock 
in connection with this approval  we recorded a million non cash charge in for the beneficial conversion feature of our previously outstanding series b preferred stock 
the charge resulted from the difference between the conversion price of the series b preferred stock of per share and its carrying value of per share 
the carrying value of the series b preferred stock was based on its fair value at issuance  which was estimated using the common stock price reduced for a lack of marketability between the issuance date and the anticipated date of conversion 
comparison of years ended december  and net loss attributable to common stockholders for the year ended december  was million or per common share basic and diluted compared with a net loss of million or per common share basic and diluted for the year ended december  the net loss attributable to common stockholders in included a million non cash charge related to the impairment of our in process research and development and a million non cash charge for the beneficial conversion feature of our previously outstanding series b preferred stock 
revenue for the year ended december   revenues totaled million  as compared with million for the year ended december  the million reduction was primarily due to a year over year decrease of million in cost recovery revenue from our iplex eap in europe  offset by million in license fees from the licensing of patent technology related to our cisplatin lipid complex 
our iplex eap was discontinued in 
index research and development expenses research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase of million in is primarily attributable to the development of arikace and the manufacturing of product to support clinical studies 
clinical development expenses increased by million in as compared with as a result of study initiation and start up fees for arikace plus the expenses for a preclinical toxicology study associated with the arikace development program 
in addition  a million increase in clinical manufacturing expenses from to was attributable to the manufacturing of arikace for use in our studies 
we also incurred greater compensation and related expenses of million as a result of increased headcount associated with the development of arikace 
in fact  overall research and development headcount increased from approximately as of december  to as of december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase was due primarily to a million charge in the fourth quarter of resulting from the closure of our richmond  virginia facility 
impairment loss in we recorded a million non cash impairment loss resulting from the decline in the fair value of our ipr d intangible and goodwill assets  due to the material impact of the temporary clinical hold on our arikace development program 
in january  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in patients with ntm lung infections 
in may  the fda lifted the clinical hold on arikace in the us for the treatment of cf patients with pseudomonas lung infections 
investment income and interest expense investment income  net of interest expense  increased to million in from million in the million increase is a result of improved returns on our short term investments despite a decrease in overall short term investment balances year over year 
the reduction in interest expense in compared with was entirely due to the elimination of convertible notes  which were fully repaid in march accretion of beneficial conversion feature in  we recorded a million non cash charge for the beneficial conversion feature of our then outstanding series b preferred stock 
the charge resulted from the difference between the conversion price of the series b preferred stock of per share and its carrying value of per share 
the carrying value of the series b preferred stock was based on its fair value at issuance  which was estimated using the common stock price reduced for a lack of marketability between the issuance date and the anticipated date of conversion 
liquidity and capital resources overview there is considerable time and cost associated with developing a potential drug or pharmaceutical product to the point of regulatory approval and commercialization 
historically  we have funded our operations through public and private placements of equity securities  through debt financing  from the proceeds from the sale of our follow on biologics fob platform to merck in and from revenues related to sales of product and our iplex eap  which was discontinued in we expect to continue to incur losses because we plan to fund research and development activities and commercial launch activities  and we do not expect material revenues for at least the next few years 

index as of december   we had total cash  cash equivalents  and a certificate of deposit on hand of million  consisting of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in a certificate of deposit  as compared with million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and a certificate of deposit on hand as of december   an increase of million 
the million net increase was due to our financing activities during  which included million of proceeds from our debt financing and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  which were partially offset by the use of million in operations 
our working capital was million as of december   which excludes our certificate of deposit of million that matures in july we believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for however  our business strategy may require us to  or we may otherwise determine to  raise additional capital at any time through equity or debt financing s  strategic transactions or otherwise 
such additional funding may be necessary to continue to develop our potential product candidates  to pursue the license or purchase of complementary technologies  to commercialize our product candidates or to purchase other products 
in addition  we may determine to raise capital opportunistically 
we cannot assure you that adequate capital will be available on favorable terms  or at all  when needed 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds when required  we may be forced to delay  restrict or eliminate all or a portion of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in operating activities during and was primarily for the clinical development of our lead product candidate  arikace  which included the advancement of arikace in three clinical trials 
the million increase in net cash used in operating activities in as compared to related primarily to the initiation of two clinical trials for the study of arikace 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of the net sales of short term investments of million 
the net cash provided by investing activities in resulted from million of net sales of short term investments that were partially offset by fixed asset purchases of million that were primarily for leasehold improvements 
the net cash provided by investing activities in was primarily a result of million of net sales of short term investments that were partially offset by million of cash consideration paid to stockholders as a result of our merger with transave 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock registered in a direct public offering 
net cash used in financing activities in was primarily a result of payments on capital lease obligations 
net cash used in financing activities in was due to the final repayment of the convertible notes 
on june   we and our domestic subsidiaries  as co borrowers  entered into a loan and security agreement that allowed us to borrow up million in million increments loan agreement 
we borrowed the first and second million increments by signing two secured promissory notes notes a and b on june  and december   respectively 
notes a and b bear interest at 
note a is to be repaid over a month period with the first twelve monthly payments representing interest only followed by thirty monthly equal payments of principal and interest 
note b is to be repaid over a month period with the first six monthly payments representing interest only followed by thirty monthly equal payments of principal and interest 
the interest only period is extendable to december   contingent upon completion of certain arikace related development milestones 
the principal monthly repayments for notes a and b are scheduled to begin on august  and end on january  in connection with the loan agreement  we granted the lender a first position lien on all of our assets  excluding intellectual property 
prepayment of the loans made pursuant to the loan agreement is subject to penalty and we are required to pay an end of term charge of contractual obligations we have two operating leases for office and laboratory space located in monmouth junction  nj that terminate on december  future minimum rental payments under these two leases total approximately million 
we continue to lease office space in richmond  va where our corporate headquarters were previously located 
future minimum rental payments under this lease total approximately million 
during  we recorded a net present value charge of million in general and administrative expenses associated with vacating the richmond  va facility 

index we executed two secured promissory notes totaling million  million in june and million in december we also entered into three capital leases for lab equipment and leasehold improvements with monthly payments through december as of december   future payments under the two promissory notes  the capital leases and minimum future payments under non cancellable operating leases are as follows as of december  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital lease obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations this table does not include a any milestone payments which may become payable to third parties under our license and collaboration agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known  b any royalty payments to third parties as the amounts of such payments  timing and or the likelihood of such payments are not known  and c contracts that are entered into in the ordinary course of business which are not material in the aggregate in any period presented above 
we currently have a licensing agreement with pari for use of the optimized eflow nebulizer system for delivery of arikace in treating patients with cf  bronchiectasis and ntm infections 
we have rights to several us and foreign issued patents  and patent applications involving improvements to the optimized eflow nebulizer system 
under the licensing agreement  pari is entitled to receive payments either in cash  qualified stock or a combination of both  at pari s discretion  based on achievement of certain milestone events including phase trial initiation which occurred in  first acceptance of maa submission or equivalent in the us of arikace and the device  first receipt of marketing approval in the us for arikace and the device  and first receipt of marketing approval in a major eu country for arikace and the device  and nda acceptance and regulatory approval of arikace 
in addition  pari is entitled to receive royalty payments on commercial sales of arikace pursuant to the licensing agreement 
in and  we entered into a research funding agreements with cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics  inc cfft whereby we received million and million for each respective agreement in research funding for the development of its arikace product 
if arikace becomes an approved product for cf patients in the us  we will owe a payment to cfft of up to million that is payable over a three year period after approval as a commercialized drug in the us 
furthermore  if certain sales milestones are met within years of the drug commercialization approval in the us  we would owe an additional million in additional payments 
since there is significant development risk associated with arikace  we have not accrued these obligations 
in and  we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement crada with national institutes of allergy and infectious diseases niaid to design and conduct our phase study of arikace in patients with ntm 
niaid has also agreed to provide biostatistical advisory input in connection with the phase ntm study 
if we decide not to continue with the commercialization of arikace in ntm  niaid will have the right to complete the clinical trial 
further niaid may elect to pursue its rights to obtain license rights to certain inventions made under the crada 

index future funding requirements we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and to develop and commercialize arikace 
our future capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors  including the decisions of the fda and ema with respect to our applications for marketing approval of arikace in the us and europe  the costs of activities related to the regulatory approval process  and the timing of approvals  if received  the timing and cost of our anticipated clinical trials of arikace for the treatment of adult patients with cf  the cost of putting in place the sales and marketing capabilities necessary to be prepared for a potential commercial launch of arikace  if approved  the cost of filing  prosecuting and enforcing patent claims  the costs of our manufacturing related activities  the costs associated with commercializing arikace if we receive marketing approval  and subject to receipt of marketing approval  the levels  timing and collection of revenue received from sales of approved products  if any  in the future 
in june  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration statement permits us to offer  from time to time  any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants of up to an aggregate of million 
in october  we issued approximately million worth of common stock utilizing the shelf registration statement 
we believe we currently have sufficient funds to meet our financial needs for however  our business strategy may require us to  or we may otherwise determine to  raise additional capital at any time through equity or debt financing s  strategic transactions or otherwise 
such additional funding may be necessary to continue to develop our potential product candidates  to pursue the license or purchase of complementary technologies  to commercialize our product candidates or to purchase other products 
in addition  we may determine to raise capital opportunistically 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and commercialization or our plans to establish a sales and marketing force  any of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon equity and debt market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  our continued progress in our regulatory  development and commercial activities 
we cannot assure you that such capital funding will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient additional funds when required  we may be forced to delay  restrict or eliminate all or a portion of our research or development programs  dispose of assets or technology or cease operations 
to date  we have not generated any revenue from arikace 
we do not know when or if we will generate any revenue 
we do not expect to generate significant revenue unless or until we obtain marketing approval of  and commercialize  arikace 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we do not have any interest in special purpose entities  structured finance entities or other variable interest entities 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we use our historical experience and other relevant factors when developing our estimates and assumptions 
we continually evaluate these estimates and assumptions 
the amounts of assets and liabilities reported in our consolidated balance sheets and the amounts of revenue reported in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss are effected by estimates and assumptions  which are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for research and development  revenue recognition  beneficial conversion charge  stock based compensation  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill  and accrued expenses 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
for additional accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 

index research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and other related costs  including stock based compensation  for personnel serving our research and development functions  and other internal operating expenses  the cost of manufacturing our drug candidate for clinical study  the cost of conducting clinical studies  and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities 
our expenses related to manufacturing our drug candidate for clinical study are primarily related to activities at contract manufacturing organizations that manufacture arikace for our use 
our expenses related to clinical trials are primarily related to activities at contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
these contracts set forth the scope of work to be completed at a fixed fee or amount per patient enrolled 
payments under these contracts primarily depend mainly on performance criteria such as the successful enrollment of patients or the completion of clinical trial milestones as well as time based fees 
expenses are accrued based on contracted amounts applied to the level of patient enrollment and to activity according to the clinical trial protocol 
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the services are performed  or when the goods or services are no longer expected to be provided 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when all of the following four criteria are present persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
where we have continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement  non refundable upfront license payments received upon contract signing are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as the related activities are performed 
the period over which these activities are to be performed is based upon management s estimate of the development period 
changes in management s estimate could change the period over which revenue is recognized 
research and or development payments are recognized as revenues as the related research and or development activities are performed and when we have no continuing performance obligations related to the research and development payment received 
where we have no continuing involvement under a collaborative arrangement  we record nonrefundable license fee revenues when we have the contractual right to receive the payment  in accordance with the terms of the collaboration agreement  and record milestones upon appropriate notification to us of achievement of the milestones by the collaborative partner 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments when earned  provided that i the milestone event is substantive and its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and ii we do not have ongoing performance obligations related to the achievement of the milestone earned 
milestone payments are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payment a is commensurate with either the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item or items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the vendor s performance to achieve the milestone  b relates solely to past performance  and c is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms including other potential milestone consideration within the arrangement 
any amounts received under the agreement in advance of performance  if deemed substantive  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
with regard to recognizing revenue for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  each deliverable within a multiple deliverable revenue arrangement is accounted for as a separate unit of accounting if both of the following criteria are met the delivered item or items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
in addition  multiple deliverable revenue arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we also apply a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which includes vendor specific objective evidence  if available  third party evidence  if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  and estimated selling price if neither vendor specific nor third party evidence is available 

index deferred revenue associated with a non refundable payment received under a collaborative agreement that is terminated prior to its completion results in an immediate recognition of the deferred revenue 
beneficial conversion charge when issuing debt or equity securities that are convertible into our common stock at a discount from the fair value of our common stock at the date the debt or equity financing is committed  we are required to record a beneficial conversion charge in accordance with accounting standards codification on the commitment date the conversion date 
the beneficial conversion charge is measured as the difference between the fair value of the securities at the time of issue and the fair value of the common stock at the commitment date 
we record the beneficial conversion charge as a non cash charge to earnings 
in  we recorded a beneficial conversion charge of million for the conversion of our previously outstanding series b preferred stock issued in the transave merger into common stock 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further information about the beneficial conversion feature 
stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees and directors based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the grant date fair value of the award is recognized as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period  which generally equals the vesting period of the award  and if applicable  is adjusted for expected forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense is included in both research and development expenses and general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss 
for awards deemed to be granted outside of the company s stock incentive plan  the company uses liability accounting 
these awards are classified as a liability and are remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period 
changes in fair value are included in compensation expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss see additional disclosures related to awards granted outside of the stock incentive plan in footnote stock based compensation of our consolidated financial statements located in part iv  item of this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes the assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted during the years ended december  and no stock options were granted during 
volatility risk free interest rate dividend yield expected option term in years for the years ended december  and  the volatility factor was based on our historical volatility since the closing of our merger with transave  inc on december  the expected life was determined using the simplified method as described in asc topic  accounting for stock compensation  which is the midpoint between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the date of grant 
forfeitures are based on actual percentage of option forfeitures since the closing of the merger on december  and are the basis for future forfeiture expectations 
identifiable intangible assets and goodwill identifiable intangible assets are measured at their respective fair values and are not amortized until commercialization 
once commercialization occurs  these intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the fair values assigned to our intangible assets are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given available facts and circumstances 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur that may require us to review the assets for impairment 
events or circumstances that may require an impairment assessment include negative clinical trial results  the non approval of a new drug application by a regulatory agency  material delays in our development program or a sustained decline in market capitalization 

index indefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to periodic amortization 
rather  indefinite lived intangibles are reviewed for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
events or circumstances that may require an interim impairment assessment are consistent with those described above 
we perform our annual impairment test as of october of each year 
we use the income approach to derive the fair value of in process research and development assets 
this approach calculates fair value by estimating future cash flows attributable to the assets and then discounting these cash flows to a present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
a market based valuation approach was not considered given a lack of revenues and profits by us 
this approach requires significant management judgment with respect to unobservable inputs such as future volume  revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital use  appropriate discount rates and other assumptions and estimates 
the estimates and assumptions used are consistent with our business plans 
accrued expenses we are required to estimate accrued expenses as part of our process of preparing financial statements 
this process involves estimating the level of service performed on our behalf and the associated cost incurred in instances where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of areas in which subjective judgments may be required include costs associated with services provided by contract organizations for preclinical development  clinical trials and manufacturing of clinical materials 
we accrue for expenses associated with these external services by determining the total cost of a given study based on the terms of the related contract 
we accrue for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the trials and the invoices received from our external service providers 
in the case of clinical trials  the estimated cost normally relates to the projected costs of having subjects enrolled in our trials  which we recognize over the estimated term of the trial according to the number of subjects enrolled in the trial on an ongoing basis  beginning with subject enrollment 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accruals 
to date  the number of clinical trials and related research service agreements has been relatively limited and our estimates have not differed significantly from the actual costs incurred
