management overview quality systems  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries operate as four business divisions each  a division which are comprised of i the qsi dental division  ii the nextgen division  iii the hospital solutions division formerly inpatient solutions and iv the rcm services division formerly practice solutions 
in fiscal year  we opened a captive entity in india called quality systems india healthcare private limited qsih 
we primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing healthcare information systems that automate certain aspects of medical and dental practices  networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations phos and management service organizations msos  ambulatory care centers  community health centers and medical and dental schools along with comprehensive systems implementation  maintenance and support and add on complementary services such as revenue cycle management rcm and electronic data interchange edi 
our systems and services provide our clients with the ability to redesign patient care and other workflow processes while improving productivity through the facilitation of managed access to patient information 
utilizing our proprietary software in combination with third party hardware and software solutions  our products enable the integration of a variety of administrative and clinical information operations 
in the last few years  we have continued to acquire companies that were established developers of software and services for the inpatient market to operate under the hospital solutions division 
on may   we acquired poseidon  a provider of emergency department software 
on july   we acquired cqi  a provider of hospital systems for surgery management 
on april   we acquired intranexus  a provider of web based integrated clinical and hospital information systems 
on february   we acquired opus  a provider of web based clinical solutions to hospital systems and integrated health networks nationwide and on august  we acquired sphere  a provider of financial information systems to the small hospital inpatient market 
these acquisitions are part of our strategy to continue to expand in the small hospital market and to add new clients by taking advantage of cross selling opportunities between the ambulatory and inpatient markets 
on november   we acquired viatrack  a developer and provider of information technologies that enhance edi offerings 
this acquisition provides a platform to pursue significant opportunities that exist to add edi services to our portfolio of offerings in the inpatient market and is operating under the qsi dental division 
on april   we acquired matrix  a value added reseller for nextgen healthcare  that provides rcm services  healthcare it solutions and training  implementation and support centered on nextgen technology  to its clients nationwide 
the acquisition will enable our rcm services division to expand its footprint among private and hospital based physicians and groups by leveraging matrix rcm expertise 
in january  qsih was formed in bangalore  india to function as our india based captive to offshore technology application development and business processing services 
we have benefited and hope to continue to benefit from the increased demands on healthcare providers for greater efficiency and lower costs  financial incentives from the arra to physicians who adopt electronic health records  as well as increased adoption rates for electronic health records and other technology in the healthcare arena 
we also believe that healthcare reform and the movement towards pay for performance quality initiatives will also stimulate demand for robust electronic health record solutions as well as new hit solutions from bundled billing capabilities to patient engagement and population health management 
while we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records  the market for physician based electronic health records software is becoming increasingly saturated while physician group practices are rapidly being consolidated by hospital  insurance payers and other entities 
hospital software providers are leveraging their position with their hospital customers to gain market share with hospital owned physician practices 
insurance providers and large physician groups are also consolidating physician offices creating additional opportunity for ambulatory software providers such as nextgen 
our strategy is to focus addressing upcoming needs of accountable care organizations around interoperability  patient engagements  population health  and data analytics 
we believe that our core strength lies in the central role our software products and services play in the delivery of healthcare by the primary physician in an ambulatory setting 
we intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements including icd and meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments 
we believe that the expanded requirements for continued eligibility for incentive payments under meaningful use rules will result in an expanded replacement market for electronic health records software 
we intend to continue the development and enhancement of our software solutions to support healthcare reform and the 
table of contents transition from fee for service to pay for performance quality initiatives such as accountable care organizations 
key elements of our future software development will be to continue to integrate our ambulatory and inpatient products  making our products more intuitive and easy to use  and enhancing our ability to deliver our software over the cloud with the latest technology 
we also want to continue investments in our infrastructure including but not limited to product development  sales  marketing  implementation and support  to continue efforts to make infrastructure investments within an overall context of maintaining reasonable expense discipline  to add new clients through maintaining and expanding sales  marketing and product development activities and to expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of add on and complementary products and services while continuing our gold standard commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs 
we believe that our growing customer base that is using our software on a daily basis is a strategic asset  and we intend to expand our product and service offerings towards this customer base in order to leverage this strategic asset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  uncollectible accounts receivable  software development cost  intangible assets and self insurance accruals for reasonableness 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the significant accounting policies  as described in note of our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following table depicts the most critical accounting policies that affect our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition judgments and uncertainties we generate revenue from the sale of licensing rights to use our software products sold directly to end users and value added resellers  or vars 
we also generate revenue from sales of hardware and third party software  implementation  training  software customization  edi  post contract support maintenance and other services  including rcm and hosting services  performed for clients who license our products 
revenue from implementation and training services is recognized as the corresponding services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual maintenance period 
rcm revenue is derived from services fees  which include amounts charged for ongoing billing and other related services and are generally billed to the client as a percentage of total collections 
we do not recognize revenue for services fees until these collections are made as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time 
contract accounting is applied where services include significant software modification  development or customization 
a typical system contract contains multiple elements of the items discussed 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of those elements 
the fair value of an element is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
vsoe calculations are updated and reviewed quarterly or annually depending on the nature of the product or service 
the company generally establishes vsoe for the related undelivered elements based on the bell shaped curve method 
maintenance vsoe for the company largest clients is based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within the company customary pricing practices 
when evidence of fair value exists for the delivered and undelivered elements of a transaction  then discounts for individual elements are aggregated and the total discount is allocated to the individual elements in proportion to the elements fair value relative to the total contract fair value 
when evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements only  the residual method is used 
under the residual method  the company defers revenue related to the undelivered elements in a system sale based on vsoe of fair value of each of the undelivered elements and allocates the remainder of the contract price net of all discounts to revenue recognized from the delivered elements 
if vsoe of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist  all revenue is deferred until vsoe of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered 
provided the fees are fixed or determinable and collection is considered probable  revenue from licensing rights and sales of hardware and third party software is generally recognized upon physical or electronic shipment and transfer of title 
in certain transactions where collection risk is high  the revenue is deferred until collection occurs or becomes probable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each period subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method 
fees which are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the company arrangements must include the following characteristic 
table of contents the fee must be negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and generally be based on the specific volume of products to be delivered without being subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts judgments and uncertainties we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we perform credit evaluations of our clients and maintain reserves for estimated credit losses 
reserves for potential credit losses are determined by establishing both specific and general reserves 
specific reserves are based on management s estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts 
general reserves are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material 
software development costs judgments and uncertainties development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external use are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after technological feasibility is established  any additional external software development costs are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the related product  which is typically three years 
we periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of such capitalized software costs 
if a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated cash flows to be generated from the applicable software  any remaining capitalized amounts are written off 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material 
goodwill judgments and uncertainties the company tests goodwill for impairment annually during its first fiscal quarter  referred to as the annual test date 
the company will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level  which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions 
table of contents in fiscal we adopted the new provisions issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  that intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
the updated guidance permits us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we conduct a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill 
the amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  if any  is recognized as an impairment loss 
during the quarter ended december  and subsequently at march   certain events and circumstances indicated the possibility that the carrying value of goodwill could potentially be impaired 
refer to the impairment of goodwill section within the comparison of the fiscal years ended march  and march  discussion below for information regarding the impairment of goodwill at march  we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material 
business combinations purchase price allocations judgments and uncertainties during the last three fiscal years  we completed five acquisitions poseidon  matrix  viatrack  cqi and intranexus 
in accordance with the accounting for business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values 
our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices  the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
intangible assets judgments and uncertainties intangible assets consist of trade names and contracts  customer relationships  and software technology  all is which arose in connection with the acquisitions completed during the last three fiscal years 
these intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization 
the company currently amortizes the intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable  actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets  resulting in impairment charges that could be material 
we test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
share based compensation judgments and uncertainties 
table of contents our stock based compensation plans consist of stock options and restricted stock 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our stock based compensation programs 
the company estimates the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
expected term is estimated using historical exercise experience 
volatility is estimated by using the weighted average historical volatility of the company s common stock  which approximates expected volatility 
the risk free rate is the implied yield available on the u 
s treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term 
the expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option 
those inputs are then entered into the black scholes model to determine the estimated fair value 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in the company s consolidated statements of income 
on may   the board of directors approved its fiscal year equity incentive program for certain employees to be awarded options to purchase the company common stock 
under the program  executives are eligible to receive options based on meeting certain target increases in eps performance and revenue and operating growth during fiscal year non executive employees are also eligible to receive options based on satisfying certain management established criteria and recommendations of senior management 
the options shall be issued pursuant to one of the company shareholder approved option plans  have an exercise price equal to the closing price of the company shares on the date of grant  a term of eight years and vesting in five equal annual installments commencing one year following the date of grant 
compensation expense associated with the performance based awards under the company s incentive plan are initially based on the number of options expected to vest after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met 
cumulative adjustments are recorded quarterly to reflect subsequent changes in the estimated outcome of performance related conditions 
share based compensation continued effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
self insured liabilities judgments and uncertainties effective january   we became self insured with respect to healthcare claims  subject to stop loss limits 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported as of each balance sheet date 
however  it is possible that recorded accruals may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims 
adjustments  if any  to estimated accruals resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in earnings during the periods in which such adjustments are determined 
our self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our self insured liabilities 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
overview of our results consolidated revenue increased in the year ended march   as compared to the prior year period 
revenue was positively impacted by growth in all of our service revenue categories  which in total grew 
the increase in consolidated revenue  however  was largely offset by a decline in system sales revenue 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the year ended march   as compared to in the prior year period 
the decline in gross profit as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to a change in revenue mix away from higher margin software license revenue toward lower margin service revenue 
software license revenue represented of total revenue compared to in the prior year 
accordingly  total gross profit from system sales declined to million versus million in the prior year 
partially offsetting the decline in system sales gross profit  however  was an increase in gross profit from service revenue  including maintenance  revenue cycle management and edi  which grew to million compared to million in the prior year 
consolidated operating income decreased in the year ended march   as compared to the prior year period primarily due to the following factors a a change in the mix of revenue towards lower margin service revenue resulting in a decline in gross profit  b higher selling  general and administrative expenses  which was primarily a result of increased headcount and selling related expenses 
table of contents at the nextgen division and c higher corporate related expenses  primarily due to the impairment of goodwill relating to the hospital solutions division 
qsi dental division qsi dental division revenue increased in the year ended march   and divisional operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses decreased  as compared to the same prior year period 
the decline in operating income is the result of a decrease in system sales and higher selling  general and administrative expenses 
it should be noted that the qsi dental division new software solution qsidental web is being sold as a saas solution  which typically spreads revenue over a longer period of time rather than being recognized upfront 
revenue recognized from qsidental web was not significant in the year ended march  the qsi dental division is well positioned to sell to the fqhcs market and intends to continue leveraging the nextgen division sales force to sell its dental electronic medical records software to practices that provide both medical and dental services  such as fqhcs  which are receiving grants as part of the arra 
our goal for the qsi dental division is to maximize profit performance given the constraints represented by a relatively weak purchasing environment in the dental group practice market while taking advantage of opportunities with the new qsidental web product 
nextgen division nextgen division revenue increased in the year ended march   as compared to the prior year period 
nextgen revenue was positively impacted by growth in service revenue  largely offset by a decline in system sales revenue 
recurring revenue  which consists of maintenance and edi revenue  increased to million and accounted for of total nextgen division revenue for the year ended march  in the same period a year ago  recurring revenue of million represented of total nextgen division revenue 
nextgen division operating income excluding unallocated corporate expenses decreased in the year ended march   as compared to the prior year period 
the decline in operating income is primarily the result of a decrease in system sales as mentioned above  as well as a increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in the current period 
our goals include taking maximum advantage of benefits related to the arra and continuing to further enhance our existing products  including continued efforts to maintain our status as a qualified vendor under the arra  expanding our software and service offerings supporting pay for performance initiatives around accountable care organizations  bringing greater ease of use and intuitiveness to our software products  expanding our interoperability capabilities  integrating our inpatient and ambulatory software products and further development and enhancements of our portfolio of specialty focused templates within our ehr software 
we intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements  including icd and meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments 
we believe that the expanded requirements for continued eligibility for incentive payments under meaningful use rules will result in an expanded replacement market for electronic health records software 
we also intend to continue selling additional software and services to existing clients  expanding penetration of connectivity and other services to new and existing clients  and capitalizing on growth and cross selling opportunities within the rcm services division and the hospital solutions division 
the nextgen division s growth is attributed to a strong brand name and reputation within a growing marketplace for electronic health records and investments in sales and marketing activities  including new marketing campaigns  trade show attendance and other expanded advertising and marketing expenditures 
we have also recently expanded our relationship with certain value added resellers with significant resources both domestically and internationally 
hospital solutions division hospital solutions division revenue decreased in the year ended march   as compared to the prior year period 
revenue was negatively impacted by a decline in system sales  as well as slightly lower maintenance revenue and higher reserves for sales returns 
divisional operating income loss excluding unallocated corporate expenses was a loss of million  as compared to income of million for the prior year period 
operating income was negatively impacted by increases in implementation and support costs related to expanding infrastructure to support a growing customer base  lower software revenue and an increase in selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses during the period  which grew million and million  respectively 
our acquisition of poseidon in may did not significantly impact the hospital solutions division results for the period 
the hospital solutions division has benefited from being able to offer both financial and cchit certified clinical software  which has been packaged together  and in may  the division nextgen inpatient clinicals software was certified for stage two of meaningful use 
the hospital solutions division has also benefited from cross sell opportunities with existing nextgen division customers  including hospitals that are owned or affiliated with physician offices 

table of contents the hospital solutions division has incurred losses in the last several quarters and is expected to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future while we continue to invest in implementation and training  support  and development to support our growing customer base and maximize customer satisfaction 
we continue to believe in the long term opportunity in the small hospital market in spite of the recent losses which we have incurred 
rcm services division rcm services division revenue increased in the year ended march  our acquisition of matrix in april added approximately million in revenue for the current period 
additionally  the rcm services division benefited from organic growth achieved through cross selling rcm services to existing nextgen division clients  as well as new clients added during the year ended march  operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to approximately of revenue in the year ended march  versus of revenue in the same prior year period primarily as a result of a significant increase in the rcm services division revenue compared to the prior year period  partially offset by higher selling  general and administrative expenses during the current period 
the company believes that a significant opportunity exists to cross sell revenue cycle management services to existing nextgen division customers 
the portion of existing nextgen division customers who are using the rcm services division rcm services is less than 
we also believe that the increased complexity related to the billing and collections process  which goes into effect with icd in october of  will create additional opportunities for our rcm services division 
there is also a significant opportunity to expand the rcm services division services into the hospital solution and dental division customers as well 
management is actively pursuing efforts to achieve faster growth from expanded efforts to leverage the existing nextgen division sales force towards selling revenue cycle management services 
actual and expected customer turnover may result in a near term decline in revenues for the division 
however  we are encouraged by increased sales activity and a growing sales pipeline of rcm services 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of net revenue represented by each item in our consolidated statements of income certain percentages below may not sum due to rounding

our net income for the year ended march  was million  or per share on both a basic and fully diluted basis 
in comparison  we earned million  or per share on a basic and per share on a fully diluted basis for the year ended march  the change in net income for the year ended march  was primarily attributed to the following a decrease in consolidated system sales gross profit as a result of reduced software revenue  an increase in recurring revenue based gross profit  including maintenance  rcm and edi which grew  and  respectively  compared to the prior year period  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses and amortization of acquired intangibles  a million impairment of goodwill relating to the hospital solutions division  and a decrease in the provision for income taxes primarily due to the extension of the research and development tax credit in the current year  as well as lower taxable income in comparison to the prior year period 
table of contents revenue 
revenue for the year ended march  increased to million from million for the year ended march  nextgen division revenue increased to million from million in the year ended march   qsi dental division revenue increased to million from million  and the rcm services division revenue increased to million from million 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in revenue for the hospital solutions division  which decreased to million from million in the same prior year period 
system sales 
revenue earned from company wide sales of systems for the year ended march  decreased to million from million in the prior year period 
our decrease in revenue from sales of systems was principally the result of a decrease in category revenue at our nextgen division and a decrease at our hospital solutions division 
nextgen division sales in this category decreased million to million during the year ended march  from million during the same prior year period while the hospital solutions division delivered a million decrease in category revenue to million in the year ended march  as compared to million in the same prior year period 
the decrease in system sales was driven primarily by lower sales of software to both new and existing clients  partially offset by increased implementation revenue at both the nextgen and hospital solutions divisions 
implementation revenue is typically earned and recognized in the quarters following the sale of the software 
implementation revenue grew for the year ended march  as the company was implementing system sales from prior periods 
accordingly  implementation revenue grew in fiscal despite the decline in system sales 
the following table breaks down our reported system sales into software  hardware and third party software  and implementation and training services components on a consolidated and divisional basis for the years ended march  and in thousands software hardware  third party software implementation and training services total system sales fiscal year ended march  qsi dental division nextgen division hospital solutions division rcm services division consolidated fiscal year ended march  qsi dental division nextgen division hospital solutions division rcm services division consolidated nextgen division software license revenue decreased in the year ended march  versus the same period last year 
the division software revenue accounted for of divisional system sales revenue during the year ended march  compared to during the same period a year ago 
software license revenue continues to be an area of primary emphasis for the nextgen division 
our decline in software revenue was related to a number of factors including higher adoption rates by large physician groups which resulted in a smaller number of new opportunities  the consolidation of physician offices by hospitals and other large enterprises thereby reducing the number of potential opportunities  and an extension to the deadline to adopt stage two meaningful use requirements until calendar we believe there are other trends which may positively impact future systems sales 
many of our existing large enterprise customers have plans to grow which will create future revenue opportunities as these customers purchase additional software and services to support their growth plans 
we also expect to benefit from the growth of a replacement market driven by an expected consolidation of ehr vendors 
finally  we believe many new opportunities will be created by the evolution of healthcare from a pay for services reimbursement model to a pay for performance model around the management of patient populations 
we are developing new products around these new opportunities which are expected to help drive future growth 
it is difficult to assess the relative impact as well as the timing of positive and negative trends  however  we believe the company is well positioned to support the ever increasing need for healthcare information technology 
during the year ended march   of the nextgen division system sales revenue was represented by hardware and third party software compared to during the same period a year ago 
the number of clients who purchase hardware and third party software and the dollar amount of hardware and third party software revenue fluctuates each period depending on the needs of clients 
the inclusion of hardware and third party software in the nextgen division sales arrangements is typically at the request of our clients 
implementation and training revenue related to system sales at the nextgen division increased in the year ended march  compared to the same prior year period 
implementation and training revenue related to system sales at the hospital solutions division increased  in the year ended march  as compared to the same prior year period 
the amount of implementation and training services revenue is dependent on several factors  including timing of client implementations  the availability of qualified staff and the mix of services being rendered 
the number of implementation and training staff increased during the year ended march  versus the same 
table of contents prior year period in order to accommodate the increased amount of implementation services sold in conjunction with software sales 
it should be noted however that we have experienced a decline in the level of systems sales in recent quarters which in turn have resulted in a decline in the amount of implementation services sold  specifically in the nextgen division 
we intend to address the fluctuation in demand for services by managing the use of third parties for implementation services 
we have historically relied on third parties for a portion of our implementations in order to manage customer requirements 
the hospital solutions division required a greater reliance on third parties to handle increased demands for implementation services  especially in the first half of the fiscal year ended march  maintenance  edi  rcm and other services 
for the year ended march   our company wide revenue from maintenance  edi  rcm and other services grew to million from million in the same prior year period 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in maintenance  edi and other services revenue from the nextgen division and an increase in rcm revenue from the rcm services division 
total nextgen division maintenance revenue for the year ended march  grew to million from million for the same prior year period while nextgen division edi revenue grew to million compared to million in the same prior year period

impairment of goodwill 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the operating performance of the hospital solutions division hospital reporting unit or hospital weakened  relative to the historic performance of this division 
revenues and operating results further declined during the third quarter of accordingly  we assessed the conditions giving rise to the operating performance and evaluated the carrying amount of hospital goodwill balance 
at such time  we concluded that the fair value of the hospital reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount of the related goodwill  and therefore the value of the goodwill required no impairment 
during the latter part of the quarter ended march   however  we reassessed the short term and longer term business strategies and operating expectations relating to the hospital solutions division 
from this assessment  we concluded that it was necessary to re evaluate hospital goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents based upon the above  the company performed step one of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of the hospital reporting unit  which was based on a combination of discounted cash flow analysis and market approach  was lower than the carrying value 
the failure of step one triggered step two of the impairment test 
as a result of the step two analysis  the company determined the implied fair value of the hospital reporting unit goodwill and concluded that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value 
based upon the resulting computations  an impairment charge of million was recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company determined the implied fair value of the hospital reporting unit goodwill in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
therefore  the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
key assumptions affecting the results of the goodwill impairment test include a the near term continuation of recent results of operations for the division and b our detailed reassessment of the strategies of the division and the actions required to achieve those strategies 
such reassessment resulted in a reprioritization of the objectives for the division in the next fiscal year and a determination that additional investment and expenditures would be required to achieve those objectives 
specifically  the division will place client satisfaction as its highest priority  de emphasizing near term growth 
to achieve high client satisfaction  the division plans to implement several initiatives designed to enhance the division ability to deliver better value for its customers including implementation  support  and software development 
first  the division will work to aggressively add employees to its implementation  support  and software development departments to increase the ratio of employees to customers 
this will enable the division to be more hands on and responsive during the implementation and support phases 
additionally  during the next fiscal year  the division plans to bear the cost of providing additional training and implementation services to certain customers  to enable those customers to make better use of the functionality of the system 
we believe that by completing this work and adding to the support  implementation  and development teams  the division will greatly improve its customer experience  and thereby help the division improve its ability to have more of its client base serve as reference sites 
additionally  the revenue assumptions relating to the hospital division outlook for the next several years reflect planned constraints on a the rate of new implementation engagements  to accommodate the client satisfaction initiative  and b the timing and extent of product sales in light of other operational and product development considerations 
though we have confidence in our assumptions regarding the future performance of the hospital solutions division  if the future financial results relating to the division fall short of our assumptions  the fair value of the reporting unit could be negatively impacted  resulting in an additional impairment of goodwill and or other intangible assets 
the company will continue to monitor the operating performance of its reporting units in future periods for evidence of any additional indicators of impairment
