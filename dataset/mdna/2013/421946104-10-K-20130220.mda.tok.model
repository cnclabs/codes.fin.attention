executive overview healthcare realty strategy is to own and operate healthcare properties  primarily medical office buildings and outpatient related facilities  that produce stable and growing rental income 
to execute its strategy of managing and growing its portfolio of healthcare properties  the company undertakes a broad spectrum of real estate activities including property management  leasing  acquisition  development  financing and disposition 
the company focuses on facilities located on or near the campuses of large  acute care hospitals and associated with leading health systems because management views these facilities as more stable and lower risk over time

table of contents discontinued operations as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  a company must present the results of operations of real estate assets disposed of or held for sale as discontinued operations 
therefore  the results of operations from such assets are classified as discontinued operations for the current period  and all prior periods presented are restated to conform to the current period presentation 
readers of the company s consolidated financial statements should be aware that each future disposal will result in a change to the presentation of the company s operations in the historical consolidated statements of operations as previously filed 
such reclassifications to the consolidated statements of operations will have no impact on previously reported net income attributable to common stockholders 
equity issuances on september   the company sold  shares of common stock at a gross price of per share net price of per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the company existing effective registration statement

the company sold no shares under this program in in january  the company sold  shares of common stock under this program for approximately million in net proceeds 
on february   the company terminated the sales agreements under this program  leaving no shares currently available for issuance 
other items impacting operations the company typically has higher general and administrative costs in the first quarter of every year as a result of employee benefit plan expenses  such as the expenses related to the grant of employee stock purchase plan options and healthcare savings accounts 
these items will likely increase general and administrative expenses by approximately million in the first quarter of non gaap measures management considers certain non gaap financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of the company operating performance 
a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
set forth below are descriptions of the non gaap financial measures management considers relevant to the company business and useful to investors  as well as reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
the non gaap financial measures presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as indicators of the company financial performance  or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as measures of the company liquidity  nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company needs 
management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the company consolidated historical operating results  these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated financial statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents same store net operating income noi and same store noi are non gaap financial measures of performance 
management considers same store noi an important supplemental measure because it allows investors  analysts and company management to measure unlevered property level operating results and compare those results to other real estate companies between periods on a consistent basis 
the company defines noi as operating revenues property operating revenue  single tenant net lease revenue  and rental lease guaranty income less property operating expenses related specifically to the property portfolio 
noi excludes straight line rent  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  gains and losses from property sales  property management fees and other revenues and expenses not specifically related to the property portfolio 
noi may also be adjusted for certain expenses that are related to prior periods or are not considered to be part of the operations of the properties

table of contents funds from operations funds from operations ffo and ffo per share are operating performance measures adopted by the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc nareit 
nareit defines ffo as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a reit s operating performance equal to net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management believes ffo and ffo per share to be supplemental measures of a reit s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non cash items  primarily depreciation and amortization expense 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
however  real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions 
the company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo and ffo per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods 
the company reports ffo and ffo per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the reit industry and by industry analysts to evaluate reits and because ffo per share is consistently reported  discussed  and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about reits 
for these reasons  management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss ffo and ffo per share 
however  ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the comparability of ffo for the year ended december  compared to was most significantly affected by the various property acquisitions during and and the results of operations of the portfolio from period to period  as well as the commencement of operations of properties that were previously under construction and continued leasing of the properties in stabilization 
other items that impacted the comparability of ffo are discussed below in results of operations

table of contents liquidity net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the company s cash flows are dependent upon rental rates on leases  occupancy levels of the multi tenanted buildings  acquisition and disposition activity during the year  and the level of operating expenses  among other factors 
the company expects to continue to meet its liquidity needs  including funding additional investments  paying dividends  repaying maturing debt and funding other debt service 
liquidity sources available include cash on hand  cash flows from operations  borrowings under the unsecured credit facility  proceeds from mortgage notes receivable repayments  proceeds from sales of real estate investments  or additional capital market financings  including the company s at the market equity offering program  or other debt or equity offerings 
the company also had unencumbered real estate assets with a cost of approximately billion as of december   which could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing 
the company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements 
the company cannot  however  be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs 
the company has some exposure to variable interest rates and its stock price has been impacted by the volatility in the stock markets 
however  the company s leases  which provide its main source of income and cash flow  have terms of approximately to years and have lease rates that generally increase on an annual basis at fixed rates or based on consumer price indices 
impact of inflation the company is subject to the risk of inflation as most of its revenues are derived from long term leases 
most of the company leases provide for fixed increases in base rents or increases based on the consumer price index and require the tenant to pay all or some portion of the increases in operating expenses 
the company believes that these provisions mitigate the impact of inflation 
however  there can be no assurances that the company ability to increase rents or recover operating expenses will always keep pace with inflation

table of contents application of critical accounting policies to accounting estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and the rules and regulations of the sec 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to exercise judgment and make assumptions that impact the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management routinely evaluates the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these regular evaluations consider historical experience and other reasonable factors and use the seasoned judgment of management personnel 
management has reviewed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
management believes the following paragraphs in this section describe the application of critical accounting policies by management to arrive at the critical accounting estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s accounting policies are more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  joint ventures  partnerships and variable interest entities vies where the company controls the operating activities 
all material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
management must make judgments regarding the company s level of influence or control over an entity and whether or not the company is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
consideration of various factors includes  but is not limited to  the company s ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  the company s form of ownership interest  the company s representation on the entity s governing body  the size and seniority of the company s investment  the company s ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions  the company s ability to replace the manager and or liquidate the entity 
management s ability to correctly assess its influence or control over an entity when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie affects the presentation of these entities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
if it is determined that the company is the primary beneficiary of a vie  the company s consolidated financial statements would include the operating results of the vie rather than the results of the variable interest in the vie 
the company would depend on the vie to provide timely financial information and would rely on the interest control of the vie to provide accurate financial information 
untimely or inaccurate financial information provided to the company or deficiencies in the vies internal controls over financial reporting could impact the company s consolidated financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting 
capitalization of costs gaap generally allows for the capitalization of various types of costs 
the rules and regulations on capitalizing costs and the subsequent depreciation or amortization of those costs versus expensing them in the period incurred vary depending on the type of costs and the reason for capitalizing the costs 
direct costs of a development project generally include construction costs  professional services such as architectural and legal costs  travel expenses  land acquisition costs as well as other types of fees and expenses 
these costs are capitalized as part of the basis of an asset to which such costs relate 
indirect costs include capitalized interest and overhead costs 
indirect costs are capitalized during construction and on the unoccupied space in a building for up to one year after the certificate of substantial completion is received 
capitalized interest is calculated using the weighted average interest rate of the company unsecured debt or the interest rate on project specific debt  if applicable 
the company continues to capitalize interest on the unoccupied portion of the properties in stabilization for up to one year after the buildings have been placed into service  at which time the capitalization of interest must cease 
the company s overhead costs are based on overhead load factors that are charged to a project based on direct time incurred 
the company computes the overhead load factors annually for its acquisition and development departments  which have employees who are involved in the projects 
the overhead load factors are computed to absorb that portion of indirect employee costs payroll and benefits  training  occupancy and similar costs that are attributable to the productive time the employee incurs working directly on projects 
the employees in the company s acquisitions and development departments who work on these projects maintain and report their hours daily  by project 
employee costs that are administrative  such as vacation time  sick time  or general and administrative time  are expensed in the period incurred 

table of contents acquisition related costs of an existing building include finder s fees  advisory  legal  accounting  valuation  other professional or consulting fees  and certain general and administrative costs 
these costs are also expensed in the period incurred 
management s judgment is also exercised in determining whether costs that have been previously capitalized to a project should be reserved for or written off if or when the project is abandoned or circumstances otherwise change that would call the project s viability into question 
the company follows a standard and consistently applied policy of classifying pursuit activity as well as reserving for these types of costs based on their classification 
the company classifies its pursuit projects into four categories  of which three relate to development and one relates to acquisitions 
the first category includes pursuits of developments that have a remote chance of producing new business 
costs for these projects are expensed in the period incurred 
the second category includes pursuits of developments that might reasonably be expected to produce new business opportunities although there can be no assurance that they will result in a new project or contract 
costs for these projects are capitalized but  due to the uncertainty of projects in this category  these costs are reserved at  which means that of the costs are expensed in the period incurred 
the third category includes those pursuits of developments that are either highly probable to result in a project or contract or already have resulted in a project or contract in which the contract requires the operator to reimburse the company s costs 
many times  these are pursuits involving operators with which the company is already doing business 
since the company believes it is probable that these pursuits will result in a project or contract  it capitalizes these costs in full and records no reserve 
the fourth category includes pursuits that involve the acquisition of existing buildings 
as discussed above  costs related to acquisitions of existing buildings are expensed in the period incurred 
each quarter  all capitalized pursuit costs are again reviewed carefully for viability or a change in classification  and a management decision is made as to whether any additional reserve is deemed necessary 
if necessary and considered appropriate  management would record an additional reserve at that time 
capitalized pursuit costs  net of the reserve  are carried in other assets in the company s consolidated balance sheets  and any reserve recorded is charged to general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
all pursuit costs will ultimately be written off to expense or capitalized as part of the constructed real estate asset 
as of december  and  the company had capitalized pursuit costs totaling million  net of reserve and million which were fully reserved  respectively 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill long lived assets held and used the company assesses the potential for impairment of identifiable intangible assets and long lived assets  primarily real estate properties  whenever events occur or a change in circumstances indicates that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
important factors that could cause management to review for impairment include significant underperformance of an asset relative to historical or expected operating results  significant changes in the company use of assets or the strategy for its overall business  plans to sell an asset before its depreciable life has ended  the expiration of a significant portion of leases in a property  or significant negative economic trends or negative industry trends for the company or its operators 
in addition  the company reviews for possible impairment those assets subject to purchase options and those impacted by casualties  such as hurricanes 
management remains continuously alert to the factors above  and others  that could indicate an impairment exists 
the company may  from time to time  be approached by a third party with interest in purchasing one or more of the company operating real estate properties that was otherwise not for sale 
alternatively  the company may explore disposing of an operating real estate property but without specific intent to sell the property and without the property meeting the criteria to be classified as held for sale see discussion below 
in such cases  the company and a potential buyer typically negotiate a letter of intent followed by a purchase and sale agreement that includes a due diligence time line for completion of customary due diligence procedures 
anytime throughout this period the transaction could be terminated by the parties 
the company views the execution of a purchase and sale agreement as a circumstance that warrants an impairment assessment and must include its best estimates of the impact of a potential sale in the recoverability test discussed in more detail below 
a property value is considered impaired only if management estimate of current and projected undiscounted and unleveraged operating cash flows of the property is less than the net carrying value of the property 
these estimates of future cash flows include only those that are directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the property based on its estimated remaining useful life 
these estimates  including the useful life determination which can be affected by any potential sale of the property  are based on management assumptions about its use of the property 
therefore  significant judgment is involved in estimating the current and projected cash flows 

table of contents when the company executes a purchase and sale agreement for a held and used property  the company performs the cash flow estimation described above 
this assessment gives consideration to all available information  including an assessment of the likelihood the potential transaction will be consummated under the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase and sale agreement 
management will re evaluate the recoverability of the property if and when significant changes occur as the transaction proceeds toward closing 
normally sale transactions will close within to days after the due diligence period expires 
upon expiration of the due diligence period  management will again re evaluate the recoverability of the property  updating its assessment based on the status of the potential sale 
whenever management determines that the carrying value of an asset that has been tested may not be recoverable  then an impairment charge would be recognized to the extent the current carrying value exceeds the current fair value of the asset 
significant judgment is also involved in making a determination of the estimated fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of by planned sale from time to time management affirmatively decides to sell certain real estate properties under a plan of sale 
the company reclassifies the property or disposal group as held for sale when all the following criteria for a qualifying plan of sale are met management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the property or disposal group  the property or disposal group is available for immediate sale ie  a seller currently has the intent and ability to transfer the property or disposal group to a buyer in its present condition  subject only to conditions that are usual and customary for sales of such properties or disposal groups  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell have been initiated  the sale of the property or disposal group is probable ie  likely to occur and the transfer is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year  with certain exceptions  the property or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value  and actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
a property or disposal group classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
an impairment charge is recognized for any initial adjustment of the property or disposal group carrying amount to its fair value less estimated costs to sell in the period the held for sale criteria are met 
the fair value less estimated costs to sell of the property disposal group should be assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale 
depreciation ceases as long as a property is classified as held for sale 
if circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and a subsequent decision not to sell a property classified as held for sale were to occur  the property is reclassified as held and used 
the property is measured at the time of reclassification at the lower of its a carrying amount before it was classified as held for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense or impairment losses that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or b fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell 
the effect of any required adjustment is reflected in income from continuing operations at the date of the decision not to sell 
the company recorded impairment charges totaling million  million  and million  respectively  for the years ended december    and related to real estate properties and other long lived assets 
the impairment charges in included million related to properties sold and million related to one property classified as held for sale  reducing the company carrying value on the property to the estimated fair value of the property less estimated costs to sell 
the impairment charges in included million related to two properties sold and million related to five properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values less estimated costs to sell 
the impairment charges in included million related to one property sold and million related to five properties classified as held for sale in  reducing the company carrying values on the properties to the estimated fair values less estimated costs to sell 
one of the properties classified as held for sale during was re leased during and was reclassified to held and used  resulting in a reclassification of a million impairment charge recorded in on the property from discontinued operations to continuing operations 

table of contents the company also performs an annual goodwill impairment review 
the company reviews are performed as of december of each year 
the company and reviews indicated that no impairment had occurred with respect to the company million net goodwill asset 
depreciation of real estate assets and amortization of related intangible assets as of december   the company had investments of approximately billion in depreciable real estate assets and related intangible assets 
when real estate assets and related intangible assets are acquired or placed in service  they must be depreciated or amortized 
management s judgment involves determining which depreciation method to use  estimating the economic life of the building and improvement components of real estate assets  and estimating the value of intangible assets acquired when real estate assets are purchased that have in place leases 
as described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  when the company acquires real estate properties with in place leases  the cost of the acquisition must be allocated between the acquired tangible real estate assets as if vacant and any acquired intangible assets 
such intangible assets could include above or below market in place leases and at market in place leases  which could include the opportunity costs associated with absorption period rentals  direct costs associated with obtaining new leases such as tenant improvements  and customer relationship assets 
with regard to the elements of estimating the as if vacant values of the building and the intangible assets  including the absorption period  occupancy increases during the absorption period  and tenant improvement amounts  the company uses the same absorption period and occupancy assumptions for similar building types 
any remaining excess purchase price is then allocated to goodwill 
the identifiable tangible and intangible assets are then subject to depreciation and amortization 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis unless circumstances suggest that a more frequent evaluation is warranted 
with respect to the building components  there are several depreciation methods available under gaap 
some methods record relatively more depreciation expense on an asset in the early years of the asset s economic life  and relatively less depreciation expense on the asset in the later years of its economic life 
the straight line method of depreciating real estate assets is the method the company follows because  in the opinion of management  it is the method that most accurately and consistently allocates the cost of the asset over its estimated life 
the company assigns a useful life to its owned buildings based on many factors  including the age of the property when acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses many of the company s investments are subject to long term leases or other financial support arrangements with hospital systems and healthcare providers affiliated with the properties 
due to the nature of the company s agreements  the company s accounts receivable  notes receivable and interest receivables result mainly from monthly billings of contractual tenant rents  lease guaranty amounts  principal and interest payments due on notes and mortgage notes receivable  late fees and additional rent 
payments on the company s accounts receivable are normally collected within days of billing 
when receivables remain uncollected  management must decide whether it believes the receivable is collectible and whether to provide an allowance for all or a portion of these receivables 
unlike a financial institution with a large volume of homogeneous retail receivables such as credit card loans or automobile loans that have a predictable loss pattern over time  the company s receivable losses have historically been infrequent  and are tied to a unique or specific event 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is generally based on specific identification and is recorded for a specific receivable amount once determined that such an allowance is needed 
the company also evaluates collectability of its mortgage notes and notes receivable 
a loan is impaired when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan as scheduled  including both contractual interest and principal payments 
management monitors the age and collectability of receivables on an ongoing basis 
at least monthly  a report is produced whereby all receivables are aged or placed into groups based on the number of days that have elapsed since the receivable was billed 
management reviews the aging report for evidence of deterioration in the timeliness of payments from tenants  sponsoring health systems or borrowers 
whenever deterioration is noted  management investigates and determines the reason s for the delay  which may include discussions with the delinquent tenant  sponsoring health system or borrower 
considering all information gathered  management s judgment must be exercised in determining whether a receivable is potentially uncollectible and  if so  how much or what percentage may be uncollectible 
among the factors management considers in determining uncollectibility are the following 
table of contents type of contractual arrangement under which the receivable was recorded  eg  a mortgage note  a triple net lease  a gross lease  a property operating agreement or some other type of agreement  tenant s or debtor s reason for slow payment  industry influences and healthcare segment under which the tenant or debtor operates  evidence of willingness and ability of the tenant or debtor to pay the receivable  credit worthiness of the tenant or debtor  collateral  security deposit  letters of credit or other monies held as security  tenant s or debtor s historical payment pattern  other contractual agreements between the tenant or debtor and the company  relationship between the tenant or debtor and the company  state in which the tenant or debtor operates  and existence of a guarantor and the willingness and ability of the guarantor to pay the receivable 
considering these factors and others  management must conclude whether all or some of the aged receivable balance is likely uncollectible 
if management determines that some portion of a receivable is likely uncollectible  the company records a provision for bad debt expense for the amount expected to be uncollectible 
there is a risk that management s estimate is over or under stated  however  management believes that this risk is mitigated by the fact that it re evaluates the allowance at least once each quarter and bases its estimates on the most current information available 
as such  any over or under stated estimates in the allowance should be adjusted for as soon as new and better information becomes available
