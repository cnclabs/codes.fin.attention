table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states inherently involves the use of estimates and assumptions  which affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the related disclosures 
these estimates relate principally to the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  intangible assets and the fair value of financial instruments 
such estimates and assumptions may change over time and actual amounts realized may differ from those reported 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies and estimates that management believes are the most critical 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of the probable losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio through the balance sheet date 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged to operating expense and is reduced by net loan charge offs 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is based on past loan loss experience  evaluations of known impaired loans  levels of adversely classified loans  general economic conditions and other environmental factors 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the majority of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent 
for collateral dependent loans  the amount of impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the underlying collateral and is included in the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is first estimated by each business unit s management based on their evaluation of their unit s portfolio 
this evaluation involves identifying impaired and adversely classified loans 
specific allowances for losses are determined for impaired loans based on either the loans estimated discounted cash flows or the fair values of the collateral 
allowances for adversely classified loans are estimated using historical loss percentages for each type of loan adjusted for various economic and environmental factors related to the underlying loans 
an allowance is also estimated for non adversely classified loans using a historical loss percentage based on losses arising specifically from non adversely classified loans  adjusted for various economic and environmental factors related to the underlying loans 
each month the company s senior loan committee reviews each business unit s allowance  and the aggregate allowance for the company and  on a quarterly basis  adjusts and approves the adequacy of the allowance 
in addition  annually or more frequently as needed  the senior loan committee evaluates and establishes the loss percentages used in the estimates of the allowance based on historical loss data  and giving consideration to their assessment of current economic and environmental conditions 
to facilitate the senior loan committee s evaluation  the company s asset quality department performs periodic reviews of each of the company s business units and reports on the adequacy of management s identification of impaired and adversely classified loans  and their adherence to the company s loan policies and procedures 
the process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves the exercise of judgment and consideration of numerous subjective factors and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the estimate of incurred losses will not change in light of future developments and economic conditions 
different assumptions and conditions could result in a materially different amount for the allowance for loan losses 
income taxes the company files a consolidated income tax return 
deferred taxes are recognized under the liability method based upon the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using the tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the periods when the related temporary differences are expected to be realized 
the amount of accrued current and deferred income taxes is based on estimates of taxes due or receivable from taxing authorities either currently or in the future 
changes in these accruals are reported as tax expense  and involve 
table of contents estimates of the various components included in determining taxable income  tax credits  other taxes and temporary differences 
changes periodically occur in the estimates due to changes in tax rates  tax laws and regulations  and implementation of new tax planning strategies 
the process of determining the accruals for income taxes necessarily involves the exercise of considerable judgment and consideration of numerous subjective factors 
management performs an analysis of the company s tax positions annually and believes it is more likely than not that all of its tax positions will be utilized in future years 
intangible assets and goodwill core deposit intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of seven to ten years and customer relationship intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of twelve to eighteen years 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized based on current prepayment assumptions 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated at a reporting unit level at least annually for impairment or more frequently if other indicators of impairment are present 
at least annually in the fourth quarter  intangible assets  excluding mortgage servicing rights  are evaluated for possible impairment 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair values of the intangible assets with their recorded amounts 
any impairment losses are reported in the statement of comprehensive income 
mortgage servicing rights are adjusted to fair value quarterly  if impaired 
the evaluation of remaining core deposit intangibles for possible impairment involves reassessing the useful lives and the recoverability of the intangible assets 
the evaluation of the useful lives is performed by reviewing the levels of core deposits of the respective branches acquired 
the actual life of a core deposit base may be longer than originally estimated due to more successful retention of customers  or may be shorter due to more rapid runoff 
amortization of core deposit intangibles would be adjusted  if necessary  to amortize the remaining net book values over the remaining lives of the core deposits 
the evaluation for recoverability is only performed if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the intangibles may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of goodwill for possible impairment is performed by comparing the fair values of the related reporting units with their carrying amounts including goodwill 
the fair values of the related business units are estimated using market data for prices of recent acquisitions of banks and branches 
the evaluation of intangible assets and goodwill for the years ended december   and resulted in no impairments 
fair value of financial instruments securities that are being held for indefinite periods of time  or that may be sold as part of the company s asset liability management strategy  to provide liquidity or for other reasons  are classified as available for sale and are stated at estimated fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale are reported as a component of stockholders equity  net of income tax 
securities that are determined to be impaired  and for which such impairment is determined to be other than temporary  are adjusted to fair value and a corresponding loss is recognized in earnings 
the estimates of fair values of securities and other financial instruments are based on a variety of factors 
in some cases  fair values represent quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments 
in other cases  fair values have been estimated based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates reflecting varying degrees of risk 
accordingly  the fair values may not represent actual values of the financial instruments that could have been realized as of year end or that will be realized in the future 
future application of accounting standards see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements and their expected impact on the company s financial statements 

table of contents segment information see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding the company s operating business segments 
results of operations net interest income net interest income  which is the company s principal source of operating revenue  increased in by million  to a total of million  compared to an increase of million in and an increase of million in in  net interest income increased due primarily to higher loan volume 
in  million of the increase in net interest income was related to the company s acquisitions made in the latter part of and during in  net interest income increased due to the decrease in interest rates along with approximately million of the increase relating to the company s acquisitions made in the latter part of the net interest margin is the ratio of taxable equivalent net interest income to average earning assets for the period 
the net interest margin for was  compared to for and for net interest margin has decreased in recent years due to continued historically low interest rates  the maturity or pay down of higher yielding earning assets and an increase in earning assets at relatively low rates 
changes in the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in interest rates  determine the changes in net interest income 
the following volume rate analysis summarizes the relative contribution of each of these components to the changes in net interest income in and if interest rates and or loan volume do not increase  management expects continued compression of its net interest margin in as higher yielding loans and securities mature and are replaced at current market rates 
volume rate analysis taxable equivalent basis change in change in total due to volume due to rate total due to volume due to rate dollars in thousands increase decrease interest income loans investments taxable investments tax exempt interest bearing deposits with banks and federal funds sold total interest income interest expense transaction deposits savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest expense net interest income changes in the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have been combined with the changes due to volume 

table of contents the following interest rate sensitivity analysis measures the sensitivity of the company s net interest margin to changes in interest rates by analyzing the repricing relationship between its earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this analysis is limited by the fact that it presents a static position as of a single day and is not necessarily indicative of the company s position at any other point in time  and does not take into account the sensitivity of rates of specific assets and liabilities to changes in market rates 
the company s approach to managing the interest sensitivity gap limits risk while taking advantage of the company s stable core deposit base and the historical existence of a positively sloped yield curve 
the analysis of interest rate sensitivity presents the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities based on maturity and repricing frequency at december  the company s cumulative negative gap position in the one year interval decreased to million at december  from million at december   and decreased as a percentage of total earning assets to from at december  and  respectively 
this negative gap position assumes that the company s core savings and transaction deposits are immediately rate sensitive 
in a falling rate or sustained low rate environment  the benefit of the company s noninterest bearing funds is decreased  resulting in a decrease in the company s net interest margin over time 
analysis of interest rate sensitivity december  interest rate sensitive noninterest rate sensitive to months to months to years over years total dollars in thousands earning assets loans securities federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits total funding sources noninterest bearing demand deposits savings and transaction deposits time deposits of or more time deposits under short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures stockholders equity total interest sensitivity gap cumulative gap cumulative gap as a percentage of total earning assets represents the amount of demand deposits required to support earning assets in excess of interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity 

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for  compared to million for and million for the decrease in the provision for loan losses during compared to reflects a decreasing trend in the level of adversely classified loans 
during  million of the increase in the provision for loan losses was related to the company s bank acquisitions made in the latter part of and during  credit quality generally stabilized as previously identified problem loans were moved to other real estate owned while potential problem loans decreased 
the company establishes an allowance as an estimate of the probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
management believes the recorded amount of the allowance for loan losses is appropriate based upon management s best estimate of probable losses that have been incurred within the existing loan portfolio 
should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses change  the company s estimate of probable loan losses could also change  which could affect the level of future provisions for loan losses 
net loan charge offs were million for compared to million for and million for the net charge offs equated to  and of average loans for  and  respectively 
a more detailed discussion of the allowance for loan losses is provided under loans including acquired loans 
noninterest income noninterest income was million in versus million in and million in total noninterest income increased million in  an increase of 
this compares to an increase of million  or  in for  the increases in revenues were primarily from a million pretax securities gain from the sale of an investment by the company s small business investment corporation  council oak investment corporation  a wholly owned subsidiary of bancfirst 
in addition  revenues from trust services  deposit revenues and insurance commissions increased in for  the company s bank acquisitions made in the latter part of and increased noninterest income by approximately million 
in addition  noninterest income increased in due to a securities gain of million on the sale of an investment made by council oak investment corporation  higher revenues from trust services  deposit revenues and insurance commissions 
noninterest income was higher in due to higher revenues from trust services  deposit revenues and insurance commissions  partially offset by lower cash management revenues 
the company s noninterest income has increased in each of the last five years due to improved pricing strategies  enhanced product lines  acquisitions and internal deposit growth 
the company had revenue from debit card usage totaling million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the recently enacted dodd frank act has given the federal reserve the authority to establish rules regarding debit card interchange fees charged for electronic debit transactions by payment card issuers 
because of the uncertainty as to any future rulemaking by the federal reserve and the inability to forecast competitive responses  the company cannot provide any assurance as to the ultimate impact of the dodd frank act on the amount of revenue from debit card usage reported in future periods 
the company recognized a net gain on the sale of securities of million in  million in and  in  due primarily to investment sales made by the company s small business investment corporation subsidiary  council oak investment corporation 
the company s practice is to maintain a liquid portfolio of securities and not engage in trading activities 
the company has the ability and intent to hold securities classified as available for sale that were in an unrealized loss position until they mature or until fair value exceeds amortized cost 
the company earned million on the sale of loans in compared to million in and million in activity in the secondary mortgage market increased in compared to due to a large number of refinancings in the historically low interest rate environment 
in  the activity also increased due to a large number of refinancings in the historically low interest rate environment and the final sale of the student loans portfolio occurred 
student loan activity ceased during when congress passed student loan reform legislation centralizing student lending in a governmental agency  which eliminated guaranteed student lending by financial institutions 

table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased by million  or to million for this compares to increases of million  or  for  and million  or  for the increase in noninterest expense during primarily related to an increase in salaries and benefits of approximately million and merger related costs of approximately million 
the increase in noninterest expense during was primarily related to the company s bank acquisitions made in the latter part of and  which added approximately million of noninterest expense 
other factors were an increase in salaries and benefits excluding acquisitions of approximately million  write downs on other real estate of million  and merger related expenses of approximately  partially offset by a gain on the sale of other real estate of approximately million 
noninterest expense increased in due to higher benefit and acquisition costs  partially offset by lower fdic insurance costs 
noninterest expense included deposit insurance expense which totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in deposit insurance expense during compared to and was primarily related to the change in the deposit insurance assessment base and a change in the method by which the assessment rate is determined  which became effective in income taxes income tax expense totaled million in  compared to million in and million for the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the difference between the company s effective tax rate and the federal statutory rate were tax exempt income  nondeductible amortization  federal and state tax credits  and state tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate decreased in due to increased federal tax credits allowed for the year 
certain financial information is prepared on a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate analysis of yields and changes in components of earnings 
average balance sheets  comprehensive income statements and other financial statistics are also presented on a taxable equivalent basis 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on financial institutions differs significantly from that of industrial or commercial companies 
the assets of financial institutions are predominantly monetary  as opposed to fixed or nonmonetary assets such as premises  equipment and inventory 
as a result  there is little exposure to inflated earnings by understated depreciation charges or significantly understated current values of assets 
although inflation can have an indirect effect by leading to higher interest rates  financial institutions are in a position to monitor the effects on interest costs and yields and respond to inflationary trends through management of interest rate sensitivity 
inflation can also have an impact on noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  services and other costs 
impact of deflation in a period of deflation  it would be reasonable to expect widely decreasing prices for real assets 
in such an economic environment  assets of businesses and individuals  such as real estate  commodities or inventory  could decline 
the inability of customers to repay or refinance their loans could result in loan losses incurred by the company far in excess of historical experience due to deflated collateral values 
financial position cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks cash consists of cash and cash items on hand  noninterest bearing deposits and amounts due from other banks  reserves deposited with the federal reserve bank  and interest bearing deposits with other banks 
federal funds sold consist of overnight investments of excess funds with other financial institutions 
due to the federal 
table of contents reserve bank s intervention into the funds market that has resulted in near zero overnight funds rates  the company has continued to maintain the majority of its excess funds with the federal reserve bank 
the federal reserve bank pays interest on these funds based upon the lowest target rate for the maintenance period 
the amount of cash  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with the federal reserve bank carried by the company is a function of the availability of funds presented to other institutions for clearing  and the company s requirements for liquidity  operating cash and reserves  available yields  and interest rate sensitivity management 
balances of these items can fluctuate widely based on these various factors 
cash and federal funds sold increased million in  million in and million in the increases were primarily due to increased deposits 
securities for the year ended december   total securities decreased million  or  to million 
this compares to a decrease of million  or in and an increase of million  or  in the decreases for and were the result of historically low yields on us treasury and federal agency securities and the company s decision to not reinvest maturing securities by purchasing longer term fixed rate securities at such low yields 
for the year ended december   securities increased due to acquisitions and higher pledging requirements for public deposits 
securities available for sale represented of the total securities portfolio at december   compared to at december  and at december  securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of million at december   compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december  and a net unrealized gain of million at december  these unrealized gains are included in the company s stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income tax  in the amounts of million  million and million for december   and respectively

any sales of securities are for the purpose of executing the company s asset liability management strategy  eliminating a perceived credit risk in a specific security  or providing liquidity 
securities that are being held for indefinite periods of time  or that may be sold as part of the company s asset liability management strategy  to provide liquidity  or for other reasons  are classified as available for sale and are stated at estimated fair value 
unrealized gains or losses on securities available for sale are reported as a component of stockholders equity  net of income tax 
securities for which the 
table of contents company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held for investment and are stated at cost  adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts computed under the interest method 
securities that are determined to be impaired  and for which such impairment is determined to be other than temporary  are adjusted to fair value and a corresponding loss is recognized 
gains or losses from sales of securities are based upon the book values of the specific securities sold 
declines in the fair value of held for investment and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management has the ability and intent to hold the securities classified as held for investment until they mature  at which time the company will receive full value for the securities 
as of december   the company had net unrealized gains largely due to decreases in market interest rates from the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased 
the fair value of those securities having unrealized losses is expected to recover as the securities approach their maturity date or repricing date  or if market yields for similar investments decline 
management does not believe any of the securities are impaired due to reasons of credit quality 
furthermore  as of december   management also had the ability and intent to hold all securities classified as available for sale with an unrealized loss for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost 
accordingly  as of december   management believes the impairments were temporary and no material impairment loss was realized in the company s consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
maturity distribution of securities the following maturity distribution of securities table summarizes the weighted average maturity and weighted average taxable equivalent yields of the securities portfolio at december  the company manages its securities portfolio for liquidity and as a tool to execute its asset liability management strategy

table of contents loans including acquired loans the company has historically generated loan growth from both internal originations and bank acquisitions 
total loans increased million  or  to billion in compared to an increase of million  or  in and an increase of million  or  in loans increased in due primarily to internal growth 
loans increased in due to both bank acquisitions and internal growth 
loans increased in due to bank acquisitions offset by the sale of the student loan portfolio 
the company added loans from bank acquisitions of approximately million in and million in composition the company s loan portfolio was diversified among various types of commercial and individual borrowers 
commercial loans were comprised principally of loans to companies in light manufacturing  retail and service industries 
consumer loans were comprised primarily of loans to individuals for automobiles 
the company did not have any credit card receivables at year end  or and does not expect to engage in this type of activity 
loans secured by real estate  including farmland  multifamily  commercial  one to four family residential and construction and development loans  have been a large portion of the company s loan portfolio 
the company is subject to risk of future market fluctuations in property values relating to these loans 
the company attempts to manage this risk through rigorous loan underwriting standards

table of contents maturity and rate sensitivity of loans the following table presents the maturity and rate sensitivity of loans at december   for commercial  financial and other loans  and real estate loans  excluding one to four family residential loans and consumer loans 
approximately of the commercial real estate and other commercial loans have maturities of one year or less 
however  many of these loans are renewed at existing or similar terms after scheduled principal reductions 
also  approximately of the commercial real estate and other commercial loans had adjustable interest rates at december  maturing within one year after one but within five years after five years total dollars in thousands commercial  financial and other real estate construction real estate farmland  multifamily and commercial excluding loans secured by to family residential properties total loans with predetermined interest rates loans with adjustable interest rates total percentage of total during the company set rate floors on the majority of its adjustable rate loans 
at december  approximately of the adjustable rate loan portfolio was at the floor rate 
short term rates would have to increase approximately basis points before these loans would experience an increase in rate 
the information relating to the maturity and rate sensitivity of loans is based upon contractual maturities and original loan terms 
in the ordinary course of business  loans maturing within one year may be renewed  in whole or in part  at interest rates prevailing at the date of renewal 
nonperforming and restructured assets during  nonperforming and restructured assets increased million to million 
this compares to a decrease of million for and an increase of million for the company s level of nonperforming and restructured assets has continued to be relatively low  equating to  and of total assets at december   and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans have decreased each of the last three years from million at the end of to million at the end of the decrease in was primarily due to the transfer of several commercial properties from nonaccrual loans to other real estate owned 
the decrease in was due to the transfer of two commercial properties totaling million from nonaccrual loans to other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans negatively impact the company s net interest margin 
a loan is placed on nonaccrual status when  in the opinion of management  the future collectability of interest or principal or both is in serious doubt 
interest income is recognized on certain of these loans on a cash basis if the full collection of the remaining principal balance is reasonably expected 
otherwise  interest income is not recognized until the principal balance is fully collected 
total interest income which was not accrued on nonaccrual loans outstanding was approximately million at december   million at december  and million at december  only a small amount of this interest is expected to be ultimately collected 
interest income for included interest collected from the disposition of nonperforming assets of million 

table of contents restructured loans increased million in primarily due to the deferral of principal payments on one commercial real estate loan with a balance of approximately million 
this loan was evaluated by management and determined to be well collateralized 
additionally  none of the concessions granted involved a principal reduction or a change from the current market rate of interest 
the value of the collateral will be monitored to evaluate possible impairment of the loan 
the company charges interest on principal balances outstanding during deferral periods 
as a result  the current and future financial effects of the recorded balance of loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings whose terms were modified during the period were not considered to be material 
the classification of a loan as nonperforming does not necessarily indicate that loan principal and interest will ultimately be uncollectible  although  in an economic downturn  the company s experience has been that the level of collections decline 
the above normal risk associated with nonperforming loans has been considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming and restructured loans was  compared to  at the end of and at the end of the level of nonperforming loans and loan losses could rise over time as a result of adverse economic conditions 
other real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure  and premises held for sale 
these properties are carried at the lower of the book values of the related loans or fair values based upon appraisals  less estimated costs to sell 
write downs arising at the time of reclassification of such properties from loans to other real estate owned are charged directly to the allowance for loan losses 
any losses on bank premises designated to be sold are charged to operating expense at the time of transfer from premises to other real estate owned 
decreases in values of properties subsequent to their classification as other real estate owned are charged to operating expense 
at december   other real estate owned and repossessed assets decreased as shown in the following table 
the decrease in was due in part to the sale of a commercial real estate property valued at million 
the decrease in was due in part to the sale of one nonperforming commercial real estate property valued at million  sold at a sheriff s sale  which fully recovered the principal balance and the interest due on the related loan 
the increase during was due to the transfer to other real estate owned of two commercial properties totaling million that were previously in nonaccrual loans

the company had approximately million  million and million of these loans at december   and  respectively  which were not included in nonperforming and restructured loans 
in general  these loans are adequately collateralized and have no specific identifiable probable loss 
loans which are considered to have identifiable probable loss potential are placed on nonaccrual status  are allocated a specific allowance for loss or are directly charged down  and are reported as nonperforming 
the company s nonaccrual loans are primarily commercial and real estate loans 

table of contents allowance for loan losses fair value adjustments on acquired loans the allowance for loan losses is management s estimate of the probable losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio through the balance sheet date 
management s process for determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is described under critical accounting policies and estimates above 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses has increased in each of the past three years  but has decreased as a percentage of total loans

liquidity and funding the company s principal source of liquidity and funding is its broad deposit base generated from customer relationships 
the availability of deposits is affected by economic conditions  competition with other financial institutions  and alternative investments available to customers 
through interest rates paid  service charge levels and services offered  the company can  to a limited extent  affect its level of deposits 
the level and maturity of funding necessary to support the company s lending and investment functions is determined through the company s asset liability management process 
in addition to deposits  short term borrowings comprised primarily of federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements provide additional funding sources 
the company currently does not rely heavily on long term borrowings and does not utilize brokered cds 
the company maintains federal funds lines of credit with other banks and could also utilize the sale of loans  securities  and liquidation of other assets as sources of liquidity and funding 
historically  the bank is more liquid than its peers 
this liquidity positions the bank to respond to increased loan demand and other requirements for funds  or to decreases in funding sources 
the liquidity of bancfirst corporation  however  is dependent upon dividend payments from the bank and its ability to obtain financing 
banking regulations limit bank dividends based upon net earnings retained by the bank and minimum capital requirements 
dividends in excess of these limits require regulatory approval

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rates and prices  such as equity prices 
the risk of loss can be assessed from the perspective of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows  and future earnings 
due to the nature of its operations  the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk arising principally from its lending  investing  deposit and borrowing activities and  to a lesser extent  liquidity risk 
interest rate risk on the company s balance sheet consists of repricing  option  and basis risks 
repricing risk results from the differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the company 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates and indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of the profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as savings accounts  negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the company seeks to reduce fluctuations in its net interest margin and to optimize net interest income with acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
accordingly  the company s interest rate sensitivity and liquidity are monitored on an ongoing basis by its asset and liability committee alco 

table of contents alco establishes risk measures  limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
a variety of measures are used to provide for a comprehensive view of the magnitude of interest rate risk  the distribution of risk  the level of risk over time and the exposure to changes in certain interest rate relationships 
the company utilizes an earnings simulation model as a quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on projected net interest income over the next months 
these simulations incorporate assumptions regarding pricing and the repricing and maturity characteristics of the existing balance sheet 
the alco continuously monitors and manages the balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the objective is to manage the impact of fluctuating market rates on net interest income within acceptable levels 
in order to meet this objective  management may lengthen or shorten the duration of assets or liabilities 
as of december   the model simulations projected that a and basis point increase would result in positive variance in net interest income of and  respectively  relative to the base case over the next months 
conversely  the model simulation projected that a decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a negative variance in net interest income of relative to the base case over the next months 
the likelihood of a decrease in interest rates beyond basis points as of december  was considered to be remote given prevailing interest rate levels 
the following table presents the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  their expected maturities and their estimated fair values at december  avg 
rate expected maturity principal repayments at december  balance fair value thereafter dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets loans securities federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits interest sensitive liabilities savings and transaction deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings junior subordinated debentures off balance sheet items loan commitments letters of credit the expected maturities and principal repayments are based upon the contractual terms of the instruments 
prepayments have been estimated for certain instruments with predictable prepayment rates 
savings and transaction deposits are assumed to mature all in the first year as they are not subject to withdrawal restrictions and any assumptions regarding decay rates would be very subjective 
the actual maturities and principal repayments for the financial instruments could vary substantially from the contractual terms and assumptions used in the analysis
