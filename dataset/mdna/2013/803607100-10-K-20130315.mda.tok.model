item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those identified below  and those discussed in the section titled risk factors included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
throughout this discussion  unless the context specifies or implies otherwise  the terms sarepta  we  us and our refer to sarepta therapeutics  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique rna based therapeutics for the treatment of rare and infectious diseases 
applying our proprietary  highly differentiated and innovative platform technologies  we are able to target a broad range of diseases and disorders through distinct rna based mechanisms of action 
we are primarily focused on rapidly advancing the development of our duchenne muscular dystrophy drug candidates  including our lead product candidate  eteplirsen  which is currently in a phase iib trial 
we are also focused on developing therapeutics for the treatment of infectious diseases and leveraging our rna based technology platforms to identify additional product candidates and explore various strategic opportunities 
our lead program focuses on the development of disease modifying therapeutic candidates for duchenne muscular dystrophy  or dmd  a rare genetic muscle wasting disease caused by the absence of dystrophin  a protein necessary for muscle function 
eteplirsen is our lead therapeutic candidate for dmd 
if we are successful in our development efforts  eteplirsen will address a severe unmet medical need 
restoration of dystrophin expression and dystrophin positive fibers is believed to be critical for successful disease modifying treatment of individuals with dmd 
we initiated a phase iib trial for eteplirsen in august and in april  we announced this trial met the primary efficacy endpoint of increasing novel dystrophin at weeks  when compared to placebo delayed treatment cohort 
at the end of the phase iib trial  we initiated an open label extension trial with the same participants where we demonstrated a statistically significant benefit over the placebo delayed treatment cohort in the minute walk test after and weeks of treatment with eteplirsen 
we are currently expecting to initiate a pivotal clinical trial for eteplirsen by the end of and commencing dosing in this trial by early we are also in the early stages of identifying additional exon skipping drug candidates for the treatment of dmd which addresses different genetic imperfections than eteplirsen 
we are also leveraging the capabilities of our rna based technology platforms to develop therapeutics for the treatment of infectious diseases 
our primary program for infectious diseases is for the treatment of marburg virus  a severe and fatal disease which is characterized as a category a bioterrorism agent by the centers for disease control and prevention and a material threat to national security by the department of homeland security 
currently  there are no treatments beyond supportive care 
our lead therapeutic candidate against the marburg virus  avi  has shown positive safety results when administered intravenously to healthy human volunteers and a survival rate in non human primates of to when daily treatments were begun between and hours after infection compared to survival in the placebo group 
in addition  we recently completed a study administering avi via intramuscular injection and the results indicated the drug was well tolerated and achieved high survival rates similar to previous studies where avi was administered intravenously 
the us department of defense  or dod  has provided significant financial support for the development of therapeutics against ebola  marburg  dengue and influenza viruses 
the basis for our novel rna based therapeutics is our phosphorodiamidate linked morpholino oligomer  or pmo  chemistries 
unlike other rna based therapeutics  which are often used to down regulate gene expression  our technologies can be used to selectively up regulate or down regulate the production of a target protein  or direct the expression of novel proteins involved in human diseases and disorders 
further  we believe 
table of contents the charge neutral nature of our pmo based molecules may have the potential to reduce off target effects  such as immune stimulatory effects often seen in alternative rna based technologies 
we believe that our highly differentiated  novel proprietary and innovative rna based technology platforms  based on charge neutral morpholino oligomers  may represent a significant improvement over traditional rna based technologies 
as of february   we owned or controlled approximately us and corresponding foreign patents and us and corresponding foreign patent applications 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses of approximately million and substantially all of our revenue has been derived from research and development contracts with the us government 
we have not yet generated any material revenue from product sales and we have incurred expenses related to research and development  general and administrative charges and acquired in process research and development resulting from two acquisitions 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development efforts and seek approval from various regulatory agencies for our product candidates  but there can be no assurance that we will obtain approval for our product candidates and achieve revenues from product sales 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million which  we believe is sufficient to fund operations for more than the next twelve months 
should our funding from the us government cease or be delayed  we would likely curtail certain of our infectious disease research and development efforts unless additional funding was obtained 
we are also likely to pursue securing additional cash resources through public or private financings  seeking additional government contracts  and from establishing collaborations or licensing our technology to other companies 
the likelihood of our long term success must be considered in light of the expenses  difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products  competitive factors in the marketplace  the risks associated with us government sponsored programs  and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that we will ever achieve significant revenues or profitable operations 
us government contracts in the periods presented  nearly all of the revenue we generated was derived from research contracts with and grants from the us government 
as of december   we had substantially completed all of our contracts with the us government except for the marburg portion of the july agreement for the development of therapeutics against ebola and marburg viruses and the august agreement for the intramuscular administration of our drug candidate against the marburg virus 
the following table sets forth the revenue from each of our contracts with the us government and other revenue for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands july agreement ebola and marburg august agreement intramuscular administration june agreement hn may agreement hn november agreement ebola  marburg and jun n viruses grants other agreements total the following is a description of each of our significant us government contracts and grants 

table of contents july agreement ebola and marburg on july   we were awarded a contract with the dod chemical and biological defense program through the us army space and missile defense command for the advanced development of our hemorrhagic fever virus therapeutic candidates  avi and avi  against the ebola and marburg viruses  respectively 
in february  we announced that we received permission from the fda to proceed with a single oligomer from avi  avi  as the lead product candidate against marburg virus infection 
on august   we received a stop work order related to the ebola virus portion of the contract and  on october   the us government terminated the ebola portion of the contract for convenience of the government due to government funding constraints 
the remaining marburg portion of the contract is structured into four segments and has an aggregate remaining period of performance spanning approximately four years if dod exercises its options for all segments 
our activities under the first segment began in july and include phase i studies in healthy volunteers as well as preclinical studies 
the first segment is scheduled to be completed in the first half of subject to agreement with dod 
the remaining funding for the current marburg segment of the contract is approximately million 
after completion of the first segment  and each successive segment  dod has the option to proceed to the next segment 
if dod exercises its options for segments ii  iii and iv  our contract activities would include all clinical and licensure activities necessary to obtain fda regulatory approval for our therapeutic candidate against the marburg virus 
the funding for segments ii  iii and iv of the marburg virus portion of the contract is estimated to be approximately million 
august agreement intramuscular administration on august   we were awarded a contract from the us department of defense s joint project manager transformational medical technologies jpm tmt program  a component of the us department of defense s joint program executive office for chemical and biological defense 
the contract is for approximately million to evaluate the feasibility of an intramuscular im route of administration using avi  our candidate for treatment of marburg virus 
the period of performance of this contract is scheduled to conclude in the second half of under the july agreement ebola and marburg described above  we are developing avi as an intravenous formulation 
june agreement hn influenza on june   we entered into a contract with the defense threat reduction agency dtra to advance the development of avi as a medical countermeasure against the pandemic hn influenza virus in cooperation with the transformational medical technologies program  or tmt  of the us department of defense  or dod 
the period of performance for this contract ended on june  may agreement hn influenza in may  we entered into a contract with dtra to develop swine flu drugs using our proprietary pmo and pmoplus antisense chemistry 
in march  the contract was amended to include testing against additional influenza strains 
we have agreed with dtra that the key activities under this contract were completed in november agreement ebola  marburg and jun n viruses in november  we entered into a research contract with dtra to fund the development of our antisense therapeutic candidates against ebola  marburg and jun n hemorrhagic viruses 
in november  we and dtra agreed that the key activities under this contract had been completed 

table of contents qualifying therapeutic discovery project in october  we were awarded five cash grants for our dmd program and infectious disease programs totaling approximately million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project  or qtdp  and recognized the entire amount as revenue in we will not receive any further funding under the qtdp grants 
key financial metrics revenue government research contract and grant revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is generated from us government research contracts and grants 
see note us government contracts of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we recognize revenue from us government research contracts and grants during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses gross in the consolidated financial statements 
license arrangements 
our license arrangements may consist of non refundable upfront license fees  data transfer fees  research reimbursement payments  exclusive licensed rights to patented or patent pending compounds  technology access fees  various performance or sales milestones and future product royalty payments 
some of these arrangements are multiple element arrangements 
we defer recognition of non refundable upfront fees if we have continuing performance obligations when the technology  right  product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non refundable fee has no utility to the licensee that is separate and independent of our performance under the other elements of the arrangement 
in addition  if we have continuing involvement through research and development services that are required because of our know how or because the services can only be performed by us  then such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement 
as of december   we had deferred revenue of million  which represents up front fees which we will recognize as revenue as we satisfy the outstanding performance obligations 
expenses research and development 
research and development expense consists of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies  and clinical trial and manufacturing costs 
direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include salaries  stock based compensation  and an allocation of our facility costs 
the amount and timing of future research and development expense will depend in part on our ability to obtain us government awards to fund the advanced development of our infectious disease therapeutic candidates 
without such funding  we would likely significantly reduce our spending in these areas 
future research and development expenses may also increase as our internal projects  such as eteplirsen for dmd  enter later stage clinical development 
our research and development programs are in phase iib clinical trials or earlier and may not result in any approved products 
product candidates that appear promising at early stages of development may not reach the market for a variety of reasons 
similarly  any of our product candidates may be found to be ineffective during clinical trials  may take longer to complete clinical trials than we have anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals  or may prove impracticable to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost and with acceptable quality 

table of contents as a result of these uncertainties and the other risks inherent in the drug development process  we cannot determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of any of our product candidates 
similarly  we cannot determine when  if  or to what extent we may generate revenue from the commercialization and sale of any product candidate 
the timeframe for development of any product candidate  associated development costs  and the probability of regulatory and commercial success vary widely 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists principally of salaries  benefits  stock based compensation expense  and related costs for personnel in our executive  finance  legal  information technology  business development and human resource functions 
other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net  primarily consists of interest on our cash and cash equivalents  interest expense  and rental income 
our cash equivalents consist of money market investments 
interest expense includes interest paid on our mortgage loan related to the corvallis property  the substantial portion of which we leased in november rental income is from subleasing excess space in some of our facilities 
gain loss on change in warrant valuation 
warrants issued in connection with our december and january and august financings are classified as liabilities as opposed to equity due to their settlement terms 
these warrants are non cash liabilities  we are not required to expend any cash to settle these liabilities 
the fair market value of these warrants was recorded on the balance sheet at issuance and the warrants are marked to market each financial reporting period  with changes in the fair value recorded as a gain or loss in our statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of significant judgment and estimates related to the inputs used in the model and can result in significant swings in the fair market valuation primarily due to changes in our stock price 
for more information  see note warrants of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex  and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the policies that we believe are the most critical to aid the understanding of our financial results include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  and accounting for and valuation of warrants classified as liabilities 
revenue recognition we have historically generated revenue from our us government research contracts and grants and other license arrangements 
for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policies  see key financial 
table of contents metrics above and note summary of significant accounting policies of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
stock compensation expense to determine stock based compensation costs  we apply the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  share based payments 
we use the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards on the date of grant  which requires the use of subjective and complex assumptions to determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the award s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we recognize the value of the portion of the awards that is ultimately expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight line basis for the entire award 
stock awards granted to employees are service based and prior to december  typically vest over a three year period  with one third of the underlying shares vesting on each anniversary of grant  and have a ten year term 
beginning in january  newly granted stock awards have a ten year term and typically vest over a four year period  with one fourth of the underlying shares vesting on the first anniversary of the grant and th of the underlying shares vesting monthly thereafter  such that the underlying shares will be fully vested on the fourth anniversary of the grant 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used in determining the fair value of stock options granted year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected lives years years years expected volatility the risk free interest rate is estimated using an average of us treasury bill interest rates over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the option that correlates to the prevailing interest rates at the time of grant 
the expected dividend yield is zero as we have not paid any dividends to date and do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
the expected lives are estimated using expected and historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is estimated using calculated volatility of our common stock over a historical period commensurate with the expected life of the option 
the amounts estimated according to the black scholes option pricing model may not be indicative of the actual values realized upon the exercise of these options by the holders 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation expense represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note stock compensation of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a further discussion of stock based compensation 
warrant liability in december and january and august of  we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock in connection with offerings of our common stock 
these warrants are classified as a liability due to their settlement terms 
these warrants are non cash liabilities  we are not required to expend any cash to settle these liabilities 

table of contents the fair value of the warrants is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability  and fair value is adjusted at each financial reporting period with the adjustment reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
the fair value of the warrants is determined using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of significant judgment and estimates related to the inputs used in the model 
the following reflects the weighted average assumptions for each of the periods indicated year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected lives years years years expected volatility fluctuations in the assumptions and factors used in the black scholes model can result in adjustments to the fair value of the warrants reflected on our balance sheet and  therefore  our statement of operations 
if  for example  the market value of our common stock or its volatility at december  were higher or lower than what we used in the valuation of the warrants  our valuation of the warrants would have increased or decreased by million due to the change in market price  and our valuation would have increased or decreased by million due to the change in volatility  with the differences being reflected in our statement of operations 
see note warrants of the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a further discussion of warrants 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated summary of results for fiscal years  and year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts operations data revenues research and development general and administrative operating loss interest income and other  net gain loss on change in warrant valuation net loss net loss per share basic and diluted revenue revenue for decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease was due to million less revenue from the may and june hn agreements which ended in and million less revenue from the ebola and marburg contract 
of the million from the ebola and marburg contract  million was due to the ebola portion of the contract being terminated for convenience by the us government due to lack of funding in the third quarter of these decreases in revenue were partially offset by initial revenue from the im contract of million 

table of contents revenue for increased by million  or  compared to the increase was primarily due to the ebola and marburg contract we received in july  which contributed revenue of million in  an increase of million over the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by decreases in revenue on contracts we completed during  including million from the may and june hn agreements  million from the qtdp grants and a million decrease for the ebola  marburg and jun n contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease was due primarily to a million decrease in non dmd proprietary research and a million reduction in costs related to the ebola portion of the july ebola and marburg contract which the us government terminated due to a lack of funding in the third quarter of  a million reduction in costs resulting from the completion of the may and june hn government contracts in  a million reduction due to the timing of various activities in both the marburg portion of the july contract and the dmd program 
research and development expenses for increased by million  or  compared to due primarily to a million increase in costs related to the july ebola and marburg contract  a million increase in costs for our proprietary dmd program that is in phase ii clinical trials  a million increase for proprietary research and development and a million increase from manufacturing activities 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in costs related to the may and june hn contracts completed in and a million decrease related to the ebola  marburg and jun n contract  which was completed in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for decreased by million  or  compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in professional consulting services and million in severance costs 
these decreases were partially offset by million of higher personnel costs due to filling vacant senior level positions 
general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  compared to this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in personnel related costs and million in professional consulting costs 
legal fees and employee severance costs decreased by approximately million each while facility costs also increased by million 
gain loss on change in warrant valuation in  we recognized million of expense due to the increase in the fair value of our outstanding warrants that are classified as liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet and warrants exercised during in  we recognized million of income due to the reduction in the fair value of our outstanding warrants that are classified as liabilities on our december  consolidated balance sheet 
the change in fair value of our warrant liability is primarily attributable to the change in our stock price 
net loss the increase in our net loss of million for compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in other non operating income loss resulting from an increase in the fair value of warrants accounted for as liabilities partially offset by a million decrease in our operating loss 
the decrease in our net loss of million  or  for compared to was primarily attributable to a million increase in non operating income loss resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our outstanding warrants offset by an increase in operating loss of million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  compared to million at december  the significant increase is due primarily to public offerings of our common stock and the exercise of outstanding warrants for the purchase of our common stock 
based on the factors described below  we believe that our currently available cash and cash equivalents is more than sufficient to finance our operations for the next months 
our principal sources of liquidity are revenue from our us government research contracts and grants and equity transactions 
our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
our primary source of revenue is from development of product candidates pursuant to our contracts with the us government 
government funding is subject to the us government s appropriations process and the us government has the right under our contracts with them to terminate such contracts for convenience as was done regarding the ebola portion of the ebola marburg contract 
if us government funding is not received or is delayed  we would likely curtail certain of our infectious disease research and development efforts unless additional funding was obtained 
currently  we do not generate any revenue from the commercial sale of our pharmaceutical product candidates 
our future expenditures and capital requirements depend on numerous factors  most of which are difficult to project beyond the short term 
these requirements include the progress of our research and development programs and our pre clinical and clinical trials  our ability to meet the requirements of our us government research projects  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish collaborative arrangements and the terms of any such arrangements  and the costs associated with manufacturing and commercialization of our products 
our cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research  development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financing primarily from  but not limited to  the sale and issuance of equity  debt securities or the licensing or sale of our technology 
we cannot assure you that financing will be available when and as needed or that  if available  the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require  it would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
to the extent we issue additional equity securities  our existing shareholders could experience substantial dilution 
historical trends the following table sets forth sources and uses of funds activity for the period shown year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and equivalents 
table of contents operating activities 
we used million of cash in operating activities for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million of cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  in  if the non cash income effects associated with the periodic revaluation of the warrants to fair market value is excluded  our net operating loss decreased by million from primarily due to lower research and development costs partially offset by a reduction in our government contract revenue 
other activities impacting the increase in net cash used in operating activities between the comparative periods was an increase in accounts receivable and other assets of million primarily related to a deposit for manufacturing subunits  and a decrease in accounts payable  accrued employee compensation and other liabilities of million 
we used million of cash in operating activities for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million of cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities between the comparative periods was primarily attributable to a million increased operating loss  excluding the non cash income associated with the periodic revaluation of the warrants to fair market value 
this increased operating loss was primarily due to increased research and development costs  which were partially offset by higher government contract revenue 
additionally  changes in accounts payable  accrued employee compensation and other liabilities offset net cash used between the comparative periods in operating activities by million 
investing activities 
we used million of cash in investing activities for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or from the year ended december  the majority of the decrease was attributable to fewer fixed asset purchases in we used million of cash in investing activities for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million of cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  the majority of the increase in cash used for investing activities was attributable to increased expenditures for fixed assets 
financing activities 
we had financing activities for the year ended december  that provided million of cash 
during the year  we sold million shares of common stock through public offerings and received net proceeds of million 
in addition  outstanding warrant exercises during the year resulted in the issuance of million shares for which we received million in proceeds 
we also received million from the exercise of stock options 
we had financing activities for the year ended december  that provided million  primarily from a stock offering of million shares that generated net proceeds of million 
the remainder of the funds provided was due to stock option and warrant exercises partially offset by debt repayments 
as of december   we had warrants outstanding to purchase million shares of our common stock at an average price of 
these warrants expire during and if they are all exercised  would provide proceeds of million 
off balance sheet arrangements during the periods presented  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose 

table of contents contractual payment obligations in our continuing operations  we have entered into long term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities  the provision of goods and services  and acquisition of technology access rights  among others 
the following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands long term debt operating leases purchase obligations purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding to the company and that specify all significant terms 
purchase obligations relate primarily to our dmd development program 
on january   we entered into a million agreement for the manufacturing of subunits that will be delivered in and the first quarter of recent accounting pronouncements see note summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting pronouncements of the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and our cash equivalents are invested in money market accounts 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these assets in the near term due to extremely low rates of investment interest and to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents 
a decline in interest rates  occurring january  and sustained throughout the period ended december   would have been inconsequential 
future declines in interest rates  however  would reduce investment income  but are not likely to be a material source of revenue to our company in the foreseeable future
