properties mid continent the company held interests in approximately  gross  net leasehold acres in oklahoma and kansas at december  associated proved reserves at december  totaled mmboe  of which were proved developed reserves  based on estimates prepared by netherland  sewell associates  inc netherland sewell and the company s internal engineers 
the company s interests in the mid continent as of december  included  gross net producing wells with an average working interest of 
average daily net production from the mid continent area was approximately mboe for the month of december the company had rigs operating in the mid continent as of december   of which one was drilling a saltwater disposal well and were drilling horizontal wells in the mississippian formation 

table of contents mississippian formation 
the company s primary focus within the mid continent area is the mississippian formation  which is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system located on the anadarko shelf in northern oklahoma and kansas 
the top of this formation is encountered between approximately  and  feet and lies stratigraphically between the pennsylvanian aged morrow formation and the devonian aged woodford shale formation 
the mississippian formation can reach  feet in gross thickness and the targeted porosity zone is between and feet in thickness 
the formation s geology is well understood as a result of the thousands of vertical wells drilled and produced there since the s and the more than  horizontal wells drilled there since the beginning of at december   the company had approximately  gross  net acres under lease  of which approximately  gross  net acres were included in the mississippian trust i and the mississippian trust ii s areas of mutual interest 
in  the application of horizontal cased hole drilling and multi stage hydraulic fracturing treatments demonstrated the potential for extracting significant additional quantities of oil and natural gas from the mississippian formation 
since the beginning of  there have been over  horizontal wells drilled in the formation  including approximately drilled by the company as of december  from december  to december   the number of the company s producing horizontal wells in the mississippian formation increased from to the company drilled a total of horizontal wells in the mississippian formation during  including wells subject to the royalty interests of the mississippian trust i or mississippian trust ii 
the company s saltwater disposal system  constructed beginning in  and electrical infrastructure  constructed by the company s midstream services segment beginning in  assist in the economically efficient production of oil and natural gas from the mississippian formation 
the saltwater disposal system  which included active wells and approximately miles of gathering lines at december   reduces the overall cost of water disposal  which directly reduces production costs 
the company s electrical infrastructure  which consisted of approximately miles of power lines at december   distributes electricity to the company s mississippian formation operations at a lower cost than electricity provided by on site generation 
additionally  by building its own infrastructure in these rural areas  the company has been able to provide sufficient electricity to its operations 
the company is also able to obtain lower electrical rates based on aggregated volumes 
gulf of mexico the company s gulf of mexico operations  a substantial portion of which were acquired during the second quarter of with the dynamic acquisition and additional gulf of mexico properties  primarily extend from the coast to more than miles offshore and occur in waters with depths ranging from to  feet 
the company s gulf of mexico oil and natural gas properties are shallow water assets  with the exception of the bullwinkle field  which is a deepwater asset 
as of december   the company owned oil and natural gas properties in the federal and state waters in the gulf of mexico consisting of approximately  gross  net leasehold acres  gross net productive wells and miles of pipeline gathering systems 
associated proved reserves at december  were approximately mmboe  of which was oil  including ngls  and was proved developed 
the company operates approximately of these assets  based on pv values as of december  average daily net production from the gulf of mexico was approximately mboe for the month of december the company had two rigs operating in the gulf of mexico as of december  the company s pipeline gathering systems in the gulf of mexico  including the bullwinkle platform  which serves as a processing hub for deepwater production  gather and transport production from third party fields for which the company receives production handling revenues 
permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwestern texas and southeastern new mexico and is one of the largest  most active and longest producing oil basins in the united states 
the company significantly expanded its holdings in the permian basin  specifically in the central basin platform cbp  through the acquisition of arena resources  inc arena in july the arena acquisition 
reserves and associated production in this area are predominantly oil 

table of contents the company held interests in approximately  gross  net leasehold acres in the permian basin at december   of which approximately  gross  net acres were included in the permian trust s area of mutual interest 
associated proved reserves at december  were mmboe  of which were proved developed reserves  based on estimates provided by netherland sewell and lee keeling and associates  inc lee keeling 
the company s interests in the permian basin as of december  included  gross  net producing wells with an average working interest of 
average daily net production from the company s permian basin properties was approximately mboe for the month of december the company had four rigs operating in the permian basin as of december  and drilled wells in this area during  of which were subject to the permian trust s royalty interest 
as discussed in developments above  the company completed the sale of all of its oil and natural gas properties in the permian basin  excluding assets attributable to the permian trust s area of mutual interest  in february other west texas overthrust 
the wto is an area located in pecos and terrell counties in west texas and is associated with the marathon ouachita fold and thrust belt that extends east northeast across the united states into the appalachian mountain region 
low natural gas prices continue to limit development activity in this area 
the company held interests in approximately  gross  net leasehold acres in the wto at december  the company s average daily net production in this area was approximately mboe for the month of december pursuant to a year treating agreement the company entered into with occidental petroleum corporation occidental  the company will deliver natural gas to occidental s co treatment plant in pecos county  texas the century plant  and occidental will remove co from the company s delivered natural gas production volumes 
the company will retain all methane gas after treatment 
under this agreement  the company is required to deliver certain minimum co volumes annually  and is required to compensate occidental to the extent such requirements are not met 
the company accrued million at december  for the company s shortfall in meeting its delivery obligation 
based upon projected natural gas production levels  the company expects to accrue between approximately million and million during the year ending december  for amounts related to the company s anticipated shortfall in meeting its annual delivery obligation 
due to the sensitivity of natural gas production to prevailing market prices  the company is unable to estimate additional amounts it may be required to pay under this agreement in subsequent periods 
gulf coast 
as of december   the company owned oil and natural gas interests in approximately  gross  net acres in the gulf coast area  which encompasses the coastal plain from the southernmost tip of texas through the southern portion of louisiana 
the company s average daily net production in this area was approximately mboe for the month of december proved reserves preparation of reserve estimates the estimates of oil and natural gas reserves in this report are based on reserve reports  substantially all of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
to achieve reasonable certainty  the company s engineers relied on technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
the technologies and economic data used to estimate the company s proved reserves include  but are not limited to  well logs  geological maps  seismic data  well test data  production data  historical price and cost information and property ownership interests 
this data was reviewed by various levels of management for accuracy  before consultation with independent petroleum engineers 
such consultation included review of properties  assumptions and any new data available 
internal reserves estimates and methodologies were compared to those prepared by independent petroleum engineers to test the reserves estimates and conclusions before the reserves estimates were included in this report 
the accuracy of the reserve estimates is dependent on many factors  including the following the quality and quantity of available data and the engineering and geological interpretation of that data  estimates regarding the amount and timing of future costs  which could vary considerably from actual costs  the accuracy of mandated economic assumptions such as the future price of oil and natural gas  and the judgment of the personnel preparing the estimates

table of contents technologies under sec rules  proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible  based on prices used to estimate reserves  from a given date forward from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proved effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty 
reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that have been field tested and have been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or natural gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques such as fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 
existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
in determining the amount of proved reserves  the price used must be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the reserve report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
the estimates of proved developed reserves included in the reserve report were prepared using decline curve analysis to determine the reserves of individual producing wells 
after estimating the reserves of each proved developed well  it was determined that a reasonable level of certainty exists with respect to the reserves that can be expected from close offset undeveloped wells in the field

the following estimates of proved ngl reserves are based on reserve reports as of december   substantially all of which were prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
the estimates include reserves attributable to the royalty trusts  including amounts associated with noncontrolling interest 
the pv values shown in the table below are not intended to represent the current market value of the company s estimated oil and natural gas reserves as of the dates shown 
the reserve reports were based on the company s drilling schedule and the average price during the month period ended december   and  using first day of the month prices for each month

the prices used in the company s external and internal reserve reports yield weighted average wellhead prices  which are based on index prices and adjusted for transportation and regional price differentials 
the index prices and the equivalent weighted average wellhead prices are shown in the table below 
index prices weighted average wellhead prices oil per bbl natural gas per mcf oil per bbl a natural gas per mcf december  december  december  a at december   the weighted average wellhead oil price is higher than the index price as a result of favorable location differentials for production in the gulf of mexico

table of contents prior to  ngls did not comprise a significant portion of total proved reserves and were included with oil reserves  which affects the comparability of estimated reserves in to and the company s production from the wto contains natural gas that is high in co content 
these amounts are net of co volumes that exceed pipeline quality specifications 
at december  and  estimated total proved reserves attributable to noncontrolling interests were approximately and mmboe  respectively  and standardized measure attributable to noncontrolling interests were approximately million and million  respectively 
there were no proved reserves or standardized measure attributable to noncontrolling interests at december  see note supplemental information on oil and natural gas producing activities in item of this report for additional information regarding reserve and standardized measure amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests 
pv is a non gaap financial measure and represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development and production costs  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using month average prices for the years ended december   and pv differs from standardized measure because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues 
neither pv nor standardized measure represents an estimate of fair market value of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
pv is used by the industry and by the company s management as an arbitrary reserve asset value measure to compare against past reserve bases and the reserve bases of other business entities that is not dependent on the taxpaying status of the entity 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the company s standardized measure to pv december  in millions standardized measure of discounted net cash flows present value of future income tax discounted at pv standardized measure represents the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development and production costs  and income tax expenses  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions used to calculate pv standardized measure differs from pv as standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes 
proved reserves in the mid continent  primarily the mississippian formation  increased from mmboe at december  to mmboe at december  and to mmboe at december   which comprise a significant portion of the additions to the company s proved reserves in both years 
for the company s mississippian formation development  continuity of the formation across the development area was established by reviewing electric well logs  geologically mapping the analogous reservoir and reviewing extensive production data from more than  vertical wells and a growing population of horizontal wells 
the reserves attributable to producing wells and the continuity of the formation over the development area further supports proved undeveloped classification within close proximity to the producing wells 
data from both the company and offset operators with which it has exchanged technical data demonstrate a consistency in this formation and the fluids in place over an area much larger than the development area 
in addition  direct measurement from other producing wells was also used to confirm consistency in reservoir properties such as porosity  thickness and stratigraphic conformity 
these wells all encountered proven reserves in the mississippian formation 
the proved undeveloped locations within the development area are generally parallel offsets to the horizontal wells drilled and producing to date 
during  proved reserves in the permian basin  excluding production  increased by mmboe  primarily due to extensions and discoveries associated with successful drilling in the cbp  which were slightly offset by downward revisions due mostly to pricing 
the permian basin provides access to shallow  permeable carbonate reservoirs with decades of production history and predictable production profiles 

table of contents proved undeveloped reserves

the company had three customers that individually accounted for more than of its total revenue during see note business segment information to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on its major customers 
the number of readily available purchasers for the company s products makes it unlikely that the loss of a single customer in the areas in which the company sells its products would materially affect its sales 
the company does not have any material commitments to deliver fixed and determinable quantities of oil and natural gas in the future under existing sales contracts or sales agreements 

table of contents title to properties as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  the company initially conducts a preliminary review of the title to its properties for which it does not have proved reserves 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties  the company conducts a thorough title examination and performs curative work with respect to significant defects 
to the extent drilling title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties  the company is typically responsible for curing any title defects at its expense 
the company generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until it has cured any material title defects on such property 
in addition  prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases  the company performs title reviews on the most significant leases  and depending on the materiality of properties  the company may obtain a drilling title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions 
to date  the company has obtained drilling title opinions on substantially all of its producing properties and believes that it has good and defensible title to its producing properties 
the company s oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests  liens for current taxes and other burdens  which the company believes do not materially interfere with the use of  or affect its carrying value of  the properties 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures for related to its exploration and production segment were billion  including amounts spent to develop wells in the royalty trust areas of mutual interest 
the company has budgeted approximately billion in capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  in for its exploration and production segment 
drilling and oil field services the drilling and related oil field services that the company provides to its exploration and production business and to third parties are described below 
drilling operations the company drills for its own account in northwestern oklahoma  kansas and west texas through its drilling and oil field services subsidiary  lariat 
in addition  the company also drills wells for other oil and natural gas companies  primarily in west texas 
the company believes that drilling with its own rigs allows it to control costs and maintain operating flexibility 
the company s rig fleet is designed to drill in its specific areas of operation and has an average of over horsepower and an average depth capacity of greater than  feet 
as of december   the company s drilling rig fleet consisted of operational rigs with of these rigs working on company owned properties in the mid continent and permian basin 
the company obtains its drilling contracts through either competitive bidding or direct negotiations with customers 
the company s drilling contracts generally provide for compensation on a daywork or footage basis 
contract terms offered by the company generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment used  the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and prevailing market rates 
oil field services the company s oil field services business conducts operations that  together with its drilling services  complement its exploration and production business 
oil field services include providing pulling units  trucking  rental tools  location and road construction and roustabout services to the company as well as to third parties 
customers during  the company performed approximately of its drilling and oil field services in support of its exploration and production business 
for the years ended december   and  the company generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively  for drilling and oil field services performed for third parties 
capital expenditures the company s capital expenditures for related to its drilling and oil field services were million 
the company has budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures in for its drilling and oil field services segment 

table of contents midstream services the company s midstream services segment primarily provides gathering  compression and treating services of natural gas in west texas 
the company s midstream operations and assets serve its exploration and production business as well as other oil and natural gas companies as described below 
west texas the company owns the pike s peak gas treating plant in pecos county  texas  and the grey ranch gas treating plant located in pecos county and has a interest in the partnership that leases the grey ranch plant from the company under a lease expiring in as a result of depressed natural gas prices and the treating capabilities of the recently completed century plant  these gas treating plants were used in a limited capacity during the century plant  which was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of  provides mmcf per day in available treating capacity in the west texas area 
upon substantial completion of phase i and phase ii during the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  occidental took ownership of and began operating the plant for the purpose of separating and removing co from the delivered natural gas stream 
the company diverted a majority of its high co natural gas production from its legacy gas treating plants to the century plant beginning in and throughout in  the company evaluated its gas treating plants and co 
compression facilities for impairment in connection with the operational assessment of phase i of the century plant and concluded no impairment was necessary 
the company continued to monitor the status of the century plant  the related impact on its gas treating plants and co compression facilities and natural gas prices during in the fourth quarter of  the company evaluated its gas treating plants and co compression facilities for impairment in connection with the substantial completion of phase ii of the century plant 
due to prevailing low natural gas prices  the company s natural gas production is not projected to reach the available treating capacity at the century plant 
as such  the company anticipates the use of its gas treating plants and co compression facilities in west texas will be very limited  and accordingly  recorded a million impairment on its gas treating plants and co compression facilities 
the company is party to a gas gathering agreement and an operations and maintenance agreement with pi on gathering company  llc pgc related to the company s properties located in the pi on field in west texas 
under the gas gathering agreement  the company has dedicated the pi on field acreage for priority gathering services for a period of years and will pay a fee for such services

marketing through integra energy  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary  the company buys and sells natural gas from wells it operates and wells operated by third parties within its west texas operations 
the company generally buys and sells natural gas on back to back contracts using a portfolio of baseload and spot sales agreements 
identical volumes are bought and sold on monthly and daily contracts using a combination of published pricing indices to eliminate price exposure 
the company periodically buys and sells third party natural gas 
the company conducts thorough credit checks of all potential purchasers and minimizes its exposure by contracting with multiple parties each month 
the company does not engage in any hedging activities with respect to these contracts 
the company manages several interruptible natural gas transportation agreements in order to take advantage of price differentials or to secure available markets when necessary 
the company currently has  mmbtu per day of firm transportation service subscribed on the mid continent express pipeline through march and  mmbtu per day on mid continent express pipeline through march see note commitments and contingencies to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information on the contractual fees associated with the firm transportation service 

table of contents customers during  the company performed approximately of its midstream services in support of its exploration and production business 
for the years ended december   and  the company generated revenues of million  million and million  respectively  from midstream services performed for third parties 
capital expenditures the growth of the company s midstream assets is driven by its oil and natural gas exploration and development operations 
historically  pipeline and facility expansions are made when warranted by the increase in production or the development of additional acreage 
during  the company spent million in capital expenditures to install electrical and compression infrastructure and for other general corporate purposes 
the company has budgeted approximately million in capital expenditures for its midstream services segment and for other general corporate purposes 
competition the company believes that its leasehold acreage position  drilling and oil field services businesses  midstream assets  geographic concentration of operations  vertical integration and technical and operational capabilities enable it to compete effectively with other exploration and production operations 
however  the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and the company faces competition in each of its business segments 
the company competes with major oil and natural gas companies and independent oil and natural gas companies for leases  equipment  personnel and markets for the sale of oil and natural gas 
many of these competitors are financially stronger than the company  but even financially troubled competitors can affect the market because of their need to sell oil and natural gas at any price to maintain cash flow 
certain companies may be able to pay more for producing properties and undeveloped acreage 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas prices 
the company s larger or fully integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any future federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than the company can  which would adversely affect its competitive position 
the company s ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future depends on its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because the company has fewer financial and human resources than many companies in its industry  the company may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 
oil and natural gas compete with other forms of energy available to customers  primarily based on price 
these alternate forms of energy include electricity  coal and fuel oils 
changes in the availability or price of oil and natural gas or other forms of energy  as well as business conditions  conservation  legislation  regulations and the ability to convert to alternate fuels and other forms of energy may affect the demand for oil and natural gas 
with respect to the company s drilling business  the company believes the type  age and condition of its drilling rigs  the quality of its crews and the responsiveness of its management generally enable the company to compete effectively 
however  to the extent the company drills for third parties  it encounters substantial competition from other drilling contractors 
the company s primary market area is highly competitive 
the drilling contracts for which the company competes are usually awarded on the basis of competitive bids 
the company may  based on the economic environment at the time  determine that market conditions and profit margins are such that contract drilling for third parties is not a beneficial use of its resources 
the company believes pricing and rig availability are the primary factors its potential customers consider in determining which drilling contractor to select 
while the company must be competitive in its pricing  its competitive strategy generally emphasizes the quality of its equipment and the experience of its rig crews to differentiate it from its competitors 
this strategy is less effective when demand for drilling services is weak or there is an oversupply of rigs 
these conditions usually result in increased price competition  which makes it more difficult for the company to compete on the basis of factors other than price 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technical and other resources than the company does 
their greater capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand industry downturns and better retain skilled rig personnel 
the company believes its geographic concentration of operations enables it to compete effectively in its midstream business 
most of the company s midstream assets are integrated with its production 
however  with respect to third party natural gas and acquisitions  the company competes with companies that have greater financial and personnel resources than it does 
these companies may have a greater ability to price their services below the company s prices for similar services 

table of contents seasonal nature of business generally  demand for oil and natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months 
certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer  which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit the company s drilling and producing activities and other oil and natural gas operations in a portion of its operating areas 
for example  tropical storms and hurricanes typically occur in the gulf of mexico during the summer and fall  which may require the company to evacuate personnel and shut in production until the storms subside 
these seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting the company s well drilling objectives  can delay the installation of production facilities  and can increase competition for equipment  supplies and personnel during certain times of the year  which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay the company s operations 
environmental regulations general the exploration  development and production of oil and natural gas are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal  state  tribal  regional and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection or to employee health and safety 
these laws and regulations may  among other things  require permits to conduct drilling  water withdrawal and waste disposal operations  govern the amounts and types of substances that may be disposed or released into the environment  limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities or require formal mitigation measures in sensitive areas such as wetlands  wilderness areas or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species  require investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions arising from the company s operations or attributable to former operations  impose restrictions designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous substances  and impose obligations to reclaim and abandon well sites and pits 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining operations in affected areas 
pursuant to such laws  regulations and permits  the company may be subject to operational restrictions and has made  and expects to continue to make  capital and other compliance expenditures 
increasingly  restrictions and limitations are being placed on activities that may affect the environment 
any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction  drilling  water management  completion  waste handling  storage  transport  disposal  or remediation requirements or emission or discharge limits could have a material adverse effect on the company 
moreover  accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of the company s operations  and there can be no assurance that the company will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills  including any third party claims for damage to property and natural resources or personal injury 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and employee  health and safety laws and regulations applicable to the oil and natural gas industry and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on the company 
hazardous substances and wastes the company currently owns  leases  or operates  and in the past has owned  leased  or operated  properties that have been used to explore for and produce oil and natural gas 
the company believes it has utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the applicable time  but hydrocarbons and wastes may have been disposed or released on or under the properties owned  leased  or operated by the company or on or under other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been taken for treatment or disposal 
in addition  certain of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons and wastes were not under the company s control 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra and analogous state laws 
under these laws  the company could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes  to investigate and clean up contaminated property and to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination or to pay some or all of the costs of any such action 

table of contents cercla  also known as the superfund law  and comparable state laws impose joint and several liability without regard to fault or legality of conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred and entities that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site 
under cercla  these responsible persons may be subject to strict  joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain environmental and health studies 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  natural resource damage  and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment 
cercla also authorizes the environmental protection agency epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek recovery from the responsible classes of persons the costs the third parties incur 
the company uses and generates materials in the course of its operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances 
to date  no company owned or operated site has been designated as a superfund site  and the company has not been identified as a responsible party for any superfund site 
the company also generates wastes that are subject to the requirements of rcra and comparable state statutes 
rcra imposes strict requirements on the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes 
drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  production and or development of crude oil and natural gas are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under rcra 
however  it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future 
in september  the natural resources defense council filed a petition for rulemaking with the epa requesting reconsideration of the rcra exemption for exploration  production  and development wastes 
to date  the epa has not taken any formal action on the petition 
any change in the rcra exemption for such wastes could result in an increase in costs to manage and dispose of wastes 
in the course of the company s operations  it generates petroleum hydrocarbon wastes and ordinary industrial wastes that are subject to regulation under the rcra 
the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all regulations regarding the handling and disposal of oil and natural gas wastes from its operations 
air emissions the clean air act  as amended  the outer continental shelf lands act the ocsla and comparable state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources and also impose various permitting  monitoring and reporting requirements 
these laws and regulations may require the company to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions  obtain and strictly comply with air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions 
obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects 
the company may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues as a result of such requirements 
additionally  violations of lease conditions or regulations related to air emissions can result in civil and criminal penalties  as well as potential court injunctions curtailing operations and canceling leases 
such enforcement liabilities can result from either governmental or citizen prosecution 
in august  the epa issued final regulations that established new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing  including  among other things  new source performance standards for volatile organic compounds that would apply to newly hydraulically fractured wells  existing wells that are re fractured  compressors  pneumatic controllers  storage vessels and natural gas processing plants placed in service after august however  on january   the epa made an unopposed motion in federal court to seek an abeyance of legal challenges to the regulations while it reconsiders and potentially revises portions of the new rules 
the epa has also implemented an engine emission testing program to ensure certain categories of engines  depending on the date manufactured  meet the epa emission standards 
the federal standard for engines manufactured before also requires emission testing on engines greater than horsepower and strict engine maintenance plans to be in place by october the company currently has such maintenance plans in place 

table of contents water discharges the federal water pollution act  as amended the clean water act  and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
pursuant to these laws and accompanying regulations  permits must be obtained to discharge produced waters and sand  drilling fluids  drill cuttings and other substances related to the oil and natural gas industry into onshore  coastal and offshore waters of the united states or state waters 
any such discharge of pollutants into regulated waters must be performed in accordance with the terms of the permit issued by the epa or the analogous state agency 
the clean water act and other laws  such as the ocsla  require the company to develop and implement spill response plans intended to prepare the owner of the facility to respond to a hazardous substance or oil discharge 
in addition  spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters or adjoining shorelines in the event of a spill  rupture or leak from an onshore  or offshore  facility 
the clean water act and analogous state laws also require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
the clean water act further imposes certain duties and liabilities on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in  or threatening  us waters  including the outer continental shelf or adjoining shorelines 
a liable responsible party includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility  vessel  or pipeline that is a source  or a potential threat  of an oil discharge or  in the case of offshore facilities  the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located 
the clean water act assigns joint and several strict liability  without regard to fault  to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil  natural resource damages  and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill 
although defenses exist to the liability imposed by the clean water act  they are limited 
if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur  the company may be liable for costs and damages  which costs and damages could be material to its results of operations and financial position 
the clean water act also requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
the clean water act currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of million for companies operating on the outer continental shelf  although the secretary of interior may increase this amount up to million in certain situations 
as a result of the deepwater horizon incident  legislation was introduced  but not adopted  to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility to million or more 
whether similar legislation will be introduced and adopted in the future is unknown 
if such legislation were to be adopted  this requirement could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
climate change in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of co  methane and certain other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has adopted rules that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also trigger clean air act construction and operating permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
epa s endangerment finding and ghg rules were upheld by the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit in a june decision  and a petition for review of the case by the entire dc circuit was denied in december the epa has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and processing facilities in the united states on an annual basis 
the company believes it has complied with all applicable reporting requirements to date 
however  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghg gases from  the company s equipment and operations could require it to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas it produces 
finally  to the extent increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  floods and other climatic events 
such events could have a material adverse effect on the company and potentially subject the company to further regulation 

table of contents in addition  congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and more than one half of the states have begun taking actions to control and or reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the adoption of a climate change action plan  completion of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
any future federal laws or implemented regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions could require the company to incur increased operating costs  adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that the company produces and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
endangered species the federal endangered species act the esa restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats 
the company believes its operations are in substantial compliance with the esa 
if endangered species are located in areas of the underlying properties where the company wishes to conduct seismic surveys  development activities or abandonment operations  the work could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required 
moreover  as a result of a settlement approved by the us district court for the district of columbia on september   the us fish and wildlife service is required to consider listing more than species as endangered under the esa 
under the september  settlement  the federal agency is required to make a determination on listing of the species as endangered or threatened over the six year period ending with the agency s fiscal year 
the designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause the company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on its exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on its ability to develop and produce reserves 
the company is an active participant on various agency and industry committees that are developing or addressing various epa and other federal and state agency programs to minimize potential impacts to business activity 
employee health and safety the company s operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations  including the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended osha  and comparable state statutes  whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in the company s operations and that this information be provided to employees 
pursuant to the emergency planning and community right to know act  also known as title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act  businesses that store threshold amounts of chemicals that are subject to osha s hazardous communication standard must submit information to state and local authorities in order to facilitate emergency planning and response 
that information is generally available to the public 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety 
state regulation the states in which the company operates  along with some municipalities and native american tribal areas  regulate some or all of the following activities the drilling for  and the production and gathering of  oil and natural gas  including requirements relating to drilling permits  the location  spacing and density of wells  unitization and pooling of interests  the method of drilling  casing and equipping of wells  the protection of fresh water sources  the orderly development of common sources of supply of oil and natural gas  the operation of wells  allowable rates of production  the use of fresh water in oil and natural gas operations  saltwater injection and disposal operations  the plugging and abandonment of wells and the restoration of surface properties  the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources  the protection of the correlative rights of oil and natural gas owners and  where necessary to avoid unfair  unjust or discriminatory service  the fees  terms and conditions for the gathering of natural gas 
these regulations may affect the number and location of the company s wells and the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from the company s wells  and increase the costs of the company s operations 

table of contents hydraulic fracturing oil and natural gas may be recovered from certain of the company s oil and natural gas properties through the use of hydraulic fracturing  combined with sophisticated drilling 
hydraulic fracturing  which involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production  is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
however  the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices  including the use of diesel  kerosene and similar compounds in the fracturing fluid 
in august  the epa issued final clean air act regulations governing performance standards  including for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing 
however  in january the epa submitted an unopposed motion to the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit seeking to stay legal challenges to the clean air act regulations while it reconsiders portions of the new rules 
also  federal legislation previously was introduced  but not enacted  to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in may  the bureau of land management within the us department of the interior issued a proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands  but in january it announced that it would be submitting a revised rule proposal 
that revised proposal is expected to be published in the first quarter of certain states in which the company operates  including texas  kansas and oklahoma  and municipalities therein  have adopted  or are considering adopting  regulations that have imposed  or that could impose  more stringent permitting  disclosure  disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations 
for example  in february  the railroad commission of texas implemented the fracturing disclosure rule requiring public disclosure of all the chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
local ordinances or other regulations may regulate or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted at either the state or federal level  the company s fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements  reporting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays and potential increases in costs 
these delays or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company is ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities 
in addition to asserting regulatory authority  a number of federal entities are analyzing  or have been requested to review  a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing 
in april  president obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy  information sharing and planning across federal agencies and offices regarding unconventional natural gas production  including hydraulic fracturing 
in december  the epa issued an initial progress report on a study begun in of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with a final report expected to be issued in late the epa has also announced an intent to propose by effluent limit guidelines that waste water from shale gas extraction operations must meet before going to a treatment plant  the agency also projects that it will publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the toxic substances control act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing 
additionally  a committee of the united states house of representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices  and certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources  the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing  and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency s estimates regarding natural gas reserves  including reserves from shale formations  as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 
the studies and initiatives described above  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 
the company diligently reviews best practices and industry standards  serves on industry association committees and complies with all regulatory requirements in the protection of potable water sources 
protective practices include  but are not limited to  setting multiple strings of protection pipe across the potable water sources and cementing these pipes from setting depth to surface  continuously monitoring the hydraulic fracturing process in real time and disposing of all non commercially produced fluids in certified disposal wells at depths below the potable water sources 
there have not been any incidents  citations or suits related to the company s hydraulic fracturing activities involving environmental concerns 

table of contents other regulation of the oil and natural gas industry the oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal  state  local  and regional authorities  as well as native american tribes 
legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion  frequently increasing the regulatory burden 
also  numerous departments and agencies  both federal and state  and native american tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members  some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the company s cost of doing business and  consequently  affects its profitability  these burdens generally do not affect the company any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types  quantities and locations of production 
the availability  terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas 
the interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including regulation of the terms  conditions and rates for interstate transportation  storage and various other matters  primarily by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation 
the ferc s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas 
sales of oil and natural gas are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated  congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation 
the company cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed  what proposals  if any  might actually be enacted by congress or the various state legislatures  and what effect  if any  the proposals might have on the company s operations 
drilling and production the company s operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal  state  local and native american tribal levels 
these types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
most states  and some counties  municipalities and native american tribal areas where the company operates also regulate one or more of the following activities the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the timing of construction or drilling activities  the rates of production  or allowables  the use of surface or subsurface waters  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  and the notice to surface owners and other third parties 
state laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties 
some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in some instances  forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce the company s interest in the unitized properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production 
these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which the company can drill 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 

table of contents effective october   the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre  formerly known as the minerals management service  the agency within the us department of the interior responsible for regulation of offshore energy production  was divided into two agencies  the bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee and the bureau of ocean energy management boem 
the bsee is responsible for the safety and enforcement functions of offshore oil and natural gas operations  including development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations  permitting  inspections  offshore regulatory programs  oil spill response and training and environmental compliance programs  while the functions of boem include offshore leasing  resource evaluation  national environmental policy act analysis and review and administration of oil and natural gas exploration and development plans 
under some circumstances  the boem may require any of the company s offshore federal leases to be suspended or terminated 
any such suspension or termination could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  for future hurricane seasons the boem and or the bsee may impose more stringent requirements than are already in place for the improvement of platform survivability in the gulf of mexico 
new requirements  if any  could increase the company s operating costs 
federal  state and local regulations provide detailed requirements for the abandonment of wells  closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines  and for site restoration  in areas where the company operates 
regulations of the bsee require that owners and operators plug and abandon wells and decommission and remove offshore facilities located in federal offshore lease areas in a prescribed manner 
boem requires federal leaseholders to post performance bonds or otherwise provide necessary financial assurances 
the oil conservation division of the new mexico energy  minerals and natural resources department requires the posting of financial assurance for owners and operators on privately owned or state land within new mexico in order to provide for abandonment restoration and remediation of wells 
the railroad commission of texas imposes financial assurance requirements on operators  with additional financial security required for offshore wells 
the united states army corps of engineers acoe and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment  decommissioning and site restoration 
natural gas sales and transportation historically  federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas the company produces and the manner in which the company markets its production 
ferc has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of various federal laws enacted since have resulted in the removal of all price and non price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales  which include all of the company s sales of its own production 
under the energy policy act of  ferc has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders  including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties 
ferc also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which the company may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity  which affects the marketing of natural gas that the company produces  as well as the revenues it receives for sales of its natural gas and release of its natural gas pipeline capacity 
commencing in  ferc promulgated a series of orders  regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing gas 
today  interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers  marketers and other shippers  regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with an interstate pipeline company 
ferc s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive  open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy gas directly from third party sellers other than pipelines 
however  the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated  therefore  the company cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by ferc and congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can the company determine what effect  if any  future regulatory changes might have on the company s natural gas related activities 
under ferc s current regulatory regime  transmission services must be provided on an open access  nondiscriminatory basis at cost based rates or at market based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  in the past ferc has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase the company s cost of transporting gas to point of sale locations 

table of contents employees as of december   the company had  full time employees  including more than geologists  geophysicists  petroleum engineers  technicians  land and regulatory professionals 
of the company s  employees  were located at the company s headquarters in oklahoma city  oklahoma at december   and the remaining employees work in the company s various field offices and drilling sites 

table of contents glossary of oil and natural gas terms the following is a description of the meanings of certain oil and natural gas industry terms used in this report

to the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities  their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration  development or production costs  as appropriate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of capitalized acquisition  exploration  and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production lifting costs identified above 
productive well 
a well that is found to be capable of producing oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well 
prospect 
a specific geographic area that  based on supporting geological  geophysical or other data and also preliminary economic analysis using reasonably anticipated prices and costs  is deemed to have potential for the discovery of commercial hydrocarbons 
proved developed reserves 
reserves that are both proved and developed 
proved oil and natural gas reserves 
has the meaning given to such term in rule a of regulation s x  which defines proved reserves as those quantities of oil and natural gas which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations  prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for estimation 
the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time 
the area of a reservoir considered proved includes i the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts  if any  and ii adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can  with reasonable certainty  be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data 
in the absence of data on fluid contacts  proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish a lower contact with reasonable certainty 
where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap  proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience  engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty 
reserves that can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including  but not limited to  fluid injection are included in the proved classification when i successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole  the operation of an installed program in the reservoir  or an analogous reservoir  or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and ii the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities  including governmental entities 

table of contents existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined 
the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report  determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within such period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  excluding escalations based upon future conditions 
proved undeveloped reserves 
reserves that are both proved and undeveloped 
pulling units 
pulling units are used in connection with completions and workover operations 
pv see present value of future net revenues above 
rental tools 
a variety of rental tools and equipment  ranging from trash trailers to blowout preventers to sand separators  for use in the oil field 
reserves 
estimated remaining quantities of oil and natural gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible by application of development projects to known accumulations 
in addition  there must exist  or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist  the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production  installed means of delivering oil and natural gas or related substances to market  and all permits and financing required to implement the project 
reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major  potentially sealing  faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible 
reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a non productive reservoir ie  absence of reservoir  structurally low reservoir  or negative test results 
such areas may contain prospective resources ie  potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations 
reservoir

the present value of estimated future cash inflows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  less future development and production costs and future income tax expenses  discounted at per annum to reflect timing of future cash flows and using the same pricing assumptions as were used to calculate pv standardized measure differs from pv because standardized measure includes the effect of future income taxes on future net revenues 
trucking 
the provision of trucks to move the company s drilling rigs from one well location to another and to deliver water and equipment to the field 
undeveloped acreage 
lease acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or natural gas regardless of whether such acreage contains proved reserves 
undeveloped oil and natural gas reserves 
reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion 
i reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled  unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances 
ii undrilled locations are classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years  unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time 
iii under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated  unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty 
working interest 
the operating interest that gives the owner the right to drill  produce and conduct operating activities on the property and receive a share of production and requires the owner to pay a share of the costs of drilling and production operations 

table of contents item a 
risk factors drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the company s drilling and operating activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that the company will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil and natural gas can be unprofitable if dry wells are drilled and if productive wells do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
decisions to develop properties depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
the estimated cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
in addition  the company s drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of various factors  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting  unusual or unexpected geological formations and miscalculations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  shortages of or delays in obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations  equipment malfunctions  failures or accidents  lack of available gathering facilities or delays in construction of gathering facilities  lack of available capacity on interconnecting transmission pipelines  lack of adequate electrical infrastructure  unexpected operational events and drilling conditions  pipe or cement failures and casing collapses  pressures  fires  blowouts and explosions  lost or damaged drilling and service tools  loss of drilling fluid circulation  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  water or drilling fluids  natural disasters  environmental hazards  such as oil and natural gas leaks  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases or well fluids  adverse weather conditions such as extreme cold  fires caused by extreme heat or lack of rain  and severe storms  tornadoes or hurricanes  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  unique risks associated with offshore operations  such as potential oil spills and increased regulation  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
any of these risks can cause substantial losses  including personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  environmental contamination or loss of wells and regulatory fines or penalties 

table of contents oil and natural gas prices fluctuate due to a number of factors that are beyond the company s control  and a decline in oil and natural gas prices could significantly affect the company s financial results and impede its growth 
the company s revenues  profitability and cash flow are highly dependent upon the prices it realizes from the sale of oil and natural gas 
the markets for these commodities are very volatile 
oil and natural gas prices can fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  among others regional  domestic and foreign supply of  and demand for  oil and natural gas  as well as perceptions of supply of  and demand for  oil and natural gas  the price and quantity of foreign imports  us and worldwide political and economic conditions  weather conditions and seasonal trends  anticipated future prices of oil and natural gas  alternative fuels and other commodities  technological advances affecting energy consumption and energy supply  the proximity  capacity  cost and availability of pipeline infrastructure  treating  transportation and refining capacity  natural disasters and other acts of force majeure  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  energy conservation and environmental measures  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
for oil  from january  through december   the highest monthly nymex settled price was per bbl and the lowest was per bbl 
for natural gas  from january  through december   the highest monthly nymex settled price was per mmbtu and the lowest was per mmbtu 
in addition  the market price of oil and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months than during other months of the year due to increased demand for oil and natural gas for heating purposes during the winter season 
lower oil and natural gas prices may not only decrease the company s revenues on a per share basis  but also may ultimately reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that it can produce economically and  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
this also may result in the company having to make substantial downward adjustments to its estimated proved reserves 
future price declines may result in further reductions of the asset carrying values of the company s oil and natural gas properties 
the company utilizes the full cost method of accounting for costs related to its oil and natural gas properties 
under this accounting method  all costs for both productive and nonproductive properties are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the unit of production method 
however  the amount of these costs that can be carried as capitalized assets is subject to a ceiling  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to proved properties  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or market value of unevaluated properties 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using the most recent month average prices for oil and natural gas  adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges 
in the event any of the company s derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges  the impact of these derivative contracts will be included in the determination of the company s full cost ceiling 
the company had no full cost ceiling impairments during the years ended december   or and cumulative full cost ceiling limitation impairment charges of billion at both december  and future declines in oil and natural gas prices  without other mitigating circumstances  could result in additional losses of future net revenues  including losses attributable to quantities that cannot be economically produced at lower prices  which could cause the company to record additional write downs of capitalized costs of its oil and natural gas properties and non cash charges against future earnings 
the amount of such future write downs and non cash charges could be substantial 

table of contents the company has a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations and commitments  which may adversely affect its cash flow and its ability to operate its business 
as of december   the company s total indebtedness was billion and the company had preferred stock outstanding with an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
the company s substantial level of indebtedness and the dividends associated with its outstanding preferred stock increases the possibility that it may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of the company s indebtedness and or the preferred stock dividends 
the company s indebtedness and outstanding preferred stock  combined with its lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments  such as its obligations to drill development wells for the royalty trusts  could have other important consequences to the company 
for example  it could make the company more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to payments on its indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of the company s cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit the company s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in its business and the industry in which it operates  place the company at a disadvantage compared to its competitors that are less leveraged and  therefore  may be able to take advantage of opportunities that the company s indebtedness prevents it from pursuing  and limit the company s ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of its business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
the company s current estimates of reserves could change  potentially in material amounts  in the future 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise  requiring interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to production rates and economic factors such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  the assumed effect of governmental regulation and availability of funds for development expenditures 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
see business business segments and primary operations in item of this report for information about the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary and could vary significantly from the company s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report  which in turn could have a negative effect on the value of the company s assets 
in addition  from time to time in the future  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves  potentially in material amounts  to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 

table of contents the present value of future net cash flows from the company s proved reserves calculated in accordance with sec guidelines will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of its estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
the company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on month average prices and costs 
actual future net cash flows from the company s oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices the company receives for oil and natural gas  the accuracy of the company s reserve estimates  the actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulation or taxation 
the timing of both the company s production and its incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the company uses a discount factor when calculating discounted future net cash flows  which may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with the company or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
unless the company replaces its oil and natural gas reserves  its reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore its cash flow and income  are highly dependent on its success in efficiently developing and exploiting its current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
the company may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace its current and future production at acceptable costs  which could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company will not know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically producible 
the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area does not enable the company to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in sufficient quantities to be economically viable 
even if sufficient amounts of oil or natural gas exist  the company may damage the potentially productive hydrocarbon bearing formation or experience mechanical difficulties while drilling or completing the well  resulting in a reduction in production from the well or abandonment of the well 
during  the company completed a total of  gross wells  of which three were identified as dry wells 
if the company drills additional wells that it identifies as dry wells in its current and future prospects  its drilling success rate may decline and materially harm its business 
in summary  the cost of drilling  completing and operating any well is often uncertain  and new wells may not be productive 
production of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe or unseasonable weather 
production of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids could be materially and adversely affected by natural disasters or severe weather 
repercussions of natural disasters or severe weather conditions may include evacuation of personnel and curtailment of operations  damage to drilling rigs or other facilities  resulting in suspension of operations  inability to deliver materials to worksites  and damage to  or shutting in of  pipelines and other transportation facilities 
in addition  the company s hydraulic fracturing operations require significant quantities of water 
regions in which the company operates have recently experienced drought conditions 
any diminished access to water for use in hydraulic fracturing  whether due to usage restrictions or drought or other weather conditions  could curtail the company s operations or otherwise result in delays in operations or increased costs 

table of contents volatility in the capital markets could affect the company s ability to obtain capital  cause it to incur additional financing expense or affect the value of certain assets 
in recent periods  global financial markets and economic conditions have been volatile due to multiple factors  including significant write offs in the financial services sector and weak economic conditions 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial and or operating strength 
due to this volatility  for many companies the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has been greater in recent periods than has historically been the case 
continued market volatility may from time to time adversely affect the company s ability to access capital and credit markets or to obtain funds at low interest rates or on other advantageous terms 
these factors may adversely affect the company s business  results of operations or liquidity 
these factors may also adversely affect the value of certain of the company s assets and its ability to draw on its senior credit facility 
adverse credit and capital market conditions may require the company to reduce the carrying value of assets associated with derivative contracts to account for non performance by  or increased credit risk from  counterparties to those contracts 
if financial institutions that have extended credit commitments to the company are adversely affected by volatile conditions of the united states and international capital markets  they may become unable to fund borrowings under their credit commitments to the company  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and its ability to borrow additional funds  if needed  for working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate purposes 
properties that the company buys may not produce as projected  and the company may be unable to determine reserve potential  identify liabilities associated with the properties or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the company s initial technical reviews of properties it acquires are necessarily limited because an in depth review of every individual property involved in each acquisition generally is not feasible 
even a detailed review of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor will it permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
inspections may not always be performed on every well and environmental problems  such as soil or ground water contamination  are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the company may assume certain environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties  and such risks and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
the development of the company s proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than the company currently anticipates 
as of december   of the company s total reserves were proved undeveloped reserves 
development of these reserves may take longer and require higher levels of capital expenditures than the company currently anticipates 
therefore  ultimate recoveries from these fields may not match current expectations 
delays in the development of the company s reserves or increases in costs to drill and develop such reserves will reduce the pv value of the company s estimated proved undeveloped reserves and future net revenues estimated for such reserves 
a significant portion of the company s operations are located in northwest oklahoma  kansas and the gulf of mexico  making it vulnerable to risks associated with operating in a limited number of major geographic areas 
as of december   excluding reserves and production related to the permian properties sold in february  approximately of the company s proved reserves and approximately of its production was located in the mid continent and gulf of mexico 
this concentration could disproportionately expose the company to operational and regulatory risk in these areas 
this relative lack of diversification in location of its key operations could expose the company to adverse developments in these areas or the oil and natural gas markets  including  for example  transportation or treatment capacity constraints  curtailment of production or treatment plant closures for scheduled maintenance 
these factors could have a significantly greater impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows than if the company s properties were more diversified 

table of contents the company s development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and the company may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
the company makes substantial capital expenditures in its business and operations for the exploration  development  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  the company has financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from asset sales and from the sale of equity and debt securities and cash generated by operations 
the company expects to finance its future capital expenditures with the sale of equity and debt securities  cash flow from operations  asset sales and other financing arrangements 
the company s cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including the company s proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas it is able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and the company s ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if the company s revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  lower production  declines in reserves or for any other reason  the company may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain its operations at current levels 
in order to fund the company s capital expenditures  it may seek additional financing 
however  the company s senior credit facility contains covenants limiting its ability to incur additional indebtedness  and the company s lenders may withhold their consent to exceed the limitations in such covenants at their sole discretion 
the company s senior note indentures also contain covenants that may restrict the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness if it does not satisfy certain financial metrics 
if the company is unable to obtain additional financing  it may be necessary for the company to reduce or suspend its capital expenditures 
disruptions in the global financial and capital markets also could adversely affect the company s ability to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of the company s operations relating to exploration and development of its prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in the company s oil and natural gas reserves 
the agreements governing the company s existing indebtedness have restrictions  financial covenants and borrowing base redeterminations which could adversely affect its operations 
the company s senior credit facility and the indentures governing its senior notes restrict its ability to  among other things  obtain additional financing  make investments  lease equipment  sell assets and engage in business combinations 
the senior credit facility also requires the company to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
the company s ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and could be affected by the levels of cash flow from the company s operations and events or circumstances beyond its control 
declining commodity prices could adversely affect the company s ability to comply with such restrictions and covenants 
the company s failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the senior credit facility  senior notes or other debt financings could result in a default under those instruments  which could cause all of its existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
the company s senior credit facility limits the amounts it can borrow to a borrowing base amount 
the borrowing base is subject to review semi annually  however  the lenders reserve the right to have one additional re determination of the borrowing base per calendar year 
unscheduled re determinations may be made at the company s request  but are limited to two requests per year 
borrowing base determinations are based upon proved developed producing reserves  proved developed non producing reserves and proved undeveloped reserves 
outstanding borrowings exceeding the borrowing base must be repaid promptly  or the company must pledge other oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral 
the company may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments under the senior credit facility  which are required  for example  when the committed line of credit is exceeded  proceeds of asset sales in new oil and natural gas properties are not reinvested  or indebtedness that is not permitted by the terms of the senior credit facility is incurred 
if the indebtedness under the company s senior credit facility and senior notes were to be accelerated  the company s assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness in full 

table of contents the company s derivative activities could result in financial losses and could reduce its earnings 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  the company currently has entered  and may in the future enter  into derivative contracts for a portion of its future oil and natural gas production  including fixed price swaps  collars and basis swaps 
the company has not designated and does not plan to designate any of its derivative contracts as hedges for accounting purposes and  as a result  records all derivative contracts on its balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized in current period earnings 
accordingly  the company s earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in the fair value of its derivative contracts 
derivative contracts also expose the company to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the derivative contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative contract and actual prices received 
in addition  these types of derivative contracts can limit the benefit the company would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
the company s drilling and services revenues are dependent on the needs of other companies in the oil and natural gas industry 
companies to which the company provides drilling and related services are affected by the oil and natural gas industry risks mentioned above 
market prices of oil and natural gas  limited access to capital and reductions in capital expenditures could result in oil and natural gas companies canceling or curtailing their drilling programs  which could reduce the demand for the company s drilling and related services 
any prolonged reduction in the overall level of exploration and development activities  whether resulting from changes in oil and natural gas prices or otherwise  could impact the company s drilling and services segment by negatively affecting revenues  cash flow and profitability  the company s ability to retain skilled rig personnel whom it would need in the event of an upturn in the demand for drilling and related services  and the fair value of the company s rig fleet 
oil and natural gas wells are subject to operational hazards that can cause substantial losses for which the company may not be adequately insured 
there are a variety of operating risks inherent in oil and natural gas production and associated activities  such as fires  leaks  explosions  mechanical problems  major equipment failures  blowouts  uncontrollable flow of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids  water or drilling fluids  casing collapses  abnormally pressurized formations and natural disasters 
the occurrence of any of these or similar accidents that temporarily or permanently halt the production and sale of oil and natural gas at any of the company s properties could have a material adverse impact on its business activities  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  if any of such risks or similar accidents occur  the company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  regulatory investigation and penalties and environmental damage and clean up responsibility 
if the company experiences any of these problems  its ability to conduct operations could be adversely affected 
while the company maintains insurance coverage that it deems appropriate for these risks  its operations may result in liabilities exceeding such insurance coverage or liabilities not covered by insurance 
shortages or increases in costs of equipment  services and qualified personnel could adversely affect the company s ability to execute its exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within its budget 
the demand for qualified and experienced personnel to conduct field operations  geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices  causing periodic shortages 
historically  there have been shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment as demand for rigs and equipment has increased along with the number of wells being drilled 
these factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment  services and personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate demand and result in increased prices for drilling rigs  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
shortages of field personnel and equipment or price increases could significantly affect the company s ability to execute its exploration and development plans as projected 

table of contents market conditions or operational impediments may hinder the company s access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production of oil and natural gas 
market conditions or a lack of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder the company s access to oil and natural gas markets or delay production of oil and natural gas 
the availability of a ready market for the company s oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
the company s ability to market its production depends  in substantial part  on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and treating facilities 
the company s failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms in the future or to expand its midstream assets could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company may be required to shut in wells for a lack of a market or because access to natural gas pipelines  gathering system capacity or treating facilities may be limited or unavailable 
the company would be unable to realize revenue from any shut in wells until production arrangements were made to deliver the production to market 
competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect the company s ability to succeed 
the oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive  and the company competes with many companies that have greater resources than it does 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas  but also conduct refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional  national or worldwide basis 
these companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or identify  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than the company s financial or human resources permit 
in addition  these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices 
the company s larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal  state  local and other laws and regulations more easily than it can  which would adversely affect its competitive position 
the company s ability to acquire additional properties and to identify reserves in the future will depend upon its ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  because the company has fewer financial and human resources than many companies in its industry  it may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties 
downturns in oil and natural gas prices can result in decreased oil field activity which  in turn  can result in an oversupply of service providers and drilling rigs 
this oversupply can result in severe reductions in prices received for oil field services or a complete lack of work for crews and equipment 
the company s use of d and d seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas 
in addition  the use of such technology requires greater predrilling expenditures  which could adversely affect the results of the company s drilling operations 
a significant aspect of the company s exploration and development plan involves seismic data 
even when properly used and interpreted  d and d seismic data and visualization techniques are only tools used to assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators and do not enable the interpreter to know whether hydrocarbons are present in those structures 
other geologists and petroleum professionals  when studying the same seismic data  may have significantly different interpretations than the company s professionals 
in addition  the use of d and d seismic and other advanced technologies requires greater predrilling expenditures than traditional drilling strategies  and the company could incur losses due to such expenditures 
as a result  the company s drilling activities may not be geologically successful or economical  and its overall drilling success rate or its drilling success rate for activities in a particular area may not improve 
the company may often gather d and d seismic data over large areas 
the company s interpretation of seismic data delineates for it those portions of an area that it believes are desirable for drilling 
therefore  the company may choose not to acquire option or lease rights prior to acquiring seismic data  and in many cases  the company may identify hydrocarbon indicators before seeking option or lease rights in the location 
if the company is not able to lease those locations on acceptable terms  it will have made substantial expenditures to acquire and analyze d and d seismic data without having an opportunity to attempt to benefit from those expenditures 

table of contents many of the company s prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content  which can negatively affect its economics 
the reservoirs of many of the company s prospects in the wto may contain natural gas that is high in co content 
the natural gas produced from these reservoirs must be treated for the removal of co prior to marketing 
if the company cannot obtain sufficient capacity at treatment facilities for its natural gas with a high co concentration  or if the cost to obtain such capacity significantly increases  the company could be forced to delay production and development or experience increased production costs 
the company sometimes encounters co levels in its wells that are higher than expected 
since the treatment expenses are incurred on an mcf basis  the company will incur a higher effective treating cost per mmbtu of natural gas sold for natural gas with a higher co content 
as a result  high co gas wells must produce at much higher rates than low co gas wells to be economic  especially in a low natural gas price environment 
furthermore  when the company treats the gas for the removal of co  some of the methane is used to run the treatment plant as fuel gas and other methane and heavier hydrocarbons  such as ethane  propane and butane  cannot be separated from the co and is lost 
this is known as plant shrink 
during  the company s plant shrink has been approximately in the wto 
after giving effect to plant shrink  as many as mcf of high co natural gas must be produced to sell one mmbtu of natural gas 
the company reports its volumes of natural gas reserves and production net of co volumes that are removed prior to sales 
low levels of natural gas production in the wto  due to declines in production from existing wells  depressed commodity prices or otherwise  currently adversely affect  and could in the future adversely affect  the company s ability to satisfy certain contractual obligations and revenues and cash flow from its midstream services segment 
the company has entered into long term gas gathering agreements with each of pgc and occidental 
these agreements require the company to annually deliver certain minimum volumes of natural gas to pgc through june  and co to occidental through december  and to compensate pgc and occidental to the extent it does not satisfy the contractual delivery requirements 
a material decrease in production in the wto  where the applicable natural gas assets are located  has resulted in  and may continue to result in  a decline in the volume of natural gas and co delivered to pgc and occidental  respectively  and to its own pipelines and facilities for gathering  transporting and treating 
the company has no control over many factors affecting production activity in the wto  including prevailing and projected natural gas prices  demand for hydrocarbons  the level of reserves  geological considerations  governmental regulation and the availability and cost of capital 
as a consequence of these factors  the company has not produced and delivered  and may continue to not produce and deliver  sufficient quantities of natural gas or co to meet its contractual delivery obligations 
the company is required to compensate pgc and occidental for shortfalls in its contractual delivery obligations 
the company accrued million at december  for its shortfalls under its contract with occidental and expects to accrue between approximately million and million during the year ending december  for amounts related to the company s anticipated shortfall in meeting its annual delivery obligations based on current projected natural gas production levels 
in future years  amounts payable to pgc and or occidental for such shortfalls could be material 
in addition  if the company fails to connect new wells to its gathering systems  the amount of natural gas it gathers  transports and treats will decline substantially over time and could  upon exhaustion of the current wells  cause the company to abandon its gathering systems and  possibly cease gathering  transporting and treating operations 

table of contents the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of its acquisitions of dynamic and other properties in the gulf of mexico or other future acquisitions  and integration of acquisitions may disrupt the company s business and management 
the company acquired dynamic and other properties in the gulf of mexico in the second quarter of  and it may acquire other companies or large asset packages in the future as it has done in the past 
the company may not realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or other future acquisitions  and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of the company s ongoing business and distraction of its management and employees from other opportunities and challenges  difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information systems  human resources and other administrative systems  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  inability to take advantage of anticipated tax benefits  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant problems  liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business  exposure to litigation and other potential liabilities in connection with environmental laws regulating exploration and production activities related to entities that the company acquires  or that were previously acquired by such entities  exposure to litigation or other claims in connection with  or inheritance of claims or litigation risk as a result of  an acquisition  including but not limited to  claims from terminated employees  customers  former stockholders or other third parties  potential inability to assert that internal control over financial reporting is effective  and potential incompatibility of business cultures 
offshore operations involve special risks that could adversely affect operations 
offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
any liabilities incurred by the company with respect to such risks could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or leasehold acquisitions or result in loss of equipment and properties 
in addition  an oil spill on or related to offshore properties and operations could expose the company to joint and several strict liability  without regard to fault  under applicable law for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil  natural resource damages  and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill 
if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur  the company may be liable for costs and damages that could be material to its business  financial condition or results of operations 
reserves associated with properties in the gulf of mexico will have relatively short production periods or reserve lives 
high production rates generally result in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the gulf of mexico during the initial few years when compared to other regions in the united states 
due to high initial production rates  production of reserves from reservoirs in the gulf of mexico generally decline more rapidly than from other producing reservoirs 
as a result  the company s reserve replacement needs from new prospects in the gulf of mexico may be greater than reserve replacement needs for other properties with longer life reserves in other producing areas 
also  expected revenue and return on capital for gulf of mexico properties will depend on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods 

table of contents the company may record significant estimates of future asset retirement obligations and such estimates may vary from period to period due to its operations in the gulf of mexico 
the company is required to record a liability for the present value of asset retirement obligations to plug and abandon inactive  non producing wells  to remove inactive or damaged platforms  facilities and equipment  and to restore the land or seabed at the end of oil and natural gas production operations 
these costs are typically considerably more expensive for offshore operations as compared to most land based operations  due to the logistical issues associated with working in waters of various depths and increased regulatory scrutiny 
estimating future restoration and removal costs in the gulf of mexico is especially difficult because most of the removal obligations may be many years in the future  regulatory requirements are subject to change or more restrictive interpretation  and asset removal technologies are constantly evolving  which may result in additional or increased costs 
as a result  the company s acquisitions of offshore properties in may require the company to make significant increases or decreases to estimated asset retirement obligations in future periods 
for example  the company s platforms  facilities and equipment in the gulf of mexico are subject to damage or destruction as a result of hurricanes 
the estimated cost to plug and abandon a well or dismantle a platform can change dramatically if the host platform from which the work was anticipated to be performed is damaged or toppled  rather than structurally intact 
accordingly  the company s increased operations in the gulf of mexico could cause its estimates of future asset retirement obligations to differ dramatically from what it may ultimately incur as a result of damage from a hurricane 
insurance may not protect the company against business and operating risks associated with its properties in the gulf of mexico 
the company maintains insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with its offshore properties 
for some risks  the company may not obtain insurance if it believes the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
due to market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance policies are economically unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 
although the company will maintain insurance at levels it believes are appropriate and consistent with industry practice  it will not be fully insured against all risks  including high cost business interruption insurance and drilling and completion risks that are generally not recoverable from third parties or insurance 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
losses and liabilities from uninsured and underinsured events and delay in the payment of insurance proceeds could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
insurance costs have generally risen in recent years due to a number of catastrophic events  including hurricanes ivan  katrina  rita  gustav and ike  the deepwater horizon incident  the september  terrorist attacks and the japanese tsunami 
the offshore oil and natural gas industry suffered extensive damage from the previously mentioned hurricanes and  as a result  insurance costs related to offshore oil and gas operations have increased significantly compared to the cost of insuring onshore oil and gas production 
insurers are requiring higher retention levels and limit the amount of insurance proceeds that are available after a major windstorm in the event that damages are incurred 
if storm activity in the future is as severe as it was in or  insurance underwriters may no longer insure gulf of mexico assets against weather related damage 
in addition  the company does not have in place  and does not intend to put in place  business interruption insurance due to its high cost 
if an accident or other event results in damage to offshore operations  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  and such damage is not fully covered by insurance or a recoverable indemnity from a vendor  it could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  the company may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers reasonable or be able to obtain insurance against certain risks 

table of contents the company is subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting its operations or expose it to significant liabilities 
the company s oil and natural gas exploration  production  transportation and treatment operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct its operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  the company must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental authorities 
the company may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations 
further  in light of the explosion and fire on the drilling rig deepwater horizon in the gulf of mexico  as well as recent incidents involving the release of oil and natural gas and fluids as a result of drilling activities in the united states  there have been a variety of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels to restrict oil and natural gas drilling operations in certain locations 
any increased regulation or suspension of oil and natural gas exploration and production  or revision or reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations  that arises out of these incidents or otherwise could result in delays and higher operating costs 
such costs or significant delays could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company must also comply with laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and market manipulations in energy markets 
to the extent the company is a shipper on interstate pipelines  it must comply with the tariffs of such pipelines and with federal policies related to the use of interstate capacity 
laws and regulations governing oil and natural gas exploration and production may also affect production levels 
the company is required to comply with federal and state laws and regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions related to the unitization or pooling of the oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum rates of production from wells  the spacing of wells  and the plugging and abandonment of wells 
these and other laws and regulations can limit the amount of oil and natural gas the company can produce from its wells  limit the number of wells it can drill  or limit the locations at which it can conduct drilling operations 
new laws or regulations  or changes to existing laws or regulations  may unfavorably impact the company  could result in increased operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
for example  congress has recently considered  and may continue to consider  legislation that  if adopted in its proposed form  would subject companies involved in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities to  among other items  additional regulation of and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing of wells  and the elimination of most us federal tax incentives and certain deductions available to oil and natural gas exploration and production activities 
in addition  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank act and rules promulgated thereunder could reduce trading positions in the energy futures or swaps markets and materially reduce hedging opportunities for the company  which could adversely affect its revenues and cash flows during periods of low commodity prices  and which could adversely affect the company s ability to restructure its hedges when it might be desirable to do so 
additionally  state and federal regulatory authorities may expand or alter applicable pipeline safety laws and regulations  compliance with which may increase capital costs for the company and third party downstream oil and natural gas transporters 
these and other potential regulations could increase the company s operating costs  reduce its liquidity  delay its operations  increase direct and third party post production costs or otherwise alter the way the company conducts its business  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows and which could reduce cash received by or available for distribution  including any amounts paid by the company for transportation on downstream interstate pipelines 
the company s operations in the gulf of mexico may face broad adverse consequences resulting from increased regulation of offshore drilling operations as a result of the deepwater horizon incident  some of which may be unforeseeable 
the april explosion and fire on the drilling rig deepwater horizon and resulting major oil spill produced significant economic  environmental and natural resource damage in the gulf coast region 
in response to the explosion and spill  there have been many proposals by governmental and private constituencies to address the direct impact of the disaster and to prevent similar disasters in the future 
the boemre formerly known as the minerals management service  the agency within the us department of interior formerly responsible for regulation of offshore energy production  issued a series of notices to lessees and operators ntls  which imposed a variety of new safety measures and permitting requirements  and implemented a temporary moratorium on deepwater drilling activities in the gulf of mexico that effectively shut down deepwater drilling activities for six months in despite the fact that the drilling moratorium was lifted  this spill and its aftermath have led to delays in obtaining drilling permits 
the company must interact with both the boem and the bsee  which assumed the responsibilities of boemre on october   to obtain approval of exploration and development plans and issuance of drilling permits for the company s properties in the gulf of mexico  which may result in added plan approval or drilling permit delays 
while federal legislation previously was introduced to expedite the process for obtaining offshore permits that include limitations on the time frame for environmental and judicial review  there is no guarantee that this or similar legislation will be enacted 

table of contents in addition to the drilling restrictions  new safety measures and permitting requirement  there have been numerous additional proposed changes in laws  regulations  guidance and policy in response to the deepwater horizon explosion and oil spill that could affect offshore operations and cause the company to incur substantial losses or expenditures 
implementation of any one or more of the various proposed responses to the disaster could materially adversely affect operations in the gulf of mexico by raising operating costs  increasing insurance premiums  delaying drilling operations and increasing regulatory costs and  further  could lead to a wide variety of other unforeseeable consequences that could make operations in the gulf of mexico more difficult  time consuming and costly 
new regulatory requirements could significantly delay the company s ability to obtain permits to drill new wells in offshore waters 
following the deepwater horizon incident  the boemre issued a series of ntls and other regulatory requirements imposing new standards and permitting procedures for new wells to be drilled in federal waters of the outer continental shelf 
these requirements include the following the environmental ntl  which imposes new and more stringent requirements for documenting the environmental impacts potentially associated with the drilling of a new offshore well and significantly increases documentation requirements regarding the ability to respond to oil spills 
the statement of compliance ntl  which imposes requirements for operators regarding well design  construction and flow intervention processes and demonstration of adequate resources to respond to and contain spills  and also requires certifications of compliance from senior corporate officers 
the drilling safety rule  which prescribes tighter cementing and casing practices  imposes standards for the use of drilling fluids to maintain wellbore integrity  and stiffens oversight requirements relating to blowout preventers and their components  including shear and pipe rams 
the workplace safety rule  which requires operators to have a comprehensive safety and environmental management system sems in order to reduce human and organizational errors as root causes of work related accidents and offshore spills 
in its current form  the rule requires a company s sems to be audited by an independent third party auditor or internal audit team who has been pre approved by the agency to perform the auditing task 
bsee has also drafted a statement of policy announcing its expectation that all organizations and individuals working in outer continental shelf waters should establish and maintain a positive safety culture commensurate with the significance of their activities and the nature and complexity of their organizations and functions 
as a result of the issuance of these new regulatory requirements  bsee has been taking much longer than the minerals management service and boemre did in the past to review and approve permits for drilling operations 
as a result  the company may encounter increased costs associated with regulatory compliance and delays in obtaining permits for other operations such as recompletions  workovers and abandonment activities 
the company is unsure what long term effect  if any  additional regulatory requirements and permitting procedures will have on offshore operations 
the company may become subject to a variety of unforeseen adverse consequences arising directly or indirectly from the deepwater horizon incident 
new regulatory requirements could have a significant impact on the company s estimates of future asset retirement obligations from period to period 
the company is responsible for plugging and abandoning wellbores and decommissioning associated platforms  pipelines and facilities on its acquired oil and natural gas properties 
in addition to the ntls discussed in the above risk factors  the boemre issued an ntl that became effective in october  which established more stringent requirements for the timely decommissioning of wells  platforms and pipelines that are no longer producing or serving exploration or support functions related to an operator s lease in the gulf of mexico 
this ntl requires that any well that has not been used during the past five years for exploration or production or any infrastructure to support these operations on an active lease and is no longer capable of producing in paying quantities must be permanently plugged or temporarily abandoned within three years 
plugging or abandonment of wells may be delayed by two years if all of the well s hydrocarbon and sulphur zones are appropriately isolated 
similarly  platforms or other facilities that are no longer useful for operations because they have been toppled or destroyed or have not been used in the past five years for exploration  production or for infrastructure to support such operation must be removed within five years 
these regulations affecting plugging  abandonment and removal activities may increase  perhaps materially  the future plugging  abandonment and removal costs associated with the company s offshore properties  which may translate into a need to increase the estimate of future asset retirement obligations required to meet such increased costs 
moreover  implementation of this ntl could likely result in increased demand for salvage contractors and equipment  resulting in increased estimates of plugging  abandonment and removal costs and increases in related asset retirement obligations 

table of contents the company s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting operations or result in significant costs and liabilities 
the company s oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and comprehensive federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations that are applicable to operations  including the acquisition of a permit before conducting drilling  water withdrawal or waste disposal activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  the limitation or prohibition of drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the imposition of regulations designed to protect employees from exposure to hazardous substances  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations 
numerous governmental authorities  such as the epa and analogous state agencies  have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them  often requiring difficult and costly actions 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in litigation  the assessment of administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of the company s operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of the company s operations due to its handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to its operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  the company could be subject to joint and several strict liability for the investigation  removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether it was responsible for the release or contamination or whether the operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which the company s wells are drilled and facilities where its petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance  as well as to seek damages for contamination even in the absence of non compliance  with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury  natural resources damage or property damage 
in addition  the risk of accidental spills or releases could expose the company to significant liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
certain laws related to oil spills impose joint and several strict liability  without regard to fault  for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including  but not limited to  the costs of responding to a release of oil  natural resource damages  and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill 
although defenses exist to the liability imposed by those laws  they are limited 
if an oil discharge or substantial threat of discharge were to occur  the company may be liable for costs and damages  which costs and damages could be material to its results of operations and financial position 
further  certain laws require owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill 
as a result of the deepwater horizon incident  legislation was introduced  but not adopted  to increase the minimum level of financial responsibility 
whether similar legislation will be introduced and adopted in the future is unknown 
if such legislation were to be adopted  the requirement could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly construction  drilling  water management  completion  waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require significant expenditures by the company to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
the company may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance 
as a result of any increased cost of compliance  the company may decide to discontinue drilling 

table of contents federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives as well as governmental reviews relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays as well as adversely affect the company s level of production 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations  such as shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions  however  the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices  including the use of diesel  kerosene and similar compounds in fracturing fluid 
in august  the epa issued final clean air act regulations governing performance standards  including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing 
however  in january the epa submitted an unopposed motion to the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit seeking to stay legal challenges to the clean air act regulations while the epa reconsiders portions of the new rules 
also  legislation has been introduced  but not enacted  in congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process 
in may  the bureau of land management within the us department of the interior issued a proposed rule containing disclosure requirements and other mandates for hydraulic fracturing on federal lands  but in january it announced that it would be submitting a revised proposed rule 
that revised proposed rule is expected to be published in the first quarter of certain states in which the company operates  including texas  kansas and oklahoma  and municipalities have adopted  or are considering adopting  regulations that have imposed  or that could impose  more stringent permitting  disclosure  disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations 
for example  in february  the railroad commission of texas implemented the fracturing disclosure rule  requiring public disclosure of all the chemicals in fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
local ordinances or other regulations may regulate or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and hydraulic fracturing in particular 
if new laws or regulations that significantly restrict or regulate hydraulic fracturing are adopted at either the state or the federal level  the company s fracturing activities could become subject to additional permit requirements  reporting requirements or operational restrictions and also to associated permitting delays  or additional costs could adversely affect the determination of whether a well is commercially viable 
restrictions on hydraulic fracturing could also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that the company is ultimately able to produce in commercial quantities 
in addition to asserting regulatory authority  a number of federal entities are analyzing  or have been requested to review  a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing 
in april  president obama issued an executive order that established a working group for the purpose of coordinating policy  information sharing  and planning among federal agencies and offices regarding unconventional natural gas production  including hydraulic fracturing 
in december  the epa issued an initial progress report on a study begun in of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with a final report expected to be issued in late the epa has also announced its intent to propose by effluent limit guidelines that waste water from shale gas extraction operations must meet before going to a treatment plant  the agency also projects that it will publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding toxic substances control act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing 
additionally  a committee of the united states house of representatives has conducted an investigation of hydraulic fracturing practices  and certain members of congress have called upon the us government accountability office to investigate how hydraulic fracturing might adversely affect water resources  the sec to investigate the natural gas industry and any possible misleading of investors or the public regarding the economic feasibility of pursuing natural gas deposits in shales by means of hydraulic fracturing  and the us energy information administration to provide a better understanding of that agency s estimates regarding natural gas reserves  including reserves from shale formations  as well as uncertainties associated with those estimates 
bills previously have been introduced in both the senate and the house of representatives to  among other things  amend the federal safe drinking water act to repeal provisions that currently exempt hydraulic fracturing operations from restrictions that otherwise would apply to underground injection of fluids or propping agents 
the studies and initiatives described above  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur efforts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the safe drinking water act or other regulatory mechanisms 

table of contents climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas that the company produces while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt the company s production and cause the company to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of ghgs present a danger to public health and the environment because such gases are contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
these findings allow the epa to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of ghgs under existing provisions of the clean air act 
accordingly  the epa has adopted rules that require a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and also trigger clean air act construction and operating permit review for ghg emissions from certain stationary sources 
the epa s endangerment finding and ghg rules were upheld by the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit in a june decision  and a petition for review of the case by the entire dc circuit was denied in december the epa also has adopted rules requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and processing facilities in the united states on an annual basis 
the company believes it has complied with all applicable reporting requirements to date 
however  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of ghgs from  the company s equipment and operations could require it to incur additional costs to reduce emissions of ghgs associated with its operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that it produces 
finally  to the extent increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  droughts  floods and other climatic events  such events could have a material adverse effect on the company s assets and operations  and potentially subject the company to greater regulation 
in addition  congress has considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and more than half of the states have begun taking actions to control and or reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the adoption of a climate change action plan  completion of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
any future federal laws or implemented regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions could require the company to incur increased operating costs  adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that the company produces and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
repercussions from terrorist activities or armed conflict could harm the company s business 
terrorist activities  anti terrorist efforts or other armed conflict involving the united states or its interests abroad may adversely affect the united states and global economies and could prevent the company from meeting its financial and other obligations 
if events of this nature occur and persist  the attendant political instability and societal disruption could reduce overall demand for oil and natural gas  potentially putting downward pressure on prevailing oil and natural gas prices and causing a reduction in the company s revenues 
oil and natural gas production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks  and or operations could be adversely impacted if infrastructure integral to the company s operations is destroyed by such an attack 
costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats  and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain  if available at all 
if the company fails to maintain an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting  it could adversely affect its ability to accurately report its results 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
the company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of deficiencies  in the company s internal control over financial reporting that results in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
effective internal controls are necessary for the company to provide reliable financial reports and deter and detect any material fraud 
if the company cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent material fraud  its reputation and operating results would be harmed 
the company s efforts to develop and maintain its internal controls may not be successful  and it may be unable to maintain adequate controls over its financial processes and reporting in the future  including future compliance with the obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of any failure to develop or maintain effective controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  including those related to acquired businesses  or other effective improvement of the company s internal controls could harm its operating results 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in the company s reported financial information 

table of contents certain us federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to oil and natural gas production may be eliminated as a result of future legislation 
the obama administration s budget proposals in recent years  including the budget proposal for fiscal year  have included provisions eliminating certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and gas exploration and production 
if enacted into law  these provisions would eliminate certain tax preferences applicable to taxpayers engaged in the exploration or production of natural resources 
these provisions include  but are not limited to i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for united states production activities and iv the increase in the amortization period from two years to seven years for geophysical costs paid or incurred in connection with the exploration for  or development of  oil and gas within the united states 
it is unclear whether any similar provisions will be included in future budget proposals  whether such provisions will actually be enacted or how soon any such provisions would become effective if enacted 
the passage of any legislation relating to such proposals or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could negatively affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
new derivatives legislation and regulation could adversely affect the company s ability to hedge risks associated with its business 
the dodd frank act created a new regulatory framework for oversight of derivatives transactions by the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and the sec 
among other things  the dodd frank act subjects certain swap participants to new capital  margin and business conduct standards 
in addition  the dodd frank act contemplates that where appropriate in light of outstanding exposures  trading liquidity and other factors  swaps broadly defined to include most hedging instruments other than futures will be required to be cleared through a registered clearing facility and traded on a designated exchange or swap execution facility 
the dodd frank act also established a new energy and environmental markets advisory committee to make recommendations to the cftc regarding matters of concern to exchanges  firms  end users and regulators with respect to energy and environmental markets and also expands the cftc s power to impose position limits on specific categories of swaps excluding swaps entered into for bona fide hedging purposes 
there are some exceptions to these requirements for entities that use swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk 
however  although the company may qualify for exceptions  its derivatives counterparties may be subject to new capital  margin and business conduct requirements imposed as a result of the dodd frank act  which may increase the company s transaction costs or make it more difficult for the company to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms 
the company s inability to enter into hedging transactions on favorable terms  or at all  could increase its operating expenses and put it at increased exposure to risks of adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  which could adversely affect the predictability of cash flows from sales of oil and natural gas 
in november  the cftc finalized rules to establish a position limits regime on certain core physical delivery contracts and their economically equivalent derivatives  some of which reference major energy commodities  including oil and natural gas 
the final rules became effective on january  and compliance with the rules was to have become mandatory on october  however  on september  the district court of the district of columbia vacated the cftc s rulemaking and remanded to the cftc for further proceedings 
on november   the cftc voted to appeal the district court s ruling 
it is not clear what regulatory action  if any  the cftc will take in response to the court s decision 
however  regulations that subject the company or its derivatives counterparties to limits on commodity positions could have an adverse effect on its ability to hedge risks associated with its business or on the cost of its hedging activity 

table of contents our business could be negatively affected as a result of a consent solicitation and or proxy contest 
one of the company s stockholders  tpg axon partners  lp  and certain of its affiliates collectively  tpg axon currently is soliciting the written consents of our stockholders to three actions being proposed by tpg axon 
specifically  tpg axon is proposing to amend the company s bylaws to de stagger the board by providing that directors will be elected for one year terms  provide that the size of the board may be fixed by either a majority vote of the board or vote of the stockholders  provide that vacancies on the board may be filled by the stockholders or by a majority vote of the remaining directors of the board  and provide that directors may be removed with or without cause  remove  without cause  all seven current members of the board  and elect as directors tpg axon s own nominees the tpg axon nominees 
tpg axon has further advocated for the removal of the company s chief executive officer and the engagement of an advisor to explore strategic alternatives  including a potential sale of the company 
the company s business  operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected by tpg axon s consent solicitation because  among other things considering and responding to the consent solicitation and related actions by tpg axon  including  but not limited to  issues related to the qualifications of the company s chief executive officer  board and management  has been  and may continue to be  disruptive  costly and time consuming  and a significant distraction for the company s management and employees  perceived uncertainties as to the company s future direction  including  but not limited to  uncertainties related to the company s chief executive officer  board and management as well as the company s future status  may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel  if the tpg axon nominees are elected to the company s board of directors and the company s chief executive officer or other senior executives are removed  it may adversely affect the company s ability to create additional value for its stockholders by effectively implementing its business strategy  the removal and replacement of a majority of the board of directors as a result of the tpg axon consent solicitation could constitute a change of control under certain of the company s material agreements  which could have material adverse consequences under such agreements  the removal and replacement of a majority of the board as a result of tpg axon s consent solicitation would result in the accelerated vesting of a substantial number of shares of restricted stock held by employees and senior management  reducing the effectiveness of the restricted stock awards as tools for retaining individuals with expertise in the company s key operating areas  and the actions taken by tpg axon have created an environment conducive to follow on litigation  described below under item  which serves as a further distraction to the company s management and employees and requires it to incur significant costs 
costs associated with the consent solicitation  related actions  and litigation may be substantial 
further  if determined adversely  such litigation could harm the company s business and have a material adverse effect on its results of operations 
in addition  the future trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuation based on the uncertainty associated with tpg axon s consent solicitation 
if tpg axon is unsuccessful in its consent solicitation  it or other stockholders may pursue similar goals at the company s annual meeting of stockholders  including by means of a proxy contest  which could result in the same adverse effects described above

the company intends to use the sales proceeds to fund capital expenditures in the mississippian formation and to reduce outstanding debt  as well as for general corporate purposes 
additionally  the company settled a portion of its existing oil derivative contracts in february prior to their respective maturities to reduce volumes hedged in proportion to the anticipated reduction in daily production volumes due to the sale  which resulted in a realized loss of approximately million 
the company expects lower daily production volumes initially due to the sale of the permian properties  however  it expects full year production to be generally consistent with production based on anticipated growth from the mississippian formation as a result of increased drilling activity 

table of contents based on the net book value  historical costs and proved reserves as of december   the company expects to incur a non cash loss on the sale of the permian properties 
the amount of the loss will be based on final calculations performed as of the closing date

results by segment the company operates in three business segments exploration and production  drilling and oil field services and midstream services 
these segments represent the company s three main business units  each offering different products and services 
the exploration and production segment is engaged in the acquisition  development and production of oil and natural gas properties and includes the activities of the royalty trusts 
the drilling and oil field services segment is engaged in the contract drilling of oil and natural gas wells and provides various oil field services 
the midstream services segment is engaged in the purchasing  gathering  treating and selling of natural gas 
management evaluates the performance of the company s business segments based on income loss from operations  which is defined as segment operating revenues less operating expenses and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
results of these measurements provide important information to the company about the activity  profitability and contributions of each of the company s lines of business 
each of the company s business segments results for the years ended december   and are discussed below 

table of contents exploration and production segment the company generates the majority of its consolidated revenues and cash flow from the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
the company s revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and on the company s ability to find and economically develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves 
prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely and are difficult to predict 
in order to reduce the company s exposure to these fluctuations  the company enters into commodity derivative contracts for a portion of its anticipated future oil and natural gas production 
reducing the company s exposure to price volatility mitigates the risk that it will not have adequate funds available for its capital expenditure programs 
the primary factors affecting the financial results of the company s exploration and production segment are the prices the company receives for its oil and natural gas production  the quantity of oil and natural gas it produces and changes in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts 
the average annual nymex prices for oil and natural gas during the years ended december    and are shown in the following table year ended december  oil per bbl natural gas per mcf

table of contents revenues exploration and production segment revenues from oil and natural gas sales increased million  or in the year ended december  from  primarily as a result of a mmbbl  or  increase in oil production 
natural gas production also increased bcf  or  however  the average price received for natural gas production decreased by per mcf  or  which more than offset the increase in natural gas production 
the increase in oil and natural gas production was due to the acquisition of properties located in the gulf of mexico during the second quarter of combined with increased drilling in the mid continent  where  during  the company completed and commenced production on gross net wells 
exploration and production segment revenues increased million  or  in the year ended december  from  as a result of a increase in oil production and a per barrel  or  increase in the average price received for oil production 
these increases were slightly offset by a decrease in natural gas production and an per mcf  or  decrease in the average price received for natural gas production 
the increase in oil production was due to the inclusion of a full year of production from the permian basin properties acquired in the arena acquisition in july  and increased focus on oil drilling throughout and during  the company completed and commenced production on gross net wells  substantially all of which were located in the mid continent and permian basin 
properties acquired in the arena acquisition produced mmbbls of oil  including production from additional wells drilled on the acquired properties  for the year ended december  compared to mmbbls in the period after the acquisition 
the decrease in natural gas production was a result of natural production declines in existing natural gas wells 
during the fourth quarter of  the company substantially completed construction of the century plant and recognized construction contract revenue and costs equal to million  which reflects agreed upon change orders and scope revisions to the original contract 
contract losses incurred on the construction of the century plant were recorded as development costs within the company s oil and natural gas properties 
as of december   the company had recorded a total of million to its oil and natural gas properties for the loss identified based on costs incurred in excess of contract amounts 
operating expenses production expense includes the costs associated with the company s exploration and production activities  including  but not limited to  lease operating expense and treating costs

the following table summarizes the cash settlements and valuation gain and loss on the company s commodity derivative contracts  which are included in income from operations for the exploration and production segment for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  realized gain loss realized gain on early settlements realized loss on amended contracts realized gain loss on settlements at contractual maturity total realized gain loss unrealized gain loss gain loss on commodity derivative contracts the company s derivative contracts are not designated as accounting hedges and  as a result  realized and unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivative contracts are recorded as a component of operating expenses 
internally  management views the settlement of such derivative contracts as adjustments to the price received for oil and natural gas production to determine effective prices 
realized gains or losses related to settlements of derivative contracts prior to their respective contractual maturities early settlements are not considered in the calculation of effective prices 
the realized gain  including realized gain on early settlements  for the year ended december  was due primarily to lower oil prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price for the company s oil price swaps 
these gains were partially offset by a non cash realized loss resulting from the amendment of certain derivative contracts to contracts maturing in and the realized loss for the year ended december  was primarily due to higher oil prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price for the company s oil price swaps 
realized gains resulting from early settlements of commodity derivative contracts partially offset the realized loss for the year ended december  the realized gain  including realized gain on early settlements  for the year ended december  was primarily due to lower natural gas prices at the time of settlement compared to the contract price on the company s natural gas price swaps 
unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts represents the change in fair value of open derivative contracts during the period 
the unrealized gains on the company s commodity contracts recorded during the years ended december  and were attributable to a decrease in average oil prices at the end of the period compared to the average oil prices at the beginning of the period  or the contract price for contracts entered into during the period 
the unrealized loss on commodity contracts recorded during the year ended december  was attributable to an increase in average oil prices and decreases in the price differentials on the company s natural gas basis swaps at december  compared to the average oil prices and price differentials at december  or the contract price for contracts entered into during see consolidated results of operations below for a discussion of other operating expenses

while the company s earnings have been trending upward  the company s month cumulative earnings remained a loss through the quarter ending september   but turned positive for the month period ending december  however  such positive earnings are not a definitive factor in determining to release a valuation allowance as other available evidence should be considered 
for purposes of the valuation allowance analysis  earnings is defined as pre tax earnings as adjusted for permanent tax adjustments 
during the quarter ended december   the company announced the sale of the permian properties  which closed on february  see note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for discussion of the sale of the permian properties 
while this transaction had not yet closed at december   it is appropriate to place some weight on the impact of such a future transaction for purposes of the valuation allowance analysis 
based on net book value  historical costs and proved reserves as of december   the company has calculated an estimated loss on the sale of approximately million 
this loss is expected to cause the company to revert to negative earnings for the month period ending march  however  the book loss of approximately million and the resulting negative earnings for the month period ending march  may change materially based on final calculations performed as of the closing date 
table of contents and actual results of the period 
management has taken into account the current expectation of reverting to a cumulative negative earnings position for the month period ending march  in its decision to maintain the valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
in recent years  the company has experienced significant earnings volatility due to substantial changes in the market price of natural gas 
in  the company s earnings were primarily derived from natural gas sales and during and the market price of natural gas declined significantly 
since  natural gas prices have remained relatively low 
in  the company engaged in a strategy to change its focus from the exploration and production of natural gas to that of oil based on the view that natural gas prices would remain under long term pressure due to the continued drilling in gas focused plays and that oil would provide a more stable revenue stream for the company over the long term 
as a result of this strategy  the company s revenues are now primarily derived from oil sales and the company continues to take additional steps to further ensure stockholder value and future profitability 
the company s revenue  profitability and future growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing and future prices for oil and natural gas 
the markets for these commodities continue to be volatile 
relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect the company s financial results and impede its growth 
changes in oil and natural gas prices have a significant impact on the value of the company s reserves and on its cash flow 
prices for oil and natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas and a variety of additional factors that are beyond the company s control 
due to these factors  management has placed a lower weight on the prospects of future earnings in its overall analysis of the valuation allowance 
in evaluating whether to release all or a portion of the valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset  the company concluded that despite positive earnings for the current period  the objectively verifiable negative evidence of cumulative negative earnings in recent years  along with the current expectation of reverting to a negative earnings position for the month period ending march   outweighs the subjective positive evidence of the general upward trend in recent earnings continuing through the prospects of future earnings 
accordingly  the company has not changed its judgment regarding the need for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
however  a continued and sustained increase in the company s profitability could lead to the reversal of its valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset in the near future 
the valuation allowance against the company s net deferred tax asset at december  of million was reduced during the year ended december  by million as a result of the net deferred tax liability recorded as part of the dynamic acquisition 
see note acquisitions and divestitures to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for further information on the dynamic acquisition 
the amount of the potential release of the valuation allowance and corresponding income tax benefit depend on many factors including  but not limited to  additional purchase accounting entries related to the dynamic acquisition  future potential acquisitions and divestitures  the results of current year operations and the prospects of future earnings 
additionally  the company has valuation allowances totaling million against specific deferred tax assets for which management has determined it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized for various reasons 
the valuation allowance against these specific deferred tax assets would not be impacted by the foregoing discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires the company to make assumptions and prepare estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable  however  actual results may differ significantly 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and their values  future production rates and future costs and expenses are inherently uncertain for numerous reasons  including many factors beyond the company s control 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of data available and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  estimates of reserves may be revised based on actual production  results of subsequent exploration and development activities  prevailing commodity prices  operating costs and other factors 
these revisions may be material and could materially affect the company s future depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses 
the company s critical accounting policies and additional information on significant estimates used by the company are discussed below 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 

table of contents derivative financial instruments 
to manage risks related to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices and changes in interest rates  the company enters into oil and natural gas derivative contracts and interest rate swaps 
the company recognizes its derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value with changes in the derivative s fair value being recognized in earnings unless designated as a hedging instrument with specific hedge accounting criteria being met 
the commodity derivative instruments that the company utilizes are primarily to manage the price risk attributable to its expected oil and natural gas production 
the company has elected not to designate price risk management activities as accounting hedges under applicable accounting guidance  and  accordingly  accounts for its commodity derivative contracts at fair value with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings 
the company also utilizes derivatives to manage its exposure to variable interest rates 
none of the company s derivatives were designated as hedging instruments during  and the company nets derivative assets and liabilities whenever it has a legally enforceable master netting agreement with the counterparty to a derivative contract 
the related cash flow impact of the company s derivative activities are reflected as cash flows from operating activities unless the derivative contract contains a significant financing element  in which case  cash settlements are classified as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
fair values of commodity derivative financial instruments are determined primarily by using discounted cash flow calculations or option pricing models  and are based upon inputs that are either readily available in the public market  such as oil and natural gas futures prices  volatility factors  interest rates and discount rates  or can be corroborated from active markets 
estimates of future prices are based upon published forward commodity price curves for oil and natural gas instruments 
valuations also incorporate adjustments for the nonperformance risk of the company s counterparties 
the fair value of the interest rate swap financial instrument is estimated primarily by using discounted cash flow calculations based upon forward interest rate yields  which is the most significant variable input 
these estimates of future yields are based upon utilizing forward curves such as the london interbank offered rate libor provided by third parties 
valuations also incorporate adjustments for the nonperformance risk of the company s counterparty 
proved reserves 
approximately of the company s reserves were estimated by independent petroleum engineers for the year ended december  estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
however  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future revenues  rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the company s control 
estimating reserves is a complex process and relies on assumptions and subjective interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data  and the accuracy of reserve estimates is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  as a result of volatility and changing market conditions  commodity prices and future development costs will change from period to period  causing estimates of proved reserves to change  as well as causing estimates of future net revenues to change 
for the years ended december   and  the company revised its proved reserves from prior years reports by approximately mmboe  mmboe and mmboe  respectively  due to market prices during or at the end of the applicable period  production performance indicating more or less reserves in place  larger or smaller reservoir size than initially estimated or additional proved reserve bookings within the original field boundaries 
estimates of proved reserves are key components of the company s most significant financial estimates involving its rate for recording depreciation and depletion on oil and natural gas properties and its full cost ceiling limitation 
these revisions may be material and could materially affect the company s future depreciation and depletion expenses 
method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
the accounting for the company s business is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and natural gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and natural gas business activities the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
the company uses the full cost method to account for its oil and natural gas properties 
all direct costs and certain indirect costs associated with the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry well costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and natural gas reserves 
amortization of oil and natural gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
sales and abandonments of oil and natural gas properties being amortized are accounted for as adjustments to the full cost pool  with no gain or loss recognized  unless the adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
a significant alteration would not ordinarily be expected to occur upon the sale of reserves involving less than of the proved reserve quantities of a cost center 

table of contents under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion and impairment of oil and natural gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well  lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  the company s financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since the company will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and natural gas depreciation and depletion rate  and the company will not have exploration expenses that successful efforts companies frequently have 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  capitalized costs are subject to a limitation 
the capitalized cost of oil and natural gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and impairment  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the present value of future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves  discounted at per annum  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  plus estimated salvage value  less related tax effects the ceiling limitation 
the company calculates its full cost ceiling limitation using the month average oil and natural gas prices for the most recent months as of the balance sheet date and adjusted for basis or location differential  held constant over the life of the reserves 
if capitalized costs exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
there were no full cost ceiling impairments recorded during  or unproved properties 
the balance of unproved properties consists primarily of costs to acquire unproved acreage 
these costs are initially excluded from the company s amortization base until the outcome of the project has been determined or  generally  until it is known whether proved reserves will or will not be assigned to the property 
the company assesses all properties classified as unproved on a quarterly basis for possible impairment or reduction in value 
the company assesses its properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are individually insignificant 
the company s assessment includes consideration of the following factors  among others intent to drill  remaining lease term  geological and geophysical evaluations  drilling results and activity  the assignment of proved reserves  and the economic viability of development if proved reserves are assigned 
during any period in which these factors indicate an impairment  the cumulative drilling costs incurred to date for such property and all or a portion of the associated leasehold costs are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to amortization 
the company estimates that substantially all of its costs classified as unproved as of the balance sheet date will be evaluated and transferred within a year period from the date of acquisition  contingent on the company s capital expenditures and drilling program 
property  plant and equipment  net 
other capitalized costs  including drilling equipment  natural gas gathering and treating equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
depreciation of such property and equipment is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from to years for buildings and to years for equipment 
when property and equipment components are disposed of  the cost and the related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
assets are considered to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset or asset group including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group 
if an asset or asset group is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause the company to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
in conjunction with the company s substantial completion of the century plant and associated compression and pipeline facilities  and resulting diversion of the company s high co natural gas production from its legacy gas treating plants to the century plant  the company evaluated its gas treating plants and co 
compression facilities for impairment 
due to prevailing low natural gas prices  the company s natural gas production is not projected to reach the available treating capacity at the century plant 
as such  the company anticipates the use of its gas treating plants and co compression facilities in west texas will be limited  and accordingly  recorded a million impairment of its gas treating plants and co compression facilities in the fourth quarter of the fair value of the assets was estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
significant judgments involved in estimating future cash flows of the gas treating plants and co compression facilities include projected levels of natural gas production  the prices of treating services and co sales and operating costs  all of which are subject to change 
see note impairment to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s impairments 

table of contents goodwill 
the company s goodwill represents the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in the arena acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather tested annually for impairment 
the company performs its annual goodwill impairment test as of july and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances exist that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
since quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  fair value is estimated based upon a discounted cash flow approach  the most significant judgments of which include determining the reporting unit s anticipated future cash flows  primarily based on projected oil and natural gas revenues  operating expenses and capital expenditures  which are then discounted using an industry based weighted average cost of capital rate to estimate the fair value for the reporting unit 
the reporting unit s future cash flows are estimated based on a number of variables which are subject to change  including proved reserves and risk adjusted unproved reserves attributable to the reporting unit  estimated oil and natural gas sales using estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves and estimates of market prices considering forward commodity price curves at the measurement date and operating and development costs 
the company s annual evaluation of goodwill was completed as of july  with no impairment indicated 
the company s estimate of fair value exceeded the book value of the reporting unit in the company s impairment test  such that even if the estimated fair value used in the company s impairment test was reduced by  no impairment would have resulted 
the company also monitors potential impairment indicators throughout the year 
such indicators could include  but are not limited to a significant or sustained decrease in oil and natural gas prices  a significant adverse change in the economic or business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator and the likelihood that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to sell the permian properties  which the company determined to be a triggering event 
as such  an impairment test was performed as of december  primarily as a result of a decrease in the company s probable reserves as of december   which is one of the significant components in the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value 
probable reserves used in the reporting unit fair value calculation decreased due to their reclassification to possible reserves as a result of the company s year end evaluation of drilling results across its acreage in the mississippian formation 
possible reserves are not included in the fair value calculation of the reporting unit 
the company performed step two of the impairment test which indicated the carrying value of goodwill was fully impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment of the full carrying amount of goodwill of million at december  asset retirement obligations 
asset retirement obligations represent the estimate of fair value to plug  abandon and remediate the company s wells at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal and state laws 
the company estimates the fair value of an asset s retirement obligation in the period in which the liability is incurred  if a reasonable estimate can be made 
estimating future asset retirement obligations requires management to make estimates and judgments regarding timing  existence of a liability and what constitutes adequate restoration 
the company employs a present value technique to estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation  which reflects certain assumptions and requires significant judgment  including an inflation rate  its credit adjusted  risk free interest rate  the estimated settlement date of the liability and the estimated current cost to settle the liability based on third party quotes and current actual costs 
inherent in the present value calculation rates are the timing of settlement and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments  which are subject to change 
changes in timing or to the original estimate of cash flows will result in changes to the carrying amount of the liability 
revenue recognition and natural gas balancing 
oil and natural gas revenues are recorded when title of sold oil and natural gas production passes to the customer  net of royalties  discounts and allowances  as applicable 
taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil and natural gas sales are presented separately from such revenues and included in production tax expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company accounts for natural gas production imbalances using the sales method  whereby it recognizes revenue on all natural gas sold to its customers notwithstanding the fact that its ownership may be less than of the natural gas sold 
liabilities are recorded for imbalances greater than the company s proportionate share of remaining estimated natural gas reserves 
the company accounts for its two construction contracts  discussed in note construction contracts to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  using the completed contract method  under which contract revenues and costs are recognized when work under the contract is completed or substantially completed and assets have been transferred 
in the interim  costs incurred on and billings related to contracts in process are accumulated on the balance sheet 
contract gains or losses are recorded as development costs within the company s oil and natural gas properties as part of the full cost pool 
contract losses are recorded at the time it is determined that a loss will be incurred 
contract gains  if any  are recorded upon substantial completion of construction 

table of contents the company recognizes revenues and expenses generated from daywork and footage drilling contracts as the services are performed as the company does not bear the risk of completion of the well 
the company may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment and personnel 
mobilization fees received and costs incurred to mobilize a rig from one market to another are recognized over the term of the related drilling contract 
the contract terms typically range from one month to two years 
in general  natural gas purchased and sold by the midstream business is priced at a published daily or monthly index price 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
revenues are recognized upon delivery of natural gas to customers and or when services are rendered  pricing is determined and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenues from third party midstream services are presented on a gross basis  as the company acts as a principal by taking ownership of the natural gas purchased and taking responsibility of fulfillment for natural gas volumes sold 
revenue from sales of co is recognized when the product is delivered to the customer 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are recorded for temporary differences between financial statement and income tax basis 
temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax basis 
deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years tax returns 
as of december   the company continued to have a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax asset 
the valuation allowance serves to reduce the tax benefits recognized from the net deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on the weight of all available evidence 
variable interest entities 
an entity is referred to as a vie if it possesses one of the following criteria i it is thinly capitalized  ii the residual equity holders do not control the entity  iii the equity holders are shielded from the economic losses  iv the equity holders do not participate fully in the entity s residual economics  or v the entity was established with non substantive voting interests 
the company consolidates a vie when it has determined it is the primary beneficiary  which requires significant judgment 
the primary beneficiary of a vie has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the activities of the vie and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in addition to the vies that the company consolidates  the company also holds a variable interest in another vie that is not consolidated as it was determined that the company is not the primary beneficiary 
the company continually monitors both consolidated and unconsolidated vies to determine if any events have occurred that could cause the primary beneficiary to change 
see note variable interest entities to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a discussion of the company s vies 
allocation of purchase price in business combinations 
accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording each asset and liability at its estimated fair value 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and tax related carryforwards at the acquisition date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  the company makes various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions related to the estimated fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties 
to estimate the fair values of these properties  the company prepares estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and factors in a discount for reserve categories based on industry factors applicable to each acquisition 
the prices utilized in the reserves estimates are based upon forward commodity strip prices  after adjustment for transportation fees and regional price differentials  as of the acquisition date for the first four years and escalated for inflation beginning with the fifth year through the end of expected production 
future cash flows are discounted using an industry weighted average cost of capital rate 
estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired can have a significant effect on results of operations in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general this discussion provides information about the financial instruments the company uses to manage commodity prices and interest rate volatility  including instruments used to manage commodity prices for production attributable to the royalty trusts 
all contracts are settled in cash and do not require the actual delivery of a commodity at settlement 
commodity price risk 
the company s most significant market risk relates to the prices it receives for its oil and natural gas production 
due to the historical price volatility of these commodities  the company periodically has entered into  and expects in the future to enter into  derivative arrangements for the purpose of reducing the variability of oil and natural gas prices the company receives for its production 
from time to time  the company enters into commodity pricing derivative contracts for a portion of its anticipated production volumes depending upon management s view of opportunities under the then prevailing current market conditions 
the company s senior credit facility limits its ability to enter into derivative transactions to of expected production volumes from estimated proved reserves 
the company uses  and may continue to use  a variety of commodity based derivative contracts  including fixed price swaps  collars and basis swaps 
at december   the company s commodity derivative contracts consisted of fixed price swaps  collars and basis swaps  which are described below fixed price swaps the company receives a fixed price for the contract and pays a floating market price to the counterparty over a specified period for a contracted volume 
collars two way collars contain a fixed floor price put and a fixed ceiling price call 
if the market price exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  the company receives the fixed price and pays the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike price  no payments are due from either party 
three way collars have two fixed floor prices a purchased put and a sold put and a fixed ceiling price call 
the purchased put establishes a minimum price unless the market price falls below the sold put  at which point the minimum price would be nymex plus the difference between the purchased put and the sold put strike price 
the call establishes a maximum price ceiling the company will receive for the volumes under the contract 
basis swaps the company receives a payment from the counterparty if the settled price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the settled price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract  which guarantees the company a price differential for oil and natural gas from a specified delivery point 
the company s oil fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon the average daily prices for the calendar month or quarter of the contract period 
the company s oil basis swap transactions are settled based upon the differential between the nymex or argus west texas intermediate price and the argus louisiana light sweet price 
the company s two way and three way oil collars are settled based upon the arithmetic average of nymex oil prices during the calculation period for the relevant contract 
the company s natural gas fixed price swap transactions are settled based upon nymex prices  and the company s natural gas basis swap transactions are settled based upon the index price of natural gas at the waha hub  a west texas gas marketing and delivery center  or the houston ship channel 
the company s natural gas collars are settled based upon the nymex prices on the penultimate commodity business day for the relevant contract 
settlement for oil derivative contracts occurs in the succeeding month or quarter and natural gas derivative contracts are settled in the production month or quarter 
at december   the company s open commodity derivative contracts consisted of the following oil price swaps notional mbbls weighted average fixed price january december january december january december

the company records all derivative contracts at fair value  which reflects changes in commodity prices 
changes in fair values of the company s derivative contracts are recognized as unrealized gains and losses in current period earnings 
as a result  the company s current period earnings may be significantly affected by changes in the fair value of its commodity derivative contracts 
changes in fair value are principally measured based on period end prices compared to the contract price 
the following table summarizes the cash settlements and valuation gains and losses on the company s commodity derivative contracts for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  realized gain loss unrealized gain loss gain loss on commodity derivative contracts the year ended december  includes million of net realized gain related to early settlements of commodity derivative contracts and a million non cash realized loss on derivative contracts amended in january the years ended december  and include million million realized gain and million realized loss and million of realized gain  respectively  related to early settlements 
see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information regarding the company s commodity derivatives 
credit risk 
all of the company s hedging transactions have been carried out in the over the counter market 
the use of hedging transactions in over the counter markets involves the risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the financial terms of the transactions 
the counterparties for all of the company s hedging transactions have an investment grade credit rating 
the company monitors on an ongoing basis the credit ratings of its hedging counterparties and considers its counterparties credit default risk ratings in determining the fair value of its derivative contracts 
the company s derivative contracts are with multiple counterparties to minimize its exposure to any individual counterparty 

table of contents a default by the company under its senior credit facility constitutes a default under its derivative contracts with counterparties that are lenders under the senior credit facility 
the company does not require collateral or other security from counterparties to support derivative instruments 
the company has master netting agreements with all of its derivative contract counterparties  which allows the company to net its derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty 
as a result of the netting provisions  the company s maximum amount of loss under derivative transactions due to credit risk is limited to the net amounts due from the counterparties under the derivatives 
the company s loss is further limited as any amounts due from a defaulting counterparty that is a lender under the senior credit facility can be offset against amounts owed to such counterparty under the company s senior credit facility 
as of december   the counterparties to the company s open derivative contracts consisted of financial institutions  of which are also lenders under the company s senior credit facility 
as a result  the company is not required to post additional collateral under derivative contracts as the majority of the counterparties to the company s derivative contracts share in the collateral supporting the company s senior credit facility 
to secure their obligations under the derivative contracts novated by the company  the permian trust and mississippian trust ii have each given the counterparties to such contracts a lien on their royalty interest 
see note variable interest entities to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information on the permian trust s and mississippian trust ii s derivative contracts 
the company s ability to fund its capital expenditure budget is partially dependent upon the availability of funds under its senior credit facility 
in order to mitigate the credit risk associated with individual financial institutions committed to participate in the senior credit facility  the company s bank group currently consists of financial institutions with commitments ranging from to of the borrowing base 
interest rate risk 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed and variable interest rate borrowings 
fixed rate debt  where the interest rate is fixed over the life of the instrument  exposes the company to i changes in market interest rates reflected in the fair value of the debt and ii the risk that the company may need to refinance maturing debt with new debt at a higher rate 
variable rate debt  where the interest rate fluctuates  exposes the company to short term changes in market interest rates as its interest obligations on these instruments are periodically redetermined based on prevailing market interest rates  primarily the libor and the federal funds rate 
the company had no outstanding variable rate debt as of december  the company has a million notional interest rate swap agreement  which effectively fixed the variable interest rate on the senior floating rate notes at an annual rate of for periods prior to their tender and redemption in the third quarter of the interest rate swap terminates april  and has not been designated as a hedge
