item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and torchmark s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
results of operations acquisition on november   we acquired family heritage  a previously privately held supplemental health insurance carrier 
information about this acquisition can be found in note acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the results of family heritage subsequent to our acquisition are included in this discussion within our health insurance segment 
discontinued operations as described in note discontinued operations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our subsidiary united investors life insurance company united investors as of december  because of the sale  united investors financial results are excluded from this discussion since those operations were discontinued 
how torchmark views its operations torchmark is the holding company for a group of insurance companies which market primarily individual life and supplemental health insurance  and to a limited extent annuities  to middle income households throughout the united states 
we view our operations by segments  which are the insurance product lines of life  health  and annuities  and the investment segment that supports the product lines 
segments are aligned based on their common characteristics  comparability of the profit margins  and management techniques used to operate each segment 
insurance product line segments 
as fully described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the product line segments involve the marketing  underwriting  and the administration of policies 
each product line is further segmented by the various distribution units that market the insurance policies 
each distribution unit operates in a niche market offering insurance products designed for that particular market 
whether analyzing profitability of a segment as a whole  or the individual distribution units within the segment  the measure of profitability used by management is the underwriting margin  which is premium revenue less policy obligations policy acquisition costs and commissions investment segment 
the investment segment involves the management of our capital resources  including investments and the management of corporate debt and liquidity 
our measure of profitability for the investment segment is excess investment income  which is net investment income less required interest on net policy liabilities financing costs the tables in note business segments reconcile torchmark s revenues and expenses by segment to its major income statement line items for each of the years in the three year period ending december  additionally  this note provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year to year comparability and which reconciles to net income 
that summary is reproduced below from the consolidated financial statements to present our overall operations in the manner that we use to manage the business

torchmark s operations on a segment by segment basis are discussed in depth under the appropriate captions following in this report 
summary of operations net income rose to million in from million in it had declined slightly in from million in on a diluted per share basis  net income rose to after a increase in to from net income of in the per share results have exceeded the growth in dollar amounts due to our share repurchase program 
results in include a million after tax loss on the disposal of united investors  representing

also  each year s per share net income was affected by realized investment gains  which were   and in   and  respectively 
more information concerning realized investment gains and losses can be found under the caption realized gains and losses in this report where there is a more complete discussion 
also  as explained in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we do not consider realized gains and losses to be a component of our core insurance operations or operating segments 
additionally  we do not consider non operating items which are not related to the current ongoing reporting performance of our segments to be part of our segment operating income 
as shown in the above chart  after tax segment results of operations  before discontinued operations  rose each year over the prior year from million in to million in to million in the primary contributor to the growth in both and was the underwriting margin in our life insurance segment  in which margins rose million in and million in the life insurance segment is our strongest segment and is the largest contributor to earnings in each year presented 
also contributing to growth in income was our health insurance segment  which provided million of additional margin after a decline of million in the improvement was largely due to the increased volume in our medicare part d program while the decline was a result of the discontinuance of sales of certain limited benefit health products in late due to healthcare reform 
both and have been impacted negatively by declines in excess investment income  the measure of profitability of our investment segment 
these declines in excess investment income have resulted from the continuing low interest rate environment which has pressured investment yields and spreads on policy benefit requirements  discussed more fully under the caption investments in this report 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in  this pressure on excess investment income was increased as an unusual number of calls  resulting from a new regulation affecting bank hybrid securities  caused us to replace these higher yielding securities with securities at lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment 
also in  there was a million increase in stock compensation expense which negatively affected the results during the year 
the increase in stock compensation expense resulted primarily from the increase in the value of torchmark s stock and not from an increase in the number of grants 
total revenues rose in to billion 
they were flat in at billion compared with billion in life premium rose or million in to billion 
life premium increased million in to billion 
net investment income was essentially flat at million in  after rising or million in health premium increased to billion in and contributed million to revenue growth  but health premium negatively affected revenue growth in as discussed below 
while life insurance premium has grown steadily in each of the three years ending december   margins as a percentage of premium have risen even more  rising in to from in and in segment profits for life insurance were not only positively affected by the premium growth  but also by improvements in persistency in both periods 
life net sales increased in to million  but declined in to million 
life insurance segment results are discussed further in this report under the caption life insurance 
we primarily market medicare supplement insurance  medicare part d prescription drug insurance  limited benefit cancer  and accident health products 
prior to september   we marketed an under age limited benefit hospital surgical product 
health premium increased million or in  as a result of the addition of a large number of new low income medicare part d auto enrollees in the plan year 
however  health premium declined to million as a result of the discontinuance of certain limited benefit health products because of healthcare reform mentioned above 
medicare supplement remains our largest contributor to total health premium  and we have experienced growth in net sales in this product in each successive year 
medicare supplement premium was million in but has declined slightly in each successive year as lapses have exceeded new sales 
our medicare part d premium rose to in as a result of the previously noted addition of low income auto enrollees in the plan 
due to increased competition for the plan year  we expect a slight decrease in part d premium 
see the discussion under health insurance for a more detailed discussion of health insurance results 
we offer fixed annuities  but we do not emphasize sales of annuity products  favoring life insurance instead 
with the sale of united investors in  we disposed of of our annuity deposit balance 
see the caption annuities for further discussion of the annuity segment 
as previously mentioned  the investment segment s pretax profitability  or excess investment income  declined in both and profitability in this segment is based on three major components net investment income  required interest on net policy liabilities interest applicable to insurance products  and financing costs 
in recent years  growth in net investment income has been restricted in relation to the growth in the size of our portfolio 
one reason that investment income has grown at a lower rate than mean invested assets has grown in recent years is that new investments have been made at yield rates lower than the yield rates earned on securities that matured or were otherwise disposed of 
also  there is sometimes a lag between the time when proceeds from maturities and dispositions are received and when the proceeds are reinvested  during which the funds are held in cash 
growth in total investment income has also been somewhat negatively affected by torchmark s share repurchase program described later under this caption  which has diverted cash that could have otherwise been used to acquire investments 
in  net investment income rose while the portfolio at amortized cost grew  as new money yields available have continued to decline 
the interest required on net policy liabilities is deducted from net investment income  and generally grows in conjunction with the net policy liabilities that are supported by the invested assets 
the lower new money yields resulting from the low interest rate environment noted above have compressed excess investment income as required interest has continued to grow 
we have implemented certain strategies to offset this effect  including lowering the discount rate on new business and increasing premium rates on 
table of contents 
index to financial statements sales of new products as discussed under the caption investments 
financing costs  which consist of the interest required for debt service on our long and short term debt  are also deducted from net investment income 
financing costs in increased to million  primarily as a result of two new debt offerings issued in the latter half of as described below 
financing costs also increased from million in to million in  primarily a result of increased charges related to our letters of credit facility 
torchmark s current investment policy limits new investment acquisitions to investment grade fixed maturities generally with longer maturities often exceeding twenty years that meet our quality and yield objectives 
approximately of our invested assets at fair value consist of fixed maturities of which were investment grade at december  the average quality rating of the portfolio was a 
the portfolio contains no securities backed by sub prime or alt a mortgages  no direct investment in residential mortgages  no counterparty risks  no credit default swaps  or derivative contracts 
see the analysis of excess investment income and investment activities under the caption investments in this report and note investments in the notes to consolidated statements of operations for a more detailed discussion of this segment 
as noted earlier  we issued two new debt offerings during our million principal amount senior notes due and our million principal amount junior subordinated debentures due  both issued in september 
proceeds from the senior notes were million  but million were purchased by our insurance subsidiaries and were eliminated in consolidation 
proceeds from this offering provided funding for the retirement of our senior notes due in august  and for the acquisition of family heritage in november  the million net proceeds from the subordinated debentures were used to fund the call of our million principal amount trust originated preferred securities in october  more information on these transactions can be found in note acquisition and note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in our discussion of capital resources in this report 
in  income from continuing operations was affected by certain significant  unusual  and nonrecurring nonoperating items 
we do not view these items as components of core operating results because they are not indicative of past performance or future prospects of the insurance operations 
as reported in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption settlements  we were involved in certain issues in which we incurred settlement losses and expenses 
we settled a state administrative matter in the pretax amount of million million after tax and accrued an estimated liability for a litigation amount which settled in early in the pretax amount of million million after tax 
both of these issues involved matters arising many years ago 
additionally  in connection with the purchase of family heritage as described in note acquisition  we incurred million of acquisition related expenses million after tax 
the state administrative settlement  the litigation accrual  and the acquisition expenses are included in other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
however  as described in note  we remove items such as these that relate to prior periods or are non operating items when evaluating the results of current operations  and therefore exclude such matters from our segment analysis for current periods 
torchmark has in place an ongoing share repurchase program which began in with no specified authorization amount  we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of the company s excess cash flow  general market conditions  and other alternative uses 
the majority of these purchases are made from excess operating cash flow when market prices are favorable 
additionally  when stock options are exercised  proceeds from these exercises and the tax benefit are used to repurchase additional shares on the open market to minimize dilution as a result of the option exercises 
due to poor economic conditions  we temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in the first quarter of however  in the first quarter of  the board of directors reactivated the company s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management  in consultation with the board  determines to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders

a discussion of each of torchmark s segments follows 
the following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations  as described in note business segments 
life insurance 
life insurance is our largest insurance segment  with life premium representing of total premium 
life underwriting income before other income and administrative expense represented of the total in additionally  investments supporting the reserves for life products produce the majority of excess investment income attributable to the investment segment 
life insurance premium rose to billion in after having increased in to billion 
life insurance products are marketed through several distribution channels 
premium income by channel for each of the last three years is as follows life insurance premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total american income exclusive agency direct response liberty national exclusive agency other agencies we use three statistical measures as indicators of premium growth and sales over the near term annualized premium in force  net sales  and first year collected premium 
annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period 
annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue 
net sales is annualized premium issued  net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue  except in the case of direct response where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer period has expired 
we believe that net sales is a superior indicator of the rate of premium growth relative to annualized premium issued 
first year collected premium is defined as the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year 
first year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first year when lapses are more likely to occur  and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future

index to financial statements annualized life premium in force was billion at december   an increase of over billion a year earlier

life insurance first year collected premium by distribution method dollar amounts in thousands amount of total amount of total amount of total american income exclusive agency direct response liberty national exclusive agency other agencies the american income exclusive agency has historically focused primarily on marketing to members of labor unions 
while the labor union market is still the backbone of american income s business  the agency has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help to ensure sustainable growth 
it is torchmark s highest margin business 
the american income agency was also the largest contributor to life premium and net sales of any torchmark distribution method in life premium for this agency rose to million  after having risen in net sales increased in after having risen in net sales rose in the average face amount of policies issued in was approximately thousand 
as is the case with all of torchmark s agency distribution systems  continued increases in product sales are largely dependent on increases in agent count 
the american income agent count was  at december  compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the agent count increased in management s primary objective is to grow middle management in the agency to help ensure sustainable growth 
this is being achieved through an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel 
in  we began providing more home office and webinar training programs 
these programs are designed to provide each agent  from new recruits to top level managers  coaching and instruction specifically designed for his or her level of experience and responsibilities 
the direct response unit reaches the market through a variety of direct to consumer marketing approaches which include direct mailings  insert media  internet  and inbound telephone calls 
these different approaches support and complement one another in our efforts to reach the consumer 
direct 
table of contents 
index to financial statements response focuses primarily on young middle income households with children 
the juvenile life insurance policy is a key product for this unit 
not only is the juvenile market an important source of sales  it is also a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of the juvenile policyholders 
also  both the juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time 
at this time  we believe that the direct response unit is the largest us writer of juvenile direct mail life insurance 
we expect that sales to this demographic group will continue as one of direct response s premier markets 
historically  the direct response unit s growth has been fueled by constant innovation 
in recent years  the internet and inbound call center production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased internet marketing activities and focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center 
the direct response operation accounted for of our life insurance premium during  increasing over premium 
life premium for this unit rose in and in net sales rose to million in after being flat in first year collected premium rose to million after a decline of to million in the average face amount of policies issued in was approximately thousand 
the liberty national exclusive agency markets primarily life insurance and supplemental health insurance  focusing on middle income customers 
life premium income for this agency was million in  a decrease compared with million in life premium also declined in from first year collected premium declined in  after having declined in the average face amount of life policies issued in was approximately thousand 
the liberty national agency s net sales declined to million in  after having declined a year earlier 
as is the case with all of our agencies  sales are driven by the size of the agent force 
the liberty agency had  producing agents at december   compared with  a year earlier  an increase of 
the producing agent count declined during the recent declines in premium and sales were due primarily to changes in the cost structure of the agency that have affected agent counts in recent years 
several years ago  management began a process to convert the agency from a fixed expense  salary based agency model to a commission driven variable cost model 
even though we knew the conversion would result in agent defections  the change had to be made to maintain acceptable underwriting margins on new business and ensure the long term survival and growth of this distribution channel 
this was a significant cultural change and it has been implemented gradually to minimize agency disruption as much as possible 
declines in agent count finally ceased in february  and there was a slow steady increase in agent count for the remainder of the year 
liberty has historically focused its marketing efforts in smaller rural areas in the southeastern united states 
going forward  management expects to grow this agency through nationwide geographic expansion into more urban areas and cross selling individual life insurance to customers who purchased group health insurance through liberty s worksite marketing program 
we also offer life insurance through other agencies consisting of the military agency  the united american independent agency  and other small sales agencies 
the military agency consists of a nationwide independent agency whose sales force is comprised primarily of former military officers who sell primarily to commissioned and noncommissioned military officers and their families 
this business consists of whole life products with term insurance riders 
military premium represented of life premium at december  the united american independent agency represented approximately of torchmark s total life premium at that date  as their sales of torchmark products consist primarily of health insurance

health results have been negatively affected by the discontinuance of sales in of a block of hospital surgical limited benefit products which became less marketable due to healthcare reform developments 
these products were also our highest premium  lowest margin products 
health results have also been negatively affected by the earlier restructuring of the liberty national agency as discussed under the caption life insurance

this agency markets primarily limited benefit supplemental health insurance in non urban areas 
most of their policies include a cash back feature  such as a return of premium feature whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy

part d is regulated and partially funded by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for participating private insurers like united american 
under part d  private carriers are the primary insurers  while cms provides significant premium subsidies and reinsurance 
our medicare part d product is sold through the direct response operation and to groups through the ua independent agency

total medicare part d premium was million in  compared with million in  an increase of 
part d premium declined in changes in part d premium generally result from changes in the number of enrollees 
at the beginning of the part d plan year  united american had approximately thousand enrollees  compared with thousand at the beginning of the plan year  thousand at the beginning of the plan year  and thousand at the beginning of the plan year 
united american had large growth in part d enrollees in as a result of a new lower cost part d plan which allowed us to pick up a large number of low income auto enrollees and to grow our own individual sales 
due to intensified price competition for the plan year  we will not qualify for as many new auto enrollees in as we did in however  we expect that only a small number of the auto enrollees assigned to us in will be reassigned to another part d carrier 
while the number of part d enrollees at the beginning of plan year was higher than at the beginning of plan year  it was lower than the number of enrollees at the end of the enrollee count grew throughout due to significant additions of low income enrollees each month  but we lost several employer group part d cases at the end of as such  we expect a lower average number of enrollees for than we had in and we anticipate a slight decline in part d premium in we participate in the medicare part d program because of our experience with the senior age market and with medicare supplements  the government assurances with regard to the risk sharing agreements for participating insurers  limited risk due to the incremental income added to our health insurance margins  and the renewal of the business every year 
due to our experience with service to the senior age market and the use of our existing direct response marketing system  entry to this business required little new investment 
however  as with any government sponsored program  the possibility of regulatory changes could change the outlook for this market

index to financial statements annuities 
as described in note discontinued operations  we sold our subsidiary united investors on december  united investors was our variable annuity carrier and a primary carrier of fixed annuities 
because we disposed of approximately of our annuity deposit balance in the sale  including all of our variable annuities  we do not expect that annuities will be a significant portion of our business or marketing strategy going forward 
our fixed annuity balances at the end of   and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
underwriting income was million  million  million in each of the years   and  respectively 
while the fixed annuity account balance has increased modestly each year over the prior year and underwriting income has increased each year as well  policy charges have actually declined slightly in each successive year 
the majority of policy charges consist of surrender charges which are not based on account size 
these charges have remained somewhat level in recent periods 
a considerable portion of fixed annuity profitability is derived from the spread of investment income exceeding contractual interest requirements  which can result in negative net policy obligations 
in each of the years presented  the spreads for fixed annuities increased over the prior year as a result of credited rate reductions on the inforce annuities accounting for the growth in underwriting margin 
the amortization of deferred acquisition costs also rose as these costs are amortized in relation to gross profits

in to 
the increase in total insurance administrative expense of million was primarily the result of the expiration of a third party agreement under which we were reimbursed a net of million in for providing policy administration services  and million from the addition of family heritage s expenses in the decline in employee costs in was primarily due to unusually high employee health insurance costs in stock compensation expense has risen in each successive year as the value of torchmark stock has increased  resulting in higher values for grants of stock and options and not because of an increase in the number of grants 
as stated in note business segments in the notes to consolidated financial statements  management views stock compensation expense as a corporate expense  and therefore treats it as a parent company expense 
as a result of the acquisition of family heritage in late as described in note acquisition in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we incurred expenses related to the transaction of million 
additionally  as mentioned in note significant accounting policies  we incurred two settlement expense issues in that related to events occurring many years ago the settlement of a state administrative issue of million and a litigation issue in the estimated amount of million 
the latter item was settled in that amount in in addition to these two items  we sold aviation equipment in at a loss of thousand 
while all of these nonrecurring expenses were included in operating expenses for the respective year in the consolidated statements of operations in accordance with accounting guidance  they are considered as non operating expenses by management 
investments 
we manage our capital resources including investments  debt  and cash flow through the investment segment 
excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations 
it is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in note business segments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
it is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or financing costs 
we also view excess investment income per diluted share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment 
it is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding  representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the company 
since implementing our share repurchase program in  we have used over billion of cash flow to repurchase torchmark shares after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives 
share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest bearing assets  but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding 
in order to put all capital resource uses on a comparable basis  we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment

excess investment income declined million or in from the prior year 
excess investment income declined million or in excess investment income has been pressured over the past three years as a result of the impact of lower interest rates on net investment income coupled with the increase in required interest on net policy liabilities discussed later under this caption 
on a per diluted share basis  excess investment income rose to per share in  after having risen in the prior year 
the favorable increases in the per share amounts relative to the changes in dollar amounts for excess investment income are a result of share repurchases 
the largest component of excess investment income is net investment income  as adjusted for the segment analysis  which rose to million in it increased to million in from million in presented in the following chart is the growth in net investment income compared with the growth in mean invested assets 
growth in net investment income growth in mean invested assets at amortized cost growth in net investment income has generally been slower than growth in mean invested assets in recent years due to the declining interest rate environment 
in a declining interest rate environment  the overall portfolio yield will decrease as new money is invested at lower yields  especially when the new investments are replacing higher yielding investments that mature or are otherwise disposed of 
approximately of the invested assets added in through replaced higher yielding assets that matured or were disposed of during that period 
this level of replacement activity was higher than normal 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we had more sales of investments than usual in each of the years through these sales were generally made due to credit concerns or for tax purposes 
additionally in  we had an unusually large number of securities called 
fixed maturity securities are more likely to be called in a declining interest rate environment 
in addition to bonds with scheduled call dates  our portfolio includes bank issued hybrid securities with provisions allowing the security to be called in the event of a change in capital treatment 
many banks chose to call their hybrid securities in because the dodd frank act phases out the partial equity credit historically allowed for these securities 
at december   we still held million of bank hybrids callable without a make whole provision 
the average yield on these securities was 
approximately of these securities was below investment grade 
to the extent these are called  there would be a reduction in net investment income 
however  the ratio of below investment grade securities to our total investment portfolio and statutory required capital would also decrease 
in  growth in net investment income slightly exceeded the growth in the portfolio 
because of the uncertainty about liquidity in the financial markets in  we held significantly more cash and short term investments than in other years 
holding this larger balance of low yielding securities in resulted in the unusually high growth rate in as these lower yielding cash balances were invested in excess investment income is reduced by the required interest on net insurance policy liabilities  because we consider these amounts to be components of the profitability of our insurance segments 
required interest is the actuarial interest assumption used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force 
essentially all of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest rate protection policies  not investment products  and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long duration insurance products formerly sfas  now incorporated into asc  which mandates that interest rate assumptions be locked in for the life of that block of business 
each calendar year  we set the assumed discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year 
that rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year  and cannot be changed except in the event of a premium deficiency 
the discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in 
as such  the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years 
changes in the overall weighted average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business 
business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted average discount rate due to the size of our in force business

excess investment income is also impacted by financing costs 
financing costs for the investment segment primarily consist of interest on our various debt instruments and are deducted from excess investment income

financing costs increased million or in they rose million or in the increase in financing costs in reflects the increased interest expense from the issuance in september of million principal amount of our senior notes due in  million of which is eliminated in consolidation 
also in september   we issued our junior subordinated debentures due for million principal amount but called our million trust preferred securities one month later 
the and increases in interest on short term debt were primarily a result of the million increase in financing charges on our letter of credit facility  arising from the december  restructuring of our credit facility 
more information on our debt transactions are disclosed in the financial condition section of this report and in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements excess investment income benefits from increases in long term rates available on new investments and decreases in short term borrowing rates 
of these two factors  higher investment rates have the greater impact because the amount of cash that we invest is significantly greater than the amount that we borrow at short term rates 
therefore  torchmark would benefit if rates  especially long term rates  were to rise 
however  growth rates in our excess investment income decline when growth in income from the portfolio is less than that of the interest required by policy liabilities and financing costs  such as we have experienced in recent periods 
in an extended low interest rate environment  the portfolio yield will tend to decline as we invest new money at lower long term rates 
we believe  however  the decline would be relatively slow  as  on average  only to of fixed maturities are expected to run off each year over the next five years 
in response to the lower interest rates  we reduced the discount rate on life policies issued in we also raised the premium rates for new business on major life products in the increased premiums will provide additional margin on these policies to help offset the possible future reductions in excess investment income and have not had a detrimental impact on sales 
because actuarial discount rates are locked in for life on essentially all of our business  benefit reserves and deferred acquisition costs are not affected by interest rate fluctuations unless a loss recognition event occurs 
due to the strength of our underwriting margins and the current positive spread between the yield on our investment portfolio and the weighted average discount rate of our in force block  we don t expect an extended low interest rate environment to cause a loss recognition event 
investment acquisitions 
torchmark s current investment policy calls for investing almost exclusively in investment grade fixed maturities generally with long maturities maturity date more than years after acquisition date that meet our quality and yield objectives 
we generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long term nature of our policy liabilities 
further  we believe this strategy is appropriate because our strong positive cash flows are generally stable and predictable 
if such longer term securities do not meet our quality and yield objectives  we consider investing in short term securities  taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors at the time 
during calendar years through  torchmark invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  primarily with longer term maturities as presented in the chart below 
the following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases 
the effective annual yield shown in the table is the yield calculated to the potential termination date that produces the lowest yield

table of contents 
index to financial statements we prefer to invest primarily in bonds that are not callable on other than a make whole basis prior to maturity  but we periodically invest some funds in callable bonds when the incremental yield available on such bonds warrants doing so 
for investments in callable bonds  the actual life of the investment will depend on whether the issuer calls the investment prior to the maturity date 
given our investments in callable bonds  the actual average life of our investments can not be known at the time of the investment 
however  the average life will not be less than the average life to next call and will not exceed the average life to maturity 
data for both of these average life measures is provided in the above chart 
during the three years through  we have invested primarily in investment grade corporate bonds 
purchases in and consisted almost entirely of these corporates 
during  we acquired a significant amount of taxable municipal bonds  primarily build america bonds authorized by the american recovery and retirement act of the investments in these municipal bonds consisted almost exclusively of general obligation bonds and revenue bonds for essential services 
in assessing the creditworthiness of these bonds  we took into account a number of factors  including the geographic location of the municipalities 
new cash flow available for investment is primarily provided through our insurance operations  but has also been affected by other factors 
issuer calls  as a result of the low interest environment experienced during the past three years were a factor 
issuers are more likely to call bonds when rates are low because they often can refinance them at a lower cost 
calls increase funds available for investment  but as noted earlier in this discussion  they can have a negative impact on investment income if the proceeds from the calls are reinvested in bonds that have lower yields than that of the bonds that were called 
issuer calls were million in  million in  and million in the higher level of acquisitions in was primarily due to the additional funds available from the higher level of calls 
portfolio analysis 
because torchmark has recently invested almost exclusively in fixed maturity securities  the relative percentage of our assets invested in various types of investments varies from industry norms 
the following table presents a comparison of torchmark s components of invested assets at amortized cost as of december  with the latest industry data

index to financial statements credit risk sensitivity 
credit risk relates to the level of uncertainty that a security s issuer will maintain its ability to honor the terms of that security until maturity 
approximately of our fixed maturity holdings at book value are in corporate securities including redeemable preferred and asset backed securities 
as we continue to invest in corporate bonds with relatively long maturities  credit risk is a concern 
we mitigate this ongoing risk  in part  by acquiring only investment grade bonds and by analyzing the financial fundamentals of each prospective issuer 
we continue to monitor the status of issuers on an ongoing basis 
we also seek to reduce credit risk by spreading investments over a large number of issuers and a wide range of industry sectors

index to financial statements market risk sensitivity 
torchmark s financial securities are exposed to interest rate risk  meaning the effect of changes in financial market interest rates on the current fair value of the company s investment portfolio 
since of the book value of our investments is attributable to fixed maturity investments and virtually all of these investments are fixed rate investments  the portfolio is highly subject to market risk 
declines in market interest rates generally result in the fair value of the investment portfolio exceeding the book value of the portfolio and increases in interest rates cause the fair value to decline below the book value 
under normal market conditions  we do not expect to realize these unrealized gains and losses because we have the ability and generally the intent to hold these investments to maturity 
the long term nature of our insurance policy liabilities and strong cash flow operating position substantially mitigate any future need to liquidate portions of the portfolio 
the increase or decrease in the fair value of insurance liabilities and debt due to increases or decreases in market interest rates largely offsets the impact of rates on the investment portfolio 
however  in accordance with gaap  these liabilities are not marked to market 
the following table illustrates the market risk sensitivity of our interest rate sensitive fixed maturity portfolio at december  and this table measures the effect of a change in interest rates as represented by the us treasury curve on the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the data measures the change in fair value arising from an immediate and sustained change in interest rates in increments of basis points

table of contents 
index to financial statements realized gains and losses 
our life and health insurance companies collect premium income from policyholders for the eventual payment of policyholder benefits  sometimes paid many years or even decades in the future 
in addition to the payment of these benefits  we also incur acquisition costs  administrative expenses  and taxes as a part of insurance operations 
because benefits are expected to be paid in future periods  premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested to provide for these obligations 
for this reason  we hold a significant investment portfolio as a part of our core insurance operations 
this portfolio consists primarily of high quality fixed maturities containing an adequate yield to provide for the cost of carrying these long term insurance product obligations 
as a result  fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities 
expected yields on these investments are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations 
investments are occasionally sold or called  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
these gains and losses generally occur only incidentally  usually as the result of sales because of deterioration in investment quality of issuers or calls by the issuers 
investment losses are also caused by writedowns due to impairments 
we do not engage in trading investments for profit 
therefore  gains or losses which occur in protecting the portfolio or its yield  or which result from events that are beyond our control  are only secondary to our core insurance operations of providing insurance coverage to policyholders 
realized gains and losses can be significant in relation to the earnings from core insurance operations  and as a result  can have a material positive or negative impact on net income 
the significant fluctuations caused by gains and losses can cause the period to period trends of net income not to be indicative of historical core operating results nor predictive of the future trends of core operations 
accordingly  they have no bearing on core insurance operations or segment results as we view operations 
for these reasons  and in line with industry practice  we remove the effects of realized gains and losses when evaluating overall insurance operating results 
the following table summarizes our tax effected realized gains losses by component for each of the years in the three year period ended december  analysis of realized gains losses  net of tax dollar amounts in thousands  except for per share data year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share investments sales called or tendered writedowns loss on redemption of debt other total written down due to other than temporary impairment

index to financial statements financial condition liquidity 
liquidity provides torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by its business operations and financial obligations 
our liquidity is primarily derived from three sources positive cash flow from operations  a portfolio of marketable securities  and a line of credit facility 
insurance subsidiary liquidity 
the operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs 
sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income 
cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments  commissions  administrative expenses  and taxes 
the funds to provide for policy benefits  the majority of which are paid in future periods  are invested primarily in long term fixed maturities to meet these long term obligations 
in addition to investment income  maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash 
excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company  subject to regulatory restriction 
the dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains 
the leading source of the excess cash is investment income 
however  due to our high underwriting margins and effective expense control  a significant portion of the excess cash comes from underwriting income 
parent company liquidity 
cash flows from the insurance subsidiaries are used to pay interest and principal repayments on parent company debt  operating expenses of the parent  and parent company dividends to torchmark shareholders 
in  the parent received million of dividends and transfers from its insurance subsidiaries  as compared with million in and million in the dividend included million of additional dividends available as a result of the sale of united investors 
including transfers from other subsidiaries and after paying debt obligations  shareholder dividends  and other expenses but before share repurchases  torchmark parent had excess operating cash flow in of approximately million  compared with million in including the million from the sale of united investors 
parent company cash flow in excess of its operating requirements is available for other corporate purposes  such as strategic acquisitions or share repurchases 
in  it is expected that the parent company will receive approximately million in dividends and transfers from subsidiaries  and that approximately million will be available as excess cash flow 
certain restrictions exist on the payment of these dividends 
for more information on the restrictions on the payment of dividends by subsidiaries  see the restrictions section of note shareholders equity in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
although these restrictions exist  dividend availability from subsidiaries historically has been sufficient for the cash flow needs of the parent company 
as additional liquidity  the parent held million of cash and short term investments at december   compared with million a year earlier 
the parent also had available a million receivable from subsidiaries at december  short term borrowings 
an additional source of parent company liquidity is a line of credit facility with a group of lenders which allows unsecured borrowings and stand by letters of credit up to million 
as of december   we had available million of additional borrowing capacity under this facility  as we also had a year earlier 
there have been no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the three years ended december  for detailed information about this line of credit facility  see the commercial paper section of note debt 
in summary  torchmark expects to have readily available funds for and the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility 
in the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed  the company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including  but not limited to  the issuance of additional debt  a short term credit facility  and intercompany borrowing 
consolidated liquidity 
consolidated net cash inflows provided from operations were million in  compared with million in and billion in in addition to cash inflows from operations  our companies have received million in investment calls and tenders and million of scheduled maturities or repayments during maturities  tenders  and calls totaled million in and million in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements our cash and short term investments were million at year end and million at year end additionally  we have a portfolio of marketable fixed and equity securities that are available for sale in the event of an unexpected need 
these securities had a fair value of billion at december  however  our strong cash flows from operations  investment maturities  and the availability of our credit line make any need to sell securities for liquidity unlikely 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and under the subcaption funded debt  torchmark had outstanding million par amount trust preferred securities at december   but these securities were redeemed during the capital trust liable for these securities was the legal entity responsible for the securities and facilitated the payment of dividends to shareholders 
the trust was an off balance sheet arrangement which we were required to deconsolidate in accordance with gaap rules  because the capital trust was considered to be a variable interest entity in which we had no variable interest 
while these liabilities were not on our consolidated balance sheets  they were represented by torchmark s junior subordinated debentures due to the trust in the amount of million which was on our balance sheet at december  under the caption due to affiliates 
as a part of its above mentioned credit facility  torchmark had outstanding million in stand by letters of credit at december  however  these letters are issued among our subsidiaries and have no impact on company obligations as a whole 
as of december   we had no other significant unconsolidated affiliates and no guarantees of the obligations of third party entities other than as described above 
all of our guarantees were guarantees of the performance of consolidated subsidiaries  as disclosed in note commitments and contingencies 
the following table presents information about future payments under our contractual obligations for the selected periods as of december  amounts in millions actual liability total payments less than one year one to three years four to five years more than five years fixed and determinable debt principal debt interest capital leases operating leases purchase obligations pension obligations future insurance obligations total funded debt is itemized in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements and includes short term commercial paper 
interest on debt is based on our fixed contractual obligations 
pension obligations are primarily liabilities in trust funds that are calculated in accordance with the terms of the pension plans 
they are offset by invested assets in the trusts  which are funded through periodic contributions by torchmark in a manner which will provide for the settlement of the obligations as they become due 
therefore  our obligations are offset by those assets when reported on torchmark s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   these pension obligations were million  but there were also assets of million in the pension entities 
the schedule of pension benefit payments covers ten years and is based on the same assumptions used to measure the pension obligations  except there is no interest assumption because the payments are undiscounted 
please refer to note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on pension obligations 
future insurance obligations consist primarily of estimated future contingent benefit payments on policies in force at december  these estimated payments were computed using assumptions for future mortality  morbidity and persistency 
the actual amount and timing of such payments may differ significantly from the estimated amounts shown 
management believes that the assets supporting the liability of billion at december   along with future premiums and investment income  will be sufficient to fund all future insurance obligations

index to financial statements capital resources 
torchmark s capital structure consists of short term debt the commercial paper facility described in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term funded debt  and shareholders equity 
as of december   our notes due have been reclassified from long term funded debt to short term debt because of its current maturity in august a complete analysis and description of long term debt issues outstanding is presented in note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of the long term funded debt was million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
as fully explained in note debt  we issued million principal amount of senior notes due in in september  for proceeds of million in a public offering 
however  million of the offering was acquired by torchmark insurance subsidiaries and was eliminated in consolidation  resulting in net proceeds after issue expenses to the consolidated group of million 
the majority of the million proceeds received by the parent were used to acquire family heritage as described in note acquisition 
the balance was invested to be used for the redemption of our senior notes that mature in august   or at an earlier time if opportunities to repurchase these notes become available  and for other corporate purposes 
as also discussed in note  we issued million principal amount of our junior subordinated debentures due in a september  public offering 
this issue resulted in net proceeds after issue expenses of million  and were used to redeem our trust originated preferred securities in the amount of million plus accrued dividends for a total cost of million 
also noted in note was our assumption of million of trust preferred securities in connection with our acquisition of family heritage 
these securities bear interest at a variable rate  the three month libor plus basis points  which is reset each quarter 
while these securities are callable by us at any time  we have no immediate plans to do so 
our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of at least of required regulatory capital under risk based capital rbc  a formula designed by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital 
the target is considered sufficient for the subsidiaries because of their strong reliable cash flows  the relatively low risk of their product mix  and because that ratio is in line with rating agency expectations for torchmark 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries in the aggregate had rbc ratios of approximately 
should we experience additional impairments and ratings downgrades in the future that cause the ratio to fall below  management has more than sufficient liquidity at the parent company to make additional contributions as necessary to maintain the ratios at or above 
as noted under the caption summary of operations in this report  we have an ongoing share repurchase program 
under this program  we acquired million shares at a cost of million in  million shares at a cost of million in  and million shares for million in the majority of purchased shares are retired each year 
please refer to the description of our share repurchase program under the caption summary of operations in this report 
torchmark has increased the dividend on its common shares over the past three years 
in the first quarter of  the dividend was increased from 
per share to 
per share and in the fourth quarter of  it was further increased to 
per share 
in the second quarter of  it was raised to 
per share and in the first quarter of  it was again increased to 
per share 
shareholders equity was billion at december   compared with billion at december  during the twelve months since december   shareholders equity was reduced by the million in share purchases under the repurchase program and another million to offset the dilution from stock option exercises  but has been increased by the million of net income  million from option exercises  and by after tax unrealized gains of million in the fixed maturity portfolio as conditions in financial markets have improved 
we plan to use excess cash as efficiently as possible in the future 
excess cash flow could be used for share repurchases  acquisitions  increases in shareholder dividends  investment in fixed maturities  or repayment of short term debt 
we will determine the best use of excess cash after ensuring that desired capital levels are maintained in our companies 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we maintain a significant available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to support our insurance policyholders liabilities 
current accounting guidance requires that we revalue our portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period 
the period to period changes in fair value  net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax  are reflected directly in shareholders equity 
changes in the fair value of the portfolio can result from changes in interest rates and liquidity in financial markets 
while invested assets are revalued  accounting rules do not permit interest bearing insurance policy liabilities to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner as that of assets  with changes in value applied directly to shareholders equity 
due to the size of our policy liabilities in relation to our shareholders equity  this inconsistency in measurement usually has a material impact on the reported value of shareholders equity 
if these liabilities were revalued in the same manner as the assets  the effect on equity would be largely offset 
fluctuations in interest rates cause undue volatility in the period to period presentation of our shareholders equity  capital structure  and financial ratios which would be essentially removed if interest bearing liabilities were valued in the same manner as assets 
from time to time  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio may be depressed as a result of bond market illiquidity which could result in a significant decrease in shareholders equity 
because of the long term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries  we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity 
as such  we do not expect to incur losses due to fluctuations in market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes and temporarily illiquid markets 
accordingly  our management  credit rating agencies  lenders  many industry analysts  and certain other financial statement users prefer to remove the effect of this accounting rule when analyzing our balance sheet  capital structure  and financial ratios 
the following tables present selected data related to our capital resources 
additionally  the tables present the effect of this accounting guidance on relevant line items  so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on torchmark s capital structure

this ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of debt and shareholders equity 
fasb guidance provides for an option which  if elected  would permit us to value our interest bearing policy liabilities and debt at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  unlike the accounting rule which permits us to account for changes in our available for sale bond portfolio through other comprehensive income  the guidance requires such changes to be recorded in earnings 
because both the size and duration of the investment portfolio do not match those attributes of our policyholder

torchmark s ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest requirements times interest earned was times in  compared with times in and times in this times interest earned ratio is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pre tax income from continuing operations and interest expense 
a discussion of our interest expense is included in the discussion of financing costs under the caption investments in this report 
financial strength ratings 
the financial strength of our major insurance subsidiaries is rated by standard poor s and a 
m 
best 
the following chart presents these ratings for our four largest insurance subsidiaries at december  standard poor s am best liberty aa a superior globe aa a superior united american aa a superior american income aa a superior am best states that it assigns an a superior rating to those companies which  in its opinion  have demonstrated superior overall performance when compared to the norms of the life health insurance industry 
a superior companies have a superior ability to meet their obligations to policyholders over a long period of time 
the aa financial strength rating category is assigned by standard poor s corporation to those insurers which have very strong financial security characteristics  differing only slightly from those rated higher 
the minus sign shows the relative standing within the major rating category 
other items litigation 
torchmark and its subsidiaries are subject to being named as parties to pending or threatened litigation  much of which involves punitive damage claims based upon allegations of agent misconduct at the insurance subsidiaries 
such punitive damage claims that are tried in alabama state courts may have the potential for significant adverse results since punitive damages in alabama are based upon the compensatory damages including mental anguish awarded and the discretion of the jury in awarding compensatory damages is not precisely defined 
additionally  it should be noted that our subsidiaries actively market insurance in the state of mississippi  a jurisdiction which is nationally recognized for large punitive damage verdicts 
this bespeaks caution since it is impossible to predict the likelihood or extent of punitive damages that may be awarded if liability is found in any given case 
based upon information presently available  and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to torchmark and its subsidiaries  contingent liabilities arising from threatened and pending litigation are not presently considered by us to be material 
for more information concerning litigation  please refer to note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies future policy benefits 
because of the long term nature of insurance contracts  our insurance companies are liable for policy benefit payments that will be made in the future 
the liability for future policy benefits is determined by standard actuarial procedures common to the life insurance industry 
the accounting policies for determining this liability are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
approximately of our liabilities for future policy benefits at december  were traditional insurance liabilities where the liability is determined as the present value of future benefits less the present value of the portion of the gross premium required to pay for such benefits 
the assumptions used in estimating the future benefits for this portion of business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in and are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts  except where there is a premium deficiency  as defined in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements under the caption future policy benefits 
otherwise  variability in the accrual of policy reserve liabilities after policy issuance is caused only by variability of the inventory of in force policies 
torchmark did not have a premium deficiency event for its traditional business during the three years ended december  the remaining portion of liabilities for future policy benefits pertains to business accounted for as deposit business  where the recorded liability is the fund balance attributable to the benefit of policyholders as determined by the policy contract at the financial statement date 
accordingly  there are no assumptions used to determine the future policy benefit liability for deposit business 
deferred acquisition costs 
certain costs of acquiring new business are deferred and recorded as an asset 
deferred acquisition costs eligible for deferral consist primarily of sales commissions and other underwriting costs related to the successful issuance of a new insurance contract as indicated in note significant accounting policies under the caption deferred acquisition costs in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
additionally  the cost of acquiring blocks of insurance business or insurance business through the purchase of other companies  known as the value of insurance purchased  is included in deferred acquisition costs 
our policies for accounting for deferred acquisition costs and the associated amortization are reported under the same caption in note approximately of our recorded amounts for deferred acquisition costs at december  were related to traditional products and are being amortized over the premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and estimated future gross premiums 
the projection assumptions for this business are set at the time of contract issue 
these assumptions are locked in at that time and  except where there is a loss recognition issue  are not revised for the lifetime of the contracts 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance is caused only by variability in premium volume 
we have not recorded a deferred acquisition cost loss recognition event for assets related to this business for any period in the three years ended december  the remaining of deferred acquisition costs pertain to deposit business for which deferred acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and estimated future gross profits 
these contracts are not subject to lock in 
the assumptions must be updated when actual experience or other evidence suggests that earlier estimates should be revised 
revisions related to our deposit business assets have not had a material impact on the amortization of deferred acquisition costs during the three years ended december  policy claims and other benefits payable 
this liability consists of known benefits currently payable and an estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
the estimate of unreported claims is based on prior experience and is made after careful evaluation of all information available to us 
however  the factors upon which these estimates are based can be subject to change from historical patterns 
factors involved include the litigation environment  regulatory mandates  and the introduction of policy types for which claim patterns are not well established  and medical trend rates and medical cost inflation as they affect our health claims 
changes in these estimates  if any  are reflected in the earnings of the period in which the adjustment is made 
we believe that the estimates used to produce the liability for claims and other benefits  including the estimate of unsubmitted claims  are the most appropriate 
table of contents 
index to financial statements under the circumstances 
however  there is no certainty that the resulting stated liability will be our ultimate obligation 
at this time  we do not expect any change in this estimate to have a material impact on earnings or financial position consistent with our historical experience 
valuation of fixed maturities 
we hold a substantial investment in high quality fixed maturities to provide for the funding of our future policy contractual obligations over long periods of time 
while these securities are generally expected to be held to maturity  they are classified as available for sale and are sold from time to time  primarily to manage risk 
we report this portfolio at fair value 
fair value is the price that we would expect to receive upon sale of the asset in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio is primarily affected by changes in interest rates in financial markets  having a greater impact on longer term maturities 
because of the size of our fixed maturity portfolio  small changes in rates can have a significant effect on the portfolio and the reported financial position of the company 
this impact is disclosed in basis point increments under the caption market risk sensitivity in this report 
however  as discussed under the caption financial condition in this report  we believe these unrealized fluctuations in value have no meaningful impact on our actual financial condition and  as such  we remove them from consideration when viewing our financial position and financial ratios 
at times  the values of our fixed maturities can also be affected by illiquidity in the financial markets 
illiquidity would contribute to a spread widening  and accordingly unrealized losses  on many securities that we would expect to be fully recoverable 
even though our fixed maturity portfolio is available for sale  we have the ability and intent to hold the securities until maturity as a result of our strong and stable cash flows generated from our insurance products 
considerable information concerning the policies  procedures  classification levels  and other relevant data concerning the valuation of our fixed maturity investments is presented in note significant accounting policies and in note investments under the captions fair value measurements in both notes 
impairment of investments 
we continually monitor our investment portfolio for investments that have become impaired in value  where fair value has declined below carrying value 
while the values of the investments in our portfolio constantly fluctuate due to market conditions  an other than temporary impairment charge is recorded only when a security has experienced a decline in fair market value which is deemed to be other than temporary 
the policies and procedures that we use to evaluate and account for impairments of investments are disclosed in note significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the discussions under the captions investments and realized gains and losses in this report 
while every effort is made to make the best estimate of status and value with the information available regarding an other than temporary impairment  it is difficult to predict the future prospects of a distressed or impaired security 
defined benefit pension plans 
we maintain funded defined benefit plans covering most full time employees 
we also have unfunded nonqualified defined benefit plans covering certain key and other employees 
our obligations under these plans are determined actuarially based on specified actuarial assumptions 
in accordance with gaap  an expense is recorded each year as these pension obligations grow due to the increase in the service period of employees and the interest cost associated with the passage of time 
these obligations are offset  at least in part  by the growth in value of the assets in the funded plans 
at december   our gross liability under these funded plans was million  but was offset by assets of million 
the actuarial assumptions used in determining our obligations for pensions include employee mortality and turnover  retirement age  the expected return on plan assets  projected salary increases  and the discount rate at which future obligations could be settled 
these assumptions have an important effect on the pension obligation 
a decrease in the discount rate or rate of return on plan assets will cause an increase in the pension obligation 
a decrease in projected salary increases will cause a decrease in this obligation 
small changes in assumptions may cause material differences in reported results for these plans 
while we have used our best efforts to determine the most reliable assumptions  given the information available from company experience  economic data  independent consultants and other sources  we cannot be certain that actual results will be the same as expected 
our discount rate  rate of return on assets  and projected salary increase assumptions are disclosed and the criteria used to determine those assumptions are discussed in note postretirement benefits in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions are reviewed annually and revised  if necessary  based on more current information available to us 
note also contains information about pension plan assets  investment policies  and other related data
