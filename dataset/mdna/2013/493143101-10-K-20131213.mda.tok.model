overview sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared with million for fiscal  while orders increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal we reported net earnings for fiscal of million  or per diluted share  compared with net earnings of  or per diluted share  for fiscal net earnings increased in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a million increase in gross profit  offset by higher operating expenses of million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal the increase in gross margins to in fiscal from in fiscal was due to a higher mix of higher margin automated system sales and the product mix within automated inspection systems  and more efficient factory utilization  partially offset by higher warranty and customer support costs due in part to the increase in net sales and million of acquisition related fair value adjustments to acquired inventory 
operating expenses increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the acquisition of visys  the results of which have been included since the acquisition date  february   higher commissions due to the increase in net sales  increased research and development expenses related to developing new technology solutions  and the increased expenses associated with amortization of intangible assets 
other expenses were  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year automated inspection systems sales increased  process systems sales were up  and parts and service sales increased in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
orders for automated inspection systems increased  process system orders decreased  and parts and service orders increased in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
export and international sales for the fiscal years ended september   and accounted for  and of net sales in each year  respectively 
while the company produced significantly improved operating results in fiscal  our major business still serves seasonal and cyclical industries  and it remains typical for order and backlog quantities to vary on a quarter by quarter basis 
while we have recently seen a softening in the european region  we remain positive regarding our overall international opportunities 
our acquisition of visys  completed on february   was a critical component of our long term strategy 
visys has brought new technology  expertise and chute fed solutions that complement our existing product portfolio 
the visys products have enabled us to add nuts and dried fruit as a new core market as well as expand our available product offerings and solutions in the processed fruit and vegetables and potato markets 
the visys team  now fully integrated within key  adds capabilities and skill sets that augment our already talented and experienced team 
in fiscal  we focused on our five strategic imperatives  which will continue in fiscal those five strategic imperatives are as follows developing and introducing new technology leading platforms and solutions  increasing global market share in our core markets through new products  focused regional sales strategies  and leveraging our integrated solutions capability  expanding into new high potential market adjacencies by leveraging new product platforms  continuing to strengthen and develop internal capabilities and third party partnerships necessary for industry leading solutions  and further strengthening a winning culture within key technology  driving our innovation architecture 
acquisition effective february   we completed the acquisition of visys nv visys  a belgian supplier of high end digital sensor based optical sorters 
we acquired of the outstanding shares of visys for approximately million  consisting of million in cash   shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
visys has been included in our operating results for the period from the date of acquisition 
further information regarding the acquisition of visys is contained in footnote to our consolidated financial statements as of september  license and distribution agreements in july  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with evk di kerschhaggl gmbh and insort gmbh to deploy chemical imaging technology for potato processing applications and to integrate new hyperspectral developments into our automated inspection systems  and an exclusive distribution agreement to market insort complementary sorting solutions exclusively in north america and to strategic specified customers worldwide 
these partnerships are expected to enhance our ability to offer high performance digital sorting technologies in the potato industry  and facilitate our development of next generation hyperspectral sorters for a variety of food processing applications 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified our critical accounting policies  the application of which may materially affect our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require management judgment to make estimates and assumptions in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates which management believes have the most significant effect on the financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition allowances for doubtful accounts valuation of inventories long lived assets allowances for warranties accounting for income taxes management has discussed the development  selection and related disclosures of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
additionally  we sell our goods on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically shipping point  port of loading or port of discharge  depending on the final destination of the goods 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all criteria are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which occurs either upon shipment by us or upon receipt by customers at the location specified in the terms of sale 
sales of system upgrades are recognized as revenue upon completion of the conversion of the customer s existing system when this conversion occurs at the customer site 
certain other  less frequent  equipment sales are recognized as revenue upon completion of installation at the customer site 
revenue earned from services maintenance  installation support  and repairs is recognized ratably over the contractual period or as the services are performed 
if any contract provides for both equipment and services multiple deliverables  the sales price is allocated to the various elements based on the relative selling price 
each element is then evaluated for revenue recognition based on the previously described criteria 
we typically have a very limited number of contracts with multiple deliverables and they are not material to the financial statements 
our sales arrangements provide for no other significant post shipment obligations 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  we defer revenue recognition 
in the event of revenue deferral  the sale value is not recorded as revenue to us  accounts receivable are reduced by any related amounts owed by the customer  and the cost of the goods or services deferred is carried in inventory 
in addition  we periodically evaluate whether an allowance for sales returns is necessary 
historically  we have experienced few sales returns 
we account for cash consideration such as sales incentives that are given to customers or resellers as a reduction of revenue rather than as an operating expense unless an identified benefit is received for which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that revenue recognition is a critical accounting estimate because our terms of sale vary significantly  and management exercises judgment in determining whether to recognize or defer revenue based on those terms 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
management exercises judgment within the parameters of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
at september   we had invoiced million  compared to million at september   for which we have not recognized revenue 
allowances for doubtful accounts 
we have established allowances for doubtful accounts for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  doubtful accounts based on credit profiles of customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and customers historical payment patterns 
factors that affect collectability of receivables include general economic or political factors in certain countries that affect the ability of customers to meet current obligations 
we actively manage our credit risk by utilizing an independent credit rating and reporting service  by requiring certain percentages of down payments  and by requiring secured forms of payment for customers with uncertain credit profiles or located in certain countries 
forms of secured payment could include irrevocable letters of credit  bank guarantees  third party leasing arrangements or ex im bank guarantees  each utilizing uniform commercial code filings  or the like  with governmental entities where possible 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management judgment in making assumptions relative to customer or general economic factors that are outside our control 
as of september   the balance sheet included allowances for doubtful accounts of  as compared to  at september  amounts charged to bad debt expense for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
actual charges to the allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal and were  and  respectively 
if we experience actual bad debt expense in excess of estimates  or if estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  the carrying value of accounts receivable would decrease and charges for bad debts would increase  resulting in decreased net earnings 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
our inventory includes purchased raw materials  manufactured components  purchased components  service and repair parts  work in process  finished goods and demonstration equipment 
write downs for excess and obsolete inventories are made after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks are our purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles and the associated product support 
we actively manage our exposure to inventory valuation risks by maintaining low safety stocks and minimum purchase lots  utilizing just in time purchasing practices  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors ranging from purchasing to sales to production to after sale support 
at september   cumulative inventory adjustments to lower of cost or market totaled million compared to million as of september  amounts charged to expense to record inventory at lower of cost or market for fiscal and were million and million  respectively 
actual charges to the cumulative inventory adjustments upon disposition or sale of inventory were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles are adversely different from those estimated by management  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs  and a decrease to gross margins 
long lived assets 
we regularly review all of our long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the total of projected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of these assets  an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets is recorded 
in addition  goodwill is reviewed based on its fair value at least annually 
as of september   we held million of long lived assets  net of depreciation and amortization 
there were no material changes in our long lived assets that would result in an adjustment of the carrying value for these assets 
estimates of future cash flows arising from the utilization of these long lived assets and estimated useful lives associated with the assets are critical to the assessment of recoverability and fair values 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generated throughout the lives of several product lines over extended periods of time  future results of operations  and market multiples used in valuation models  and the potential effect that recognizing an impairment could have on the assets reported on our balance sheet and the potential material adverse effect on reported earnings or loss 
changes in these estimates could result in a determination of asset impairment  which would result in a reduction to the carrying value and a reduction to net earnings in the affected period 
allowances for warranties 
our products are covered by standard warranty plans included in the price of the products ranging from days to five years  depending upon the product and contractual terms of sale 
the majority of the warranty periods are for one year or less 
we establish allowances for warranties for specifically identified  as well as anticipated  warranty claims based on contractual terms  product conditions and actual warranty experience by product line 
our products include both manufactured and purchased components and  therefore  warranty plans include third party sourced parts which may not be covered by the third party manufacturer s warranty 
we actively manage our quality program by using a structured product introduction plan  process monitoring techniques utilizing statistical process controls  vendor quality metrics  and feedback loops to communicate warranty claims to designers and engineers for remediation in future production 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to allowances for warranties is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to significant fluctuation period to period due to the requirement for management to make assumptions about future warranty claims relative to potential unknown issues arising in both existing and new products  which assumptions are derived from historical trends of known or resolved issues  and risks associated with third party supplied components being manufactured using processes that we do not control 
as of september   the balance sheet included warranty reserves of million  while million of warranty charges were incurred during the fiscal year then ended  compared to warranty reserves of million as of september  and warranty charges of million for the fiscal year then ended 
if our actual warranty costs are higher than estimates  future warranty plan coverages are different  or estimates are adversely adjusted in future periods  reserves for warranty expense would need to increase  warranty expense would increase and gross margins would decrease 
accounting for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of management judgment 
the quarterly provision for income taxes is based partially upon estimates of pre tax financial accounting income for the full year and is affected by various differences between financial accounting income and taxable income 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in management s judgment  when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
at september   we had valuation reserves of approximately  for deferred tax assets for capital loss carryforwards and changes in the carrying value of our investment in proditec  and offsetting amounts for foreign deferred tax assets and us deferred tax liabilities  primarily related to net operating loss carry forwards in the foreign jurisdictions that we believe will not be utilized during the carryforward periods 
during fiscal  we recorded net additional valuation reserves of  related to capital loss carryforwards and  as part of the acquisition of visys related to net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we reversed offsetting amounts of approximately  of valuation reserves for foreign deferred tax assets and us deferred tax liabilities related to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in europe in fiscal as these were offsetting amounts  these changes had no effect on net earnings 
during fiscal  we recorded net additional valuation reserves of  related to capital loss carryforwards 
in addition  we recorded offsetting amounts of approximately million of valuation reserves for foreign deferred tax assets and us deferred tax liabilities related to net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions that we believe will not be utilized during the carryforward periods 
we also reversed offsetting amounts of approximately  of valuation reserves for chinese deferred tax assets and us deferred tax liabilities related to net operating loss carry forwards that were utilized in the foreign jurisdiction 
as these were all offsetting amounts  these changes had no effect on net earnings 
during fiscal  we recorded  of valuation reserves related to net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions offset by us deferred tax liabilities and reversed  of valuation reserves for capital loss carryforwards that were utilized to offset capital gains on our corporate income tax return 
there were no other valuation allowances at september  due to anticipated utilization of all the deferred tax assets as we believe we will have sufficient taxable income to utilize these assets 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation 
these tax jurisdictions include federal  state and various international tax jurisdictions 
potential income tax exposures include potential challenges of various tax credits and deductions  and issues specific to state and local tax jurisdictions 
exposures are typically settled primarily through audits within these tax jurisdictions  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause our management to believe a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
at september   we had reserves of  for estimated tax exposures 
during fiscal and  there were no significant changes in these estimates 
management believes that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures  however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because it relies on significant management judgment in making assumptions relative to temporary and permanent timing differences of tax effects  estimates of future earnings  prospective application of changing tax laws in multiple jurisdictions  and the resulting ability to utilize tax assets at those future dates 
if our operating results were to fall short of expectations  thereby affecting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of the valuation allowance required to be included in the financial statements in any given period 
establishing or increasing a valuation allowance would reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  increase tax expense and reduce net earnings 
in fiscal  the existing research and development tax credit was retroactively renewed and extended to december  due to this change in tax law  the company recorded approximately  of additional research and development credits in fiscal related to research and development expenditures incurred during fiscal the research and development credit was effective for the company for only the first fiscal quarter of prior to its expiration date 
similarly  in fiscal  an additional  of research and development credits were recorded which related to r d expenditures in fiscal the research and development credit expires december  and  as of the date of this report  has not been renewed

the increase in net sales occurred most significantly in north america and europe  partially offset by decreases in net sales in latin america 
sales in our automated inspection systems product line increased by to million in fiscal  accounting for of total revenues  compared to million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the increase in automated inspection system sales was principally in the potato market  as well as other food markets  offset by decreases in the processed fruit and vegetable and fresh cut markets 
the increase in automated inspection system sales occurred in the adr  tegra  veo  verisym and upgrade product lines  partially offset by decreases in optyx  raptor  manta and tobacco sorter product lines 
process systems sales in fiscal were million a increase from the million reported for fiscal sales of process systems accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in process systems sales related primarily to vibratory products in europe and other process system equipment  partially offset by a decrease in rotary sizing and grading systems and third party equipment

orders increased most significantly in the north american region  particularly in the potato market 
automated inspection systems backlog was million at the end of fiscal  essentially the same as a year ago 
the backlog for automatic inspection systems increased in the manta  tegra  tobacco sorter and visys product lines offset by decreases in the adr  optyx and raptor product lines 
backlog for process systems was down million  or  to million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the same time a year ago 
the decrease in the backlog for process systems was primarily driven by a decrease in vibratory products  third party equipment  and vibratory equipment in europe 
backlog by product line at september  was automated inspection systems  process systems  and parts and service  compared to automated inspection systems  process systems  and parts and service at september  gross profit increased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or and of net sales  respectively 
the principal reasons for the increase in the gross profit margin percentage were a higher mix of higher margin automated inspection system sales and the product mix within automated inspection systems and more efficient factory utilization  partially offset by higher warranty and customer support costs due in part to the increase in net sales and million of acquisition related fair market value adjustments to acquired inventory 
gross margins are expected to be significantly lower in the first quarter of fiscal as compared to the first quarter of fiscal  and gross margin percentages for the first quarter of fiscal are expected to be adversely affected by unfavorable plant utilization 
research and development expense increased million to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal in fiscal  there was an increase in expenses related to developing new technology solutions  as well as the inclusion of the research and development expense of visys since the acquisition date 
sales and marketing expense in fiscal increased to million compared to million spent in fiscal as a percentage of sales  sales expense decreased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal the primary reasons for the sales and marketing expense increase in spending were increased net sales  higher commissions due to the increase in net sales  the inclusion of the sales and marketing expenses of visys since the acquisition date  and increased sales incentive compensation 
general and administrative expense in fiscal was million or of sales for the year  compared to million or of sales for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in spending were the inclusion of visys since the acquisition date   of acquisition related expenses  and incentive compensation expenses 
operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal are anticipated to decrease modestly as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal other income and expense was an expense of  for fiscal compared to  of expense for fiscal in fiscal  we recognized foreign exchange losses of  net of the effects of forward contracts settled during the year  compared with exchange gains of  in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded  of expense related to accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments reclassified from other comprehensive income to the results of operations 
the effective tax rate for the company was a tax expense rate of in fiscal compared to a tax expense rate of in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably affected by the domestic production deduction and the research and development tax credit offset by other permanent deductions 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was affected by the research and development credits recorded in fiscal  including  of additional research and development tax credits related to fiscal recorded in fiscal due to changes in tax law during fiscal to retroactively renew the research and development tax credit 
the ratios were also affected by the relative size of individual items compared to net earnings for fiscal  which was significantly higher than net earnings in fiscal net earnings in fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the principal reasons for the increase in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal were higher net sales and gross profit margins  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
as a result of our lower fourth quarter ending backlog and anticipated shipment schedule  the company expects that the results of operations will be significantly lower in the first quarter of fiscal than in the first quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from the million reported for fiscal international sales for fiscal were of net sales compared to in the corresponding prior year period 
the decrease in net sales in north america and europe was partially offset by increases in net sales in latin america and the asia pacific regions 
sales in our automated inspection systems product line decreased by to million in fiscal  accounting for of total revenues  compared to million in fiscal  or of total revenues 
the decrease in automated inspection system sales was due to a slow period for new capital investments  particularly in the potato market  as well as the effects of product competition 
the decrease in automated inspection system sales was across most major product lines with the exception of the recently released veo system and manta product lines 
process systems sales in fiscal were million  a increase from the million reported for fiscal sales of process systems accounted for of total revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in process systems sales related primarily to vibratory products  rotary sizing and grading systems and third party equipment  partially offset by a decrease in vibratory product sales in europe

the backlog decrease for automatic inspection systems was across almost all product lines 
backlog for process systems was up million  or  to million at the end of fiscal compared to million at the same time a year ago 
the increase in the backlog for process systems was primarily driven by an increase in vibratory products  rotary sizers and graders  and vibratory equipment in europe  partially offset by a decrease in fresh cut products 
backlog by product line at september  was automated inspection systems  process systems  and parts and service  compared to automated inspection systems  process systems  and parts and service at september  gross profit decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or and of net sales  respectively 
the principal reasons for the million decrease in gross profit were a higher mix of lower margin process system sales and the product mix within automated inspection systems  continued price competition  partially offset by lower warranty and customer support costs and the effect of cost reduction initiatives 
our growth strategy related to integrated product offerings may reduce the gross margin percentages in future periods to the extent products purchased from others are integrated into our product offerings 
research and development expense increased million to million  or of sales  in fiscal from million  or of sales  in fiscal in fiscal  there was an increase in expenses related to strategic initiatives for developing new technology solutions for the marketplace 
sales and marketing expense in fiscal decreased to million compared to million spent in fiscal as a percentage of sales  sales expense decreased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease in spending were lower internal sales and marketing personnel related costs due to cost reduction initiatives  decreased trade show and promotional costs  and lower commissions due to the decrease in net sales

net earnings in fiscal were  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the principal reasons for the decrease in earnings for fiscal compared to fiscal were lower net sales and gross profit margins  increased research and development expenses  partially offset by lower sales expenses and favorable changes in the components of other income and expense 
liquidity and capital resources fiscal for fiscal  net cash decreased by million to million on september  compared to million on september  we generated million in cash from operating activities  used million in investing activities and consumed million in financing activities 
the net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal of million included net earnings for the year of million  non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of million  non cash share based payments of million  offset by increases of million in deferred taxes due to the timing of deductions for tax purposes 
non cash working capital at september  decreased from the same time last year  providing million of cash 
the major changes in current assets and liabilities in fiscal that were sources of cash were a million reduction of inventory due to lower backlog and inventory requirements  and a million increase in accrued payroll liabilities due to the timing of payroll and timing of payments for increased commissions and increased sales and other incentive compensation  and a million increase in customer support and warranty costs accrued due to the increase in net sales 
these sources of cash were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million due to the timing of shipments during the last fiscal quarter of and related timing of collections  decreases in customer deposits of million related to the decreased backlog at fiscal year end  the timing of orders received in the last fiscal quarter of and related timing of customer down payments received 
the changes in working capital in fiscal reflects normal variations in our operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we have assessed our exposure to market risks for our financial instruments and have determined that our exposures to such risks are generally limited to those affected by the value of the us dollar compared to the euro and to a lesser extent the australian dollar  mexican peso  and singapore dollar 
the terms of sales to european customers are typically denominated in euros 
we expect that our standard terms of sale to international customers  other than those in europe  will continue to be denominated in us dollars  although as we expand our operations in australia and latin america  transactions denominated in the local currencies of these countries may increase 
as of september   management estimates that a change in foreign exchange rates would affect net earnings before taxes by approximately  on an annual basis as a result of the conversion to us dollars of cash  accounts receivable  loans to foreign subsidiaries  and sales or other contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
these changes would positively affect net earnings if the us dollar weakens on world markets and negatively affect net earnings if the us dollar strengthens on world markets 
we assess our currency exchange risk and may enter into forward contracts to minimize such risk 
at september   we held a day forward contract for million million 
as of september   the euro gained approximately in value against the us dollar compared to its value at september  during the twelve month period ended september   changes in the value of the euro against the us dollar ranged between a gain and a loss as compared to the value at september  most other relevant foreign currencies lost in value against the us dollar during fiscal the effect of these fluctuations on our operations and financial results in fiscal were translation adjustments of  net of income tax  were recognized as a component of comprehensive income as a result of converting the euro denominated balance sheets of key technology bv and suplusco holding bv and visys bv into bv dollars  and to a lesser extent  the australian dollar balance sheets of key technology australia pty ltd  the peso balance sheet of productos key mexicana  and the singapore dollar balance sheet of key technology asia pacific pte 
ltd 
foreign exchange losses of  net of the effects of forward contracts settled during the year  were recognized in the other income and expense section of the consolidated statement of operations as a result of conversion of euro and other foreign currency denominated receivables  intercompany loans  and cash carried on the balance sheet of the us operations  as well as the result of the conversion of other non functional currency receivables  payables and cash carried on the balance sheets of the european  australian  singapore and mexican operations 
when the us dollar weakens on the world markets  our market and economic outlook for international sales could be favorably affected as products sold to international customers become relatively less expensive to those customers 
conversely  a relatively stronger us dollar makes our us manufactured goods more expensive to international customers when denominated in us dollars or potentially less profitable to us when denominated in a foreign currency 
on the other hand  materials or components imported into the us may be less expensive 
our netherlands based subsidiary transacts business primarily in euros and does not have significant exports to the u 
s  but does import a significant portion of its products from its us based parent company 
our belgian based subsidiary also transacts business primarily in euros and is expected to have significant exports to the us based parent company 
interest rate risk 
under our domestic credit facilities  we may borrow at either a the lender s prime rate or prime less basis points or b at bba libor plus or basis points depending on our achievement of a specified financial ratio 
our netherlands subsidiary may borrow on our netherlands credit facility at the lenders prime rate plus basis points 
our belgian subsidiary may borrow on our belgian credit facility at the lender prime rate plus 
at september   we had no borrowings under these arrangements 
during the year ended september   interest rates applicable to these variable rate credit facilities ranged from to 
at september   the rate was on its domestic credit facility and on our netherlands credit facility and on our belgian credit facility based on the lowest of the available alternative rates 
our mortgage on our headquarters facility bears interest at the bba libor plus basis points  but we simultaneously entered into an interest rate swap agreement with the lender to fix the interest rate a 
long term fixed borrowings at our belgian subsidiary bear interest rates ranging from to 
as of september   management estimate that a basis point change in these interest rates would not affect net income before taxes because we had no borrowings outstanding under our variable interest rate credit facilities and the interest rate swap effectively converts our variable rate mortgage to a fixed rate mortgage
