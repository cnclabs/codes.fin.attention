item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations this annual report on form k contains restatements of our and financial statements 
the restatements relate to an error in the valuation analysis on the goodwill of our bank of kansas subsidiary 
a review of the valuation analysis resulted in a non cash impairment charge of million of goodwill at year end that was not previously reported 
as a result of the reduction in goodwill at year end  our net income for is reduced by million  from million to million 
total assets and shareholders equity at december  are reduced by million to end at billion and million  respectively 
the effect of the prior period adjustments to total assets and shareholders equity are reflected in the subsequent and financial statements 
the following discussion and analysis presents significant factors affecting our financial condition as of december  and december  and results of operations for the year ended december   december  restated  and december  restated 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto  and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information that is subject to change 
certain policies inherently rely more on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
management is required to use estimates  assumptions  and judgments when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation allowance to be established  or when an asset or liability must be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when readily available 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note summary of significant accounting and reporting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  estimates  assumptions  and judgments underlying those amounts  management has identified the allowance for loan losses  goodwill and other intangible assets  and income tax accounting policies to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revisions as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting asc  contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable  and asc  receivables subsequent measurement  which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that we will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan s contractual terms 
the allowance determination process requires significant judgment 
estimates of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts that actually occur 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by us  periodically review the loan portfolio and the allowance 
these reviews may result in additional provisions based on the agencies judgments based upon information available at the time of each examination 
because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial mortgage and commercial real estate construction loans with relatively large balances  the unexpected deterioration of one or a few of such loans may cause a significant increase in the provision for loan losses and nonperforming assets  and may lead to material increases in charge offs and the provision for loan losses in future periods 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance is in accordance with regulatory guidelines and gaap  as described in provision for loan losses on page and in note summary of significant accounting and reporting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an impairment test at least annually and more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units compared with its carrying value 
we define reporting units as a level below each of its operating segments for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed 
as of december   we have eight reporting units 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of a reporting unit  a second test is completed comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value to measure the amount of impairment 
other identifiable intangible assets are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years expected to be benefited  which we believe are up to ten years 
these amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment if circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable based on a comparison to fair value 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax asset is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence 
see note taxes on income in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information

net income available to common shareholders for decreased million compared to the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in provision for loan losses and a million increase in noninterest expense  both due to the sale of nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate during the fourth quarter of  a decrease in net interest income of million  and a decrease in noninterest income of million  offset in part by a million decrease in income tax expense 
details of the changes in various components of net income are further discussed below 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings  which are used to fund those assets 
net interest income is our largest source of revenue representing of total revenue in net interest margin is net interest income as a percentage of average earning assets for the period 
net interest income and net interest margin increase or decrease as a result of changes in the levels of interest rates  the volume and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the percentage of interest earning assets funded by noninterest bearing funding sources 
the federal reserve board influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by many financial institutions 
our loan portfolio is significantly affected by changes in the prime interest rate 
the prime interest rate  which is the rate offered on loans to borrowers with strong credit  has been at since our loan portfolio is also affected  to a lesser extent  by changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
at december   the one month and three month us dollar libor rates were and  respectively  while at december  the rates were and  respectively  and at december  the rates were and  respectively 
the intended federal fund rate  which is the cost of immediately available overnight funds  fluctuates in a similar manner to the prime interest rate 
it has been at or below since net interest income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million earned in net interest margin was for the year ended december   a decrease of ten basis points from net interest income for was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million earned in net interest margin was for the year ended december   an increase of seven basis points from the decline in net interest income for and was due to the decrease in interest earning assets  primarily loans  and the continued repricing of existing loans and deposits as interest rates remain at historical lows 
the yield on noncovered loans increased to for from for as a result of the reduction of nonaccrual loans related to the fourth quarter sale of nonperforming assets 
interest rate spread  which represents the difference between the rate earned on interest earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was for  compared to for  and for we have seen growth in noninterest bearing deposit accounts  which are an alternative funding source to interest bearing deposits and other borrowings 
the average balance of noninterest bearing deposit accounts increased to million in from million in and million in for further analysis of asset sensitivity please see tables showing the effects of changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest related assets and liabilities on page of this report and the discussion of quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on page of this report

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount of expense that  based on our judgment  is required to maintain the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based upon the inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the loan loss provision for a period is based solely upon the amount needed to cause the allowance to reach the level deemed appropriate  after the effects of net charge offs for the period 
net charge offs were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  included in net charge offs was million resulting from the fourth quarter sale of nonperforming assets 
the provisions for loan losses was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  included in the provision for loan losses was million resulting from the fourth quarter sale of nonperforming assets

service charges and fees decreased million  or  in as a result of decreased overdraft charges offset in part by increased brokerage fees and decreased amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
other noninterest income other noninterest income includes rent income and other miscellaneous income items 
gain on sales of loans gain on sales of loans includes the net gains recognized from the sale of mortgage loans and other commercial loans that are classified as held for sale 
for  the increase relates to our increased mortgage lending activity during the year 
for  the decrease was the result of reduced sales of student loans and decreased sales of mortgage loans 
gain on sales calls of investment securities the gain on sales or calls of investment securities was primarily the result of a single security held at cost 
the gains on sales of investment securities were the result of the sale of investment securities during those years 
there were no investment securities sold in noninterest expense noninterest expense was million for  a decrease of million  or  from noninterest expense was million for  an increase of  or  million from change change as restated dollars in thousands from from salaries and employee benefits occupancy fdic and other insurance other real estate  net provision for unfunded loan commitments other general and administrative total noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits remained flat for and the number of full time equivalent employees decreased from at the beginning of the year to as of december  as of december   the number of full time equivalent employees increased to from at the beginning of the year 
occupancy occupancy expense decreased million  or  in and million  or  in primarily due to decreased depreciation expense and decreased building rental expense 
fdic and other insurance our bank subsidiaries pay deposit insurance premiums to the fdic based on assessment rates 
in  the decrease from prior year is primarily the result of the decrease in assets  which is the basis for the premium calculation  and the decrease in the assessment rates 
in  the fdic began assessing insurance premiums based on average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity 
the decrease in fdic and other insurance expense for is due to lower assessments 
other real estate  net the million decrease in other real estate expense for is primarily due to the fourth quarter sales 
other real estate was million at december   million at december   and million at december  the other real estate expense includes million resulting from the fourth quarter sale of nonperforming assets 
provision for unfunded loan commitments the provision for unfunded loan commitments is computed using a methodology similar to that used to determine the allowance for loan losses  modified to take into account the probability of a drawdown on the commitment 
other general and administrative other general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  primarily due to lower collections costs and legal fees  partially offset by the prior year settlement of oklahoma state tax claims for less than the amount accrued 
the decrease in of million  or  is primarily a result of the million impairment of goodwill for the kansas segment and the settlement of oklahoma state tax claims for less than the amount accrued of million  offset in part by increased loan collection costs of million

these business segments were identified through the products and services that are offered within each segment and the geographic area they serve 
portfolio loans are allocated based upon the state of the borrower or the location of the real estate in the case of real estate loans 
loans included in the out of market segment are portfolio loans attributable to states other than oklahoma  texas  or kansas and primarily consist of healthcare and commercial real estate credits 
these out of state loans are administered by offices in oklahoma  texas  or kansas 
the contribution of the oklahoma banking segment increased million in as a result of an million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a million decrease in noninterest expense  offset in part by a million decrease in net interest income and a million increase in income tax expense 
the contribution of the oklahoma banking segment decreased million in as a result of a million increase in the provision for loan losses and a million increase in noninterest expense  offset in part by a million decrease in income tax expense 
the contribution of the texas banking segment increased million in as a result of a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a million decrease in noninterest expense  offset in part by a million increase in income tax expense and a million decrease in net interest income

the contribution of the out of market segment increased by million in primarily as a result of a million decrease in the provision for loan losses and a million decrease in noninterest expense  offset in part by a million increase in income tax expense and a million decrease in net interest income 
the out of market segment decreased by million in primarily as a result of a million increase in the provision for loan losses  a million increase in noninterest expense  and a million decrease in net interest income  offset in part by a million decrease in income tax expense 
at december   our eleven oklahoma offices accounted for million in loans  or of total portfolio loans  our five texas offices accounted for million in loans  or of total portfolio loans  our seven kansas offices accounted for million in loans  or of total portfolio loans  and our out of market segment accounted for million in loans  or of total portfolio loans 
the secondary market segment contributed net income of million and million in and  respectively 
the increase is primarily a result of increased noninterest income from the increased sales of loans held for sale 
for and  the other operations segment  which includes our funds management unit  incurred a loss of million and million  respectively 
the value of funds provided and cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating segments are internally priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar duration 
the oklahoma banking  texas banking  kansas banking  and out of market segments provide the majority of consolidated net interest income and net earnings  and for the year ended december  accounted for approximately billion  or  of total assets 
the segment disclosures are based upon a number of assumptions and allocations of expense 
we allocate resources and evaluate performance of our segments after allocation of funds  indirect expenses  taxes  and capital costs 
capital is assigned to each of the segments using a risk based capital pricing methodology that assigns capital ratios by asset  deposit  or revenue category based on credit risk  interest rate risk  market risk  operational risk  and liquidity risk factors 
taxes on income the income tax expense for totaled million  compared to income tax benefit of million for and income tax expense for of million 
the income tax expense benefit fluctuates in relation to pre tax income levels 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we monitor our deferred tax assets for realizability  which totaled million at december  we consider the cumulative three year pre tax operating results as well as timing  nature  and amount of future taxable income  taxable income within the carryback and carryforward periods  and the reversal of taxable temporary differences as well as future events and uncertainties in making our determination of the realization of our net deferred tax asset 
after evaluating all positive and negative evidence available at december   we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax benefits and that a valuation allowance is not needed 
total assets our total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  after decreasing by million  or  between december  and december  the decline in assets in was primarily attributable to the million  or  decrease in total loans and the million  or  decrease in other assets  offset in part by the increase in our investment securities portfolio by million  or 
investment securities portfolio we maintain an investment securities portfolio consisting of securities issued by us government sponsored entities  state and political subdivisions  mortgage backed  asset backed securities  and other investments 
mortgage backed securities consist of agency securities underwritten and guaranteed by government national mortgage association ginnie mae  federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  and federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian 
asset backed securities are collateralized by student loans 
investment securities assigned to the available for sale portfolio are generally used to supplement our liquidity  provide a prudent yield  and provide collateral for public deposits and other borrowing facilities 
unrealized net gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as an adjustment to equity  net of taxes  but are not reflected in our current earnings 
if management determines that any impairment in any available for sale security is other than temporary  a securities loss will be recognized as a charge to earnings 
if a security is sold  any gain or loss is recorded as a credit or charge to earnings and the equity adjustment is reversed 
at december   we held million in securities classified as available for sale with an unrealized gain of million  million net of taxes  related to these securities included in shareholders equity 
investment securities assigned to the held to maturity portfolio earn a prudent yield  provide liquidity from maturities and paydowns  and provide collateral to pledge for federal  state  and local government deposits and other borrowing facilities 
the held to maturity investment portfolio at december  included million in fixed rate securities 
if management determines any impairment in any held to maturity security is other than temporary  a securities loss will be recognized as a charge to earnings

maturities of mortgage backed securities are based on expected maturities 
expected maturities differ from contractual maturities because borrowers of the underlying mortgages may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties

at december  and  loans to individuals and businesses in the healthcare industry totaled million  or  and million  or  of noncovered loans  respectively 
the decline in loans in was due in part to the change in our lending focus away from larger average size loans and a refocus to our primary markets

included in noncovered nonaccrual loans as of december  are six collateral dependent lending relationships with aggregate principal balances of approximately million and related impairment reserves of million which were established based on recent financials and appraisal values obtained 
five of these lending relationships were secured by commercial real estate 
included in noncovered nonaccrual loans as of december  are five collateral dependent lending relationships with aggregate principal balances of approximately million and related impairment reserves of million which were established based on recent financials and appraisal values obtained 
four of these lending relationships were secured by commercial real estate 
noncovered nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period 
the performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment  economic conditions  collateral values  or factors particular to the borrower 
no assurance can be given that additional increases in noncovered nonaccrual loans will not occur in the future 
performing loans considered potential problem loans  loans which are not included in the past due  nonaccrual  or restructured categories  but for which known information about possible credit problems cause management to be uncertain as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms  amounted to approximately million at december   compared to million at december  included are million and million  respectively  of covered potential problem loans  which are subject to protection under the loss share agreements with the fdic 
loans may be monitored by management and reported in potential problem loans for an extended period of time during which management continues to be uncertain as to the ability of certain borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
these loans are subject to continued management attention and are considered by management in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses 
management strives to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming 
at any time  however  there are loans included in the portfolio that will result in losses to us but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans 
because the loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans with relatively large balances  the unexpected deterioration of one or a few of such loans may cause a significant increase in nonperforming assets  the provision for loan losses  and charge offs 
we began with continued high levels of nonperforming and potential problem assets 
in the spring of  we reorganized and took actions intended to strengthen the credit  loan review  and workout functions 
during the year  we had success in resolving some credits  but downgrades and new problem assets  mainly driven by real estate appraisal decreases with respect to collateral dependent loans  kept the total levels of unresolved credits unsatisfactorily high 
the levels significantly affected our earnings 
the board of directors carefully considered the potential costs and benefits of various alternatives to us and our shareholders  in consultation with financial and legal advisors and management 
management and the board of directors concluded that a sale of assets in the near term was in the best interests of our shareholders 
based on this determination  we sold nonperforming loans  potential problem loans  and other real estate with a carrying value before transfer to assets held for sale  of approximately million  and sold related other loans with a carrying value before transfer to assets held for sale of million during the fourth quarter of the loans were transferred to loans held for sale at fair values 
the actual sale price reflected a bulk sale discount  which resulted in charge offs of million at the time of transfer 
the sales completed in the fourth quarter of resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the results for the year ended december  include a provision for loan losses of million and a fair value adjustment in other real estate expenses of million in connection with the fourth quarter sales 
the provision expense was calculated in accordance with our standard methodology and was based on the amount needed to replenish the allowance for loan losses back to the required level for the remaining loan portfolio 
as of september   the assets sold were loans with an aggregate fair value of million and other real estate properties with an aggregate fair value of million 
carrying value fair value net sales price dollars in thousands loans collectively evaluated for impairment loans individually evaluated for impairment with a specific reserve no specific reserve other real estate total carrying value loans were reported at the principal balance outstanding net of the unamortized deferred loan fees 
the carrying value of loans specifically evaluated for impairment of million was prior to deducting specific reserves of million 
other real estate was carried at fair value less estimated costs to sell the asset 
fair value fair value of loans was estimated by discounting the cash flows using risks inherent in the loan category and interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms and credit risks or fair values of the underlying collateral if repayment was expected solely from collateral for each asset sold on a standalone basis in an orderly transaction 
the fair value of the other real estate was primarily based on the appraisal value of the underlying collateral 
allowance for loan losses we make provisions for loan losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level we determine is appropriate 
the amount of the allowance is based on careful  continuous review and evaluation of the loan portfolio and ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with regulatory guidelines and gaap 
see allowance for loan losses in note summary of significant accounting and reporting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our allowance for loan losses methodology 
based upon this methodology  management established an allowance of million  or of total noncovered portfolio loans  at december   compared to an allowance of million  or of total noncovered portfolio loans  at december  this represents an increase in the allowance of million  or 
changes in the amount of the allowance resulted from the application of the methodology  which is designed to estimate inherent losses on total noncovered portfolio loans  including nonperforming loans 
at december   the allowance on the million in noncovered nonaccrual loans was million  compared with an allowance on the million in noncovered nonaccrual loans at december  of million  representing an increase in the allowance of million 
at december   the allowance on the million noncovered performing troubled debt restructured loans was million  compared with an allowance on million in noncovered performing troubled debt restructured loans of million at december   representing an increase in the allowance of million 
excluding the impaired loans mentioned above  at december   the allowance for the remaining other noncovered loans was million  compared to million at december   creating a decrease in the allowance of million 
the decrease in the allowance related to these other noncovered loans mainly resulted from the decline in loans and portfolio loss trends 
this was partially offset by consideration of certain trends and qualitative factors 
these included management s assessment of economic risk particularly with respect to commercial and commercial real estate loans  portfolio loss trends  and asset quality trends  including levels of potential problem loans and loan concentrations in commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans  which together comprised approximately of our noncovered portfolio loans at december  based on its analysis management believes the amount of the allowance is appropriate 
covered loans were million at december  these loans are subject to protection under the loss sharing agreements with the fdic and currently have an allowance for loan losses of million based on analysis of expected future cash flows and collateral valuations 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was of noncovered nonperforming loans  compared to of noncovered nonperforming loans at december  noncovered nonaccrual loans  which comprise the majority of noncovered nonperforming loans  were million as of december   an increase of million  or  from december  noncovered nonaccrual loans at december  were comprised of relationships and were primarily concentrated in commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and real estate construction loans 
all noncovered nonaccrual loans are considered impaired and are carried at their estimated collectible amounts 
covered nonperforming loans of million at december  and million at december  are subject to protection under the loss share agreements with the fdic

the guidelines are commonly known as risk based capital guidelines 
on december   we exceeded all applicable capital requirements  having a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier risk based capital ratio of  and a tier leverage ratio of 
banking subsidiaries are also required to maintain capital ratios in accordance with guidelines adopted by their primary regulators 
the general regulatory minimums to be well capitalized are a total capital to risk weighted assets ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a tier leverage ratio of 
as of december   we  stillwater national  and bank of kansas each met the criteria for classification as a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action rules promulgated under the federal deposit insurance act 
designation as a well capitalized institution under these regulations does not constitute a recommendation or endorsement of us  stillwater national  or bank of kansas by federal bank regulators 
see certain regulatory matters below 
certain regulatory matters effective may   stillwater national is no longer subject to the written formal agreement the agreement that was entered into on january  with the occ 
the agreement primarily related to levels of commercial real estate lending and problem assets  and included a requirement for stillwater national to submit written plans to the occ and to take required actions related to improving credit risk management 
further  stillwater national is no longer subject to the informal individual minimum capital agreement also entered into on january   which required stillwater national to maintain a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a tier leverage ratio of at least

like all national banks  stillwater national remains subject to legal and regulatory limitations on the amount of dividends that it may pay without prior approval of the occ 
under these regulations  the total amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year by stillwater national to us without occ approval is limited to the current year s net profits  combined with the retained profits of the preceding two years 
losses experienced in  primarily attributable to the fourth quarter sale of approximately million in loans and other real estate  affect stillwater national s ability to pay dividends without prior occ approval 
in july  with the consent of the federal reserve we terminated the supervisory resolution that was adopted at the request of the federal reserve in july this resolution included providing prior notice to the federal reserve of planned dividends to security holders and planned receipts of dividends from our banking subsidiaries 
liquidity liquidity is measured by a financial institution s ability to raise funds through deposits  borrowed funds  capital  or the sale of highly marketable assets  such as available for sale investments  in order to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
additional sources of liquidity  including cash flow from the repayment of loans and maturities of investment securities  are also considered in determining whether liquidity is satisfactory 
other sources of liquidity can be provided by fhlb frb  and correspondent lines of credit 
liquidity is also achieved through growth of deposits and liquid assets and accessibility to the capital and money markets 
these funds are used to meet deposit withdrawals  maintain reserve requirements  fund loans  purchase securities  and operate the organization

effects of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and practices within the banking industry that require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering fluctuations in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our income is largely dependent on our net interest income 
we seek to maximize our net interest margin within an acceptable level of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the amount of forecasted net interest income that may be gained or lost due to favorable or unfavorable movements in interest rates 
interest rate risk  or sensitivity  arises when the maturity or repricing characteristics of assets differ significantly from the maturity or repricing characteristics of liabilities 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds such as noninterest bearing deposits and shareholders equity 
we attempt to manage interest rate risk while enhancing net interest margin by adjusting our asset liability position 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long term and other interest rates  market conditions  and competitive factors  we may increase our interest rate risk position in order to increase its net interest margin 
we monitor interest rate risk and adjust the composition of our rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates on net interest income over time 
our asset liability committee reviews our interest rate risk position and profitability and recommends adjustments 
our asset liability committee also reviews the securities portfolio  formulates investment strategies  and oversees the timing and implementation of transactions 
notwithstanding our interest rate risk management activities  the actual magnitude  direction  and relationship of future interest rates are uncertain and can have adverse effects on net income and liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity analysis measures the cumulative differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing within various time periods 
the following table shows our interest rate sensitivity gaps for selected maturity or repricing periods at december  to to over to over dollars in thousands months months years years total rate sensitive assets total loans investment securities other investments at costs due from banks total rate sensitive liabilities money market deposit accounts time deposits savings accounts interest bearing demand other borrowings subordinated debentures total interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap percentage of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities percentage of cumulative gap to total assets the percentage of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities presents a static position as of a single day  is not necessarily indicative of our position at any other point in time  and does not take into account the sensitivity of yields and costs of specific assets and liabilities to changes in market rates 
the foregoing analysis assumes that our mortgage backed securities mature during the period in which they are estimated to be prepaid 
no other prepayment or repricing assumptions have been applied to our interest earning assets for this analysis 
a principal objective of our asset liability management effort is to balance the various factors that generate interest rate risk  thereby maintaining our interest rate sensitivity within acceptable risk levels 
to measure our interest rate sensitivity position  we utilize a simulation model that facilitates the forecasting of net interest income over the next twelve month period under a variety of interest rate and growth scenarios 
the earnings simulation model uses numerous assumptions regarding the effect of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics  future cash flows  and customer behavior 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net income 
actual results differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions  cash flows  and management strategies  among other factors 
the balance sheet is subject to quarterly testing for six alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by   and basis points bp  although we may elect not to use particular scenarios that we determine are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at various interest rate shock levels 
measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
estimated change in net interest income changes in interest rates bp bp bp december  december  the current overnight rate as established by the federal open market committee is in the to range 
we believe that all down rate scenarios are impractical since they would result in an overnight rate of less than 
as a result  the down bp  down bp and down bp scenarios have been excluded 
net interest income at risk as of december  experienced a decline in each of the three rising interest rate scenarios when compared to the december  risk position 
our greatest exposure to changes in interest rate is in the bp scenario with a decline in net interest income of on december   a reduction from the december  level of 
the subsidiary banks are in compliance with all policy limits established for net interest income at risk 
the decline in net interest income for and was due to the decrease in interest earning assets  primarily loans  and the continued repricing of existing loans and deposits as interest rates remained at historical lows 
the measures of equity value at risk indicate our ongoing economic value by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of our cash flows  and discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities 
the difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity  which  in theory  approximates the fair value of our net assets 
estimated change in economic value of equity eve changes in interest rates bp bp bp december  december  as of december  the economic value of equity measure declined in each of the three rising interest rate scenarios when compared to the december  percentages 
southwest s largest economic value of equity exposure is the bp scenario 
the bp scenario was on december   an reduction over the december  value of 
our subsidiary banks are in compliance with all policy limits established for the economic value of equity
