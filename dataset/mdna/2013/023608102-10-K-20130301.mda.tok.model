the volatility of earnings and cash flows of the merchant generation business  as well as the high degree of uncertainty regarding future returns on incremental capital invested in this business  are not in alignment with ameren current strategy 
ameren decision to exit the business follows a trend of decreasing earnings and cash flows from the merchant generation business since ameren date and method of exit from the merchant generation business is currently uncertain with a sale or restructuring possible 
senior management and ameren board of directors are focused on maximizing the overall benefit to ameren consistent with its legal obligations 
while working to exit the merchant generation business  ameren remains focused on its rate regulated utilities  including growing investments in jurisdictions with constructive regulatory frameworks 
ameren continues to seek modern  constructive regulatory frameworks  which provide timely cash flows and a reasonable opportunity to earn fair returns on investments that are in the best long term interest of ameren customers 
these frameworks support ameren rate regulated businesses ability to obtain cash on a timelier basis  to reinvest in energy infrastructure and also attract capital on terms that facilitate timely investments to modernize their aging infrastructure

in  ameren illinois elected to participate in the ieima performance based formula ratemaking framework 
the ieima was designed to promote investment in electric grid modernization and create jobs through the establishment of formula ratemaking for electric delivery service 
ameren illinois believes the icc has incorrectly implemented the ieima in both of its electric delivery service rate orders 
as a result  ameren illinois has appealed both electric delivery service rate orders to the appellate court of the fourth district of illinois and is also seeking a legislative solution to address the icc implementation of the ieima

this request was based on a future test year 
ameren continues to proceed with its plans to increase its investment in ferc regulated electric transmission 
in  for both ameren illinois and atxi  transmission rates will be updated annually based on a forward looking calculation with a revenue requirement reconciliation

the ameren illinois portion of that total  approximately billion  is for projects focused on local load growth and reliability needs 
atxi  through its construction of three miso approved regional multi value electric transmission projects  expects to invest approximately billion over the next five years 
in november  atxi filed a request with the icc for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the illinois rivers project

ameren earnings also decreased in  compared with  because of a decline in ameren illinois earnings primarily due to the impacts of implementing the ieima formula ratemaking in  including a lower allowed return on equity and required nonrecoverable contributions  as well as lower natural gas sales volumes as a result of warmer winter temperatures 
summer weather was much warmer than normal in  but similar to the earnings declines in the merchant generation and ameren illinois segments were partially offset by increased ameren missouri earnings due primarily to the full year effect of the electric rate increase as well as lower operations and maintenance expense reflecting the absence of a refueling outage at the callaway energy center in  decreased labor costs primarily due to staff reductions resulting from the voluntary separation plan  and reduced major storm related costs 
ameren missouri earnings  compared to earnings  also benefited from a favorable ferc order related to a disputed power purchase agreement that expired in and the absence of a charge to earnings related to the fac 
these positive ameren missouri factors were partially offset by higher

much of this spending is at ameren rate regulated utilities  including a total of approximately billion at atxi to invest in its electric transmission assets as discussed above
