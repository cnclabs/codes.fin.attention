overview our radio broadcasting segment derives revenue primarily from the sale of broadcast time and radio advertising on a national and local basis 
our principal sources of broadcast revenue include the sale of block program time  both to national and local program producers  the sale of advertising time on our radio stations  both to national and local advertisers  and the sale of advertising time on our national radio network 
our rates for broadcast time and advertising time vary based upon several factors  including audience share  how well our stations perform for our clients  the size of the market  the general economic conditions in each market  and supply and demand on both a local and national level 
our principal sources of internet revenue include the sale of internet advertising  the support and promotion to stream third party content on our websites  sales of software and support services  and product sales and royalties for on air host materials 
our principal sources of publishing revenue include subscription fees for our magazines  the sale of print magazine advertising  fees from authors for book publishing  and the sale of books 
broadcast segment broadcast revenues are impacted by the program rates our radio stations charge  the level of broadcast airtime sold and by the advertising rates our radio stations and networks charge 
the rates for block programming time are based upon our stations ability to attract audiences that will support the program producers through contributions and purchases of their products 
advertising rates are based upon the demand for advertising time  which in turn is based on our stations and networks ability to produce results for their advertisers 
we do not subscribe to traditional audience measuring services for most of our radio stations 
instead  we have 
table of contents marketed ourselves to advertisers based upon the responsiveness of our audiences 
in selected markets  we do subscribe to arbitron  which develops quarterly reports to measure a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers 
each of our radio stations and our networks has a pre determined level of time that they make available for block programming and or advertising  which may vary at different times of the day 
arbitron has developed technology to collect data for its ratings service 
the ppm is a small device that does not require active manipulation by the end user and is capable of automatically measuring radio  television  internet  satellite radio and satellite television signals that are encoded for the service by the broadcaster 
the ppm offers a number of advantages over the traditional diary ratings collection system including ease of use  more reliable ratings data and shorter time periods between when advertising runs and when audience listening or viewing habits can be reported 
this service is already in a number of our markets and is scheduled to be introduced in more markets in the future 
in markets where we subscribe to arbitron under the ppm  our ratings have been less consistent 
ppm data can fluctuate when changes are made to the panel a group of individuals holding ppm devices 
this makes all stations susceptible to some inconsistencies in ratings that may or may not accurately reflect the actual number of listeners at any given time 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our second and fourth quarter advertising revenue generally exceeds our first and third quarter advertising revenue 
this seasonal fluctuation in advertising revenue corresponds with quarterly fluctuations in the retail advertising industry 
quarterly revenue from the sale of block programming time does not tend to vary significantly  however  because program rates are generally set annually and are recognized on a per program basis 
we currently program of our stations with our christian teaching and talk format  which is talk programming with christian and family themes 
we also program news talk stations  contemporary christian music stations  business format stations  and seven spanish language christian teaching and talk stations 
the business format features financial experts  business talk  and nationally recognized bloomberg programming 
the business format operates similar to our christian teaching and talk format as it features long form block programming 
our cash flow is historically affected by a transitional period experienced by radio stations when  due to the nature of the radio station  our plans for the market and other circumstances  we find it beneficial to change its format 
this transitional period is when we develop a radio station s listener and customer base 
during this period  a station may generate negative or insignificant cash flow 
in the broadcasting industry  radio stations often utilize trade or barter agreements to exchange advertising time for goods or services in lieu of cash 
in order to preserve the sale of our advertising time for cash  we generally enter into trade agreements only if the goods or services bartered to us will be used in our business 
we have minimized our use of trade agreements and have generally sold most of our advertising time for cash 
in  we sold of our broadcast revenue for cash 
in addition  it is our general policy not to preempt advertising paid for in cash with advertising paid for in trade 
the primary operating expenses incurred in the ownership and operation of our radio stations include i employee salaries  commissions and related employee benefits and taxes  ii facility expenses such as rent and utilities  iii marketing and promotional expenses and iv music license fees 
in addition to these expenses  our network incurs programming costs and lease expenses for satellite communication facilities 
we also incur and expect to continue to incur significant depreciation  amortization and interest expense as a result of completed and future acquisitions and existing and future borrowings 
internet segment salem web network and our internet business earns revenues from the sales of streaming services  sales of advertising and  to a lesser extent  sales of software  software support contracts and consumer products such as dvd s and editorial products 
the revenues of these businesses are reported as internet revenue on our consolidated statements of operations

non gaap financial measures the performance of a radio broadcasting company is customarily measured by the ability of its stations to generate station operating income 
we define station operating income soi as net broadcast revenue less broadcast operating expenses 
accordingly  changes in net broadcast revenue and broadcast operating expenses  as explained above  have a direct impact on changes in soi 
soi is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
soi should be viewed as a supplement to and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on the basis of gaap 
management believes that soi is a useful non gaap financial measure to investors  when considered in conjunction with operating income most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it is generally recognized by the radio broadcasting industry as a tool in measuring performance and in applying valuation methodologies for companies in the media  entertainment and communications industries 
this measure is used by investors and analysts who report on the industry to provide comparisons between broadcasting groups 
additionally  our management uses soi as one of the key measures of operating efficiency  profitability and our internal review associated with our impairment analysis of indefinite lived intangible assets 
soi does not purport to represent cash provided by operating activities 
our statement of cash flows presents our cash flow activity and our income statement presents our historical performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
soi as defined by and used by our company is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  see note  significant accounting policies  of the accompanying the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
note contains several other policies which are important to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  but do not meet the sec s definition of critical accounting policies because they do not involve subjective or complex judgments 
accounting for acquisitions and upgrades of radio station and network assets a majority of our radio station acquisitions have consisted primarily of the fcc licenses to broadcast in a particular market 
we often do not acquire the existing format  or we change the format upon acquisition when we find it beneficial 
as a result  a substantial portion of the purchase price for the assets of a radio station is allocated to the broadcast license 
it is our policy generally to retain third party appraisers to value radio stations  networks  internet businesses or publishing properties 
the allocations assigned to acquired broadcast licenses and other assets are subjective by their nature and require our careful consideration and judgment 
we believe the allocations represent appropriate estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired 
as part of the valuation and appraisal process  the third party appraisers prepare reports that assign values to the various asset categories in our financial statements 
our management reviews these reports and determines the reasonableness of the assigned values used to record the acquisition of these properties at the close of the transaction 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc broadcast licenses 
our policy is to capitalize costs incurred up to the point where the project is complete  at which time we transfer the costs to the appropriate fixed asset and or intangible asset categories 
when the completion of a project is contingent upon fcc or other regulatory approval  we assess the probable future benefit of the asset at the time that it is recorded and monitor it through the fcc or other regulatory approval process 
in the event the required approval is not considered probable or the project is abandoned  we write off the capitalized costs of the project 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the service has been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection of the arrangement fee is reasonably assured 
revenues from radio programs and commercial advertising are recognized when the program or advertisement is broadcast 
revenue is reported net of agency commissions  which are calculated based on a stated percentage applied to gross billing 
our customers principally include not for profit charitable organizations and commercial advertisers 
revenue from the sale of products and services are recognized when the products are shipped and the services are rendered 
revenues from the sale of advertising in our magazines are recognized upon publication 
revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our publications is recognized over the life of the subscription 
revenue from book sales is recorded when shipment occurs 
multiple deliverables we may enter bundled advertising agreements that include spot advertisements on our radio stations  internet banner placements  print magazine advertisements and booth space at specific events  or some combination thereof 
the multiple deliverables contained in each agreement are accounted for separately over their respective delivery period provided that they are separate units of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available or estimated selling price if vendor specific objective evidence is not available 
objective evidence of fair value includes the price 
table of contents charged for each element when it is sold separately 
the estimated selling price is the price that we would transact if the deliverable was sold regularly on a standalone basis 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of each arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
the relative selling price method allocates any discount in the arrangement proportionally to each deliverable on the basis of each deliverable s selling price 
barter transactions we may provide advertising time in exchange for certain products  supplies and services 
the terms of the exchanges generally permit for the preemption of such broadcast time in favor of advertisers who purchase time on regular terms 
we include the value of such exchanges in both net broadcasting revenues and broadcast operating expenses 
the value recorded for barter revenues is based upon management s estimate of the fair value of the products  supplies and services received 
advertising time that our radio stations exchange for goods and or services is recorded as barter revenue when the advertisement is broadcast at an amount equal to our estimate fair value of what was received 
the value of the goods or services received in such barter transactions is charged to expense as used 
barter advertising revenue included in broadcast revenue for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively  and barter expenses were approximately the same as barter revenue for each period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
an analysis is performed by applying various percentages based on the age of the receivable and other subjective and historical analysis 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of ultimate realization of these receivables including the current creditworthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
accounting for discontinued operations we regularly review underperforming assets to determine if a sale might be a better way to monetize the assets 
when a station  group of stations  or other asset groups are considered for sale  we review the transaction to determine if or when the entity qualifies as a discontinued operation in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc topic discontinued operations 
this pronouncement specifies that the operations and cash flow of the entity disposed of  or to be sold  have or will be eliminated from the ongoing operations as a result of the disposal and that we will not have significant continuing involvement in the operations after the disposal transaction 
for our radio stations  we define a cluster as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building  equipment  and managed by a single general manager 
the cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results 
general managers are compensated based on the results of their cluster as a whole  not the results of any individual radio stations 
we have determined that a radio market qualifies for a discontinued operation when management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the asset disposal group  the sale is probable  and the sale will result in the exit of a particular geographic market 
during the th quarter of  based on operating results that did not meet expectations  we ceased operating samaritan fundraising as of december  samaritan fundraising  reported in our internet operations  was a web based fundraising products company operating from a single facility in fairfax  va  under the control of one general manager 
as a result of our decision to close operations  there were no material cash flows associated with this entity and we have no ongoing or further involvement in the operations of this entity 
we have reported the operating results and net assets of this entity as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets approximately of our total assets as of december   consist of indefinite lived intangible assets  such as broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads  the value of which depends significantly upon the operating results of our businesses 
in the case of our radio stations  we would not be able to operate the properties without the related fcc license for each property 
broadcast licenses are renewed with the fcc every eight years for a nominal cost that is expensed as incurred 
we continually monitor our stations compliance with the various regulatory requirements 
historically  all of our broadcast licenses are renewed at the end of their respective periods  and we expect that all broadcast licenses will continue to be renewed in the future 
accordingly  we consider our broadcast licenses to be indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
broadcast licenses account for approximately of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill and magazine mastheads account for the remaining 
we do not amortize goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets  but rather test for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired 
we complete our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
we believe that our estimate of the value of our broadcast licenses  mastheads  and goodwill is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimates incorporate variables and assumptions that are based on experiences and judgment about future operating performance of our markets and business segments 
the fair value measurements for our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
the unobservable inputs are defined in fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures as level inputs discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
broadcast licenses the unit of accounting we use to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager 
the cluster level is the lowest level for which discrete financial information and cash flows are available and the level reviewed by management to analyze operating results 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic 
under asu  we have the option to assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if it is more likely than not that impairment exists  we are required to perform a quantitative analysis to estimate the fair value of the assets 
the qualitative assessment requires significant judgment in considering events and circumstances that may affect the estimated fair value of our broadcast licenses and to weigh the events and circumstances by what we believe to be the strongest to weakest indicator of potential impairment 
asu is effective for annual and interim impairment tests for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the provisions of asu as of our annual testing period 
during and prior years  we applied the start up income approach to estimate the fair value of each of our broadcast licenses 
we reviewed the significant assumptions in our most recent fair value estimates that were completed during our annual testing period ending december  our review included an assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect the significant inputs used in these fair value estimates 
our fair value calculations were prepared using the start up income approach to estimate the fair value of the broadcast license 
the start up income approach measures the expected future economic benefits that the broadcast licenses provide and discounts these future benefits using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis assumes that the broadcast licenses hypothetical start up stations and the values yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis represent the portion of the stations value attributable solely to the broadcast license 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates variables such as projected revenues  operating profit margins  forecasted growth rates  estimated start up costs  losses expected to be incurred in the early years  competition within the market  the effective tax rate  future terminal values and the risk adjusted discount rate 
the variables used reflect historical company growth trends  industry projections  and the anticipated performance of the business 
the discounted cash flow projection period was determined to be ten years  which is typically the time radio station operators and investors expect to recover their investments as widely used by industry analysts in their forecasts 
the key estimates and assumptions used in the start up income valuation for all of our broadcast licenses were as follows broadcast licenses december  discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term market revenue growth rate ranges 
table of contents we reviewed each of the key estimates and assumptions and determined that there have been no significant changes that would need to be applied to a hypothetical start up station in order to estimate the fair value 
projected revenues  operating profit margins  forecasted growth rates  estimated start up costs  losses expected to be incurred in the early years  competition within the market  the effective tax rate  future terminal values and the risk adjusted discount rate are consistent with those applied in the testing period 
we also reviewed internal benchmarks and economic performance for each of our markets to conclude that we could reasonably rely upon the fair value estimates and assumptions as a starting point to our qualitative analysis 
we calculated the amount by which the estimated fair values exceeded our carrying amounts to calculate the excess of fair value 
we concluded that markets with broadcast licenses with a or more excess of the estimated fair value over the carrying value were not likely to be impaired 
we believe based on our analysis and review  including the financial performance of each market  that a excess fair value margin is conservative and reasonable in the qualitative analysis 
the tables below present the percentage within a range by which the estimated fair value exceeded the carrying value of our broadcasting licenses for each of our clusters geographic clusters as of december  percentage range by which fair value exceeds carrying value to than number of market clusters broadcast license carrying value in thousands we considered the markets with an excess fair value that was less than of the carrying values to be more likely than not impaired 
for these markets  we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm to perform a quantitative appraisal of our broadcast licenses 
bond pecaro utilized the start up income approach to value broadcast licenses 
the key estimates and assumptions used in the bond pecaro start up income valuation for these selected markets were as follows broadcast licenses december  discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term market revenue growth rate ranges the table below presents the results of our quantitative analysis for the annual testing period ending december  market cluster excess fair value estimate excess fair value estimate atlanta  ga chicago  il cleveland  oh dallas  tx detroit  mi louisville  ky miami  fl omaha  ne orlando  fl portland  or sacramento  ca tampa  fl based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary to the carrying value of our broadcast licenses as of the annual testing periods ending december  based on prior tests  we determined that no impairments of our broadcast licenses were necessary for years ending december  or  respectively 
mastheads mastheads consist of the graphic elements that identify our publications to readers and advertisers 
these include customized typeset page headers  section headers  and column graphics as well as other name and identity stylized elements within the body of each publication 
we test the value of mastheads as a single combined publishing entity as our print magazines operate from one shared facility under one general manager with operating results and cash flows reported on a combined basis for all publications 

table of contents based on actual operating results as of our year end testing period that did not meet or exceed our expectations  we performed a quantitative review of mastheads as of our annual testing period ending december  we had also performed an interim valuation of mastheads as of june  in which our excess fair value was estimated to be only 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal firm  to perform an income based approach to determine the estimated fair value of our mastheads 
the income approach is based upon an estimated royalty stream that measures a cost savings to the business because it does not have to pay a royalty to use the owned trade name and content 
the analysis assumes that the assets are employed by a typical market participant in their highest and best use 
under the income approach  we utilize a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of our mastheads  the key estimates and assumptions to which are as follows mastheads december  december  interim june  december  discount rate projected revenue growth ranges royalty growth rate we recognized an impairment charge of million associated with the value of mastheads in our publishing segment as of the annual testing period ending december  the impairment was driven by a reduction in projected net revenues resulting from ongoing operating results that have not met expectations 
the impairment was indicative of trends in the publishing industry as a whole and is not unique to our company or operations 
goodwill broadcast during  we adopted asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
as a result  beginning in  the first step of the impairment tests for goodwill is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts 
if the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts  a quantitative assessment is not required 
the unit of accounting used to test broadcast licenses is the cluster level  which we define as a group of radio stations operating in the same geographic market  sharing the same building and equipment and managed by a single general manager 
nine of our market clusters and our networks have goodwill associated with them as of our annual testing period ending december  the first step of our review included an assessment to determine if events and circumstances have occurred that could affect the significant inputs used in our fair value estimates 
we estimated fair values using a market and income approach and compared the estimated fair value of each cluster to its carrying value including goodwill 
using a market approach  we applied a multiple of four to each clusters station operating income soi to calculate the estimated fair value 
radio stations are often sold on the basis of a multiple of projected cash flow  or soi 
numerous trade organizations and analysts track these radio transactions 
based on reports and analysis of these transactions  we believe industry benchmarks to be in the six to seven times cash flow range 
based our analysis  we determined that an soi benchmark of four would be a conservative indicator of fair value 
under the income approach  we utilized a discounted cash flow method to calculate the estimated fair value of the accounting unit 
the discounted cash flow method incorporates the cumulative present value of the net after tax cash flows projected for each market assuming that it is a hypothetical start up station 
the key estimates and assumptions used in the start up income valuation of our broadcast markets for each testing period are as follows december  goodwill broadcast market clusters discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term market revenue growth rate ranges if the carrying amount  including goodwill  exceeds the estimated fair value of the cluster  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that cluster may be impaired 
when we have indication of impairment  we perform a second step to determine the amount of any impairment 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  to determine the enterprise value of three of our markets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start up 
the key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows 
table of contents december  broadcast market clusters enterprise valuations discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term revenue market growth rate ranges based on our review and analysis we determined that no broadcast goodwill impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending december   and the estimated fair value of our networks exceeded the carrying value by   and for each of the annual testing periods ending december   and  respectively 
the tables below present the percentage within a range by which the enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of each of our clusters  including goodwill broadcast market clusters as of december  percentage range by which enterprise value exceeds carrying value inclu ding goodwill to to than number of market clusters enterprise carrying value in thousands broadcast market clusters as of december  percentage range by which enterprise value exceeds carrying value including goodwi ll to to than number of market clusters enterprise carrying value in thousands broadcast market clusters as of december  percentage range by which enterprise value exceeds carrying value including goodwill to to than number of market clusters enterprise carrying value in thousands goodwill internet publishing during  we adopted asu  testing goodwill for impairment 
as a result  beginning in  the first step of the impairment tests for goodwill is a thorough assessment of qualitative factors to determine if events or circumstances indicate that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts 
if the qualitative test indicates it is not more likely than not that the fair value of these assets is less than their carrying amounts  a quantitative assessment is not required 
the units of accounting we use to test goodwill in our internet business include townhall 
com and salem web network 
the operating results for salem web network reflect the operating results and cash flows for all of our internet sites exclusive of townhall 
com 
we also separate our publishing business into two accounting units 
the first publishing accounting unit is the magazine unit  which operates and produces all publications from a stand alone facility  under one general manager  with operating results and cash flows of all publications reported on a combined basis 
the second accounting unit is our book publishing division  xulon press  which also operates from a stand alone facility  under one general manager who is responsible for the separately stated operating results and cash flows 
four of these accounting units have goodwill associated with them as our annual testing period 
we applied a market approach to estimate the fair value of each or our accounting units 
under the market approach  we applied a multiple of four to each accounting units operating income to estimate the fair value 
we believe that a multiple of four is a conservative benchmark based on actual industry transactions 
the first step of our review compared the estimated fair value of each accounting unit to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the carrying amount  including goodwill  exceeded the estimated fair value of the unit  an indication exists that the amount of goodwill attributed to that unit may be impaired 
when we have indication of impairment  we performed a second step to determine the amount of any impairment 
we engaged bond pecaro  an independent third party appraisal and valuation firm  to determine the enterprise value of one of our accounting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the enterprise valuation assumes that the subject assets are installed as part of an operating business rather than as a hypothetical start up 
the key estimates and assumptions used for our enterprise valuations are as follows 
table of contents december  enterprise valuations discount rate operating profit margin ranges long term revenue growth rate ranges the key assumptions in our third party enterprise valuation varied from the testing period ending december  to the testing period ending december  due to the accounting units for which the enterprise valuations were performed 
due to the nature of the business  publishing varies greatly from our print magazines to our online print on demand digital book publisher and our internet businesses 
the key estimates for include the ranges applicable to both publishing and our internet businesses 
based on our review and analysis we determined that no impairment charges were necessary as of the annual testing periods ending december   and the table below presents the percentage within a range by which the enterprise value exceeded the carrying value of our accounting units  including goodwill 
internet and publishing accounting units as of december  percentage range by which enterprise value exceeds carrying value inclu ding goodwill to to than number of accounting units enterprise carrying value in thousands we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  however  these estimates and assumptions could be materially different from actual results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the industry or by us  or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets below the amounts reflected on our balance sheet  we may recognize future impairment charges  the amount of which may be material 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
upon the adoption of the provisions on january   we had million in liabilities related to uncertain tax positions  including million recognized under fasb asc topic contingencies and carried forward from prior years and million recognized upon adoption of the tax provision changes as a reduction to retained earnings 
included in the million accrual was million in related interest  net of federal income tax benefits 
during  we recognized a net increase of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
during  we recognized a net decrease of million in liabilities and at december   had million in liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits 
included in this liability amount were million accrued for the related interest  net of federal income tax benefits and million for the related penalties recorded in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
management expects an additional reduction of million in the reserve over the next twelve months due to statute expirations 
a summary of the changes in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows december  dollars in thousands balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions based on tax positions related to prior years reductions related to tax positions of prior years decrease due to statute expirations related interest and penalties  net of federal tax benefits balance as of december  valuation allowance deferred taxes for financial reporting purposes  we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december  to offset a portion of the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
management regularly reviews our financial forecasts in an effort to determine our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes 
accordingly  the valuation allowance is adjusted periodically based on management s estimate of the benefit the company will receive from such carryforwards 

table of contents fair value accounting fasb asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures established a single definition of fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expanded disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
the provision applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
we adopted the fair value provisions for financial assets and financial liabilities effective january  the adoption had a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we adopted fair value provisions for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january  this includes applying the fair value concept to i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations  ii reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill impairment testing  iii other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments  and iv asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value 
the adoption of the fair value provisions of fasb asc topic to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value provisions include guidance on how to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities in the current economic environment and reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
if we were to conclude that there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity of the asset or liability in relation to normal market activities  quoted market values may not be representative of fair value and we may conclude that a change in valuation technique or the use of multiple valuation techniques may be appropriate 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
pricing observability is affected by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market  and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments rarely traded or not quoted will generally have less or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
fasb asc topic established a hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring fair value 
this framework defined three levels of inputs to the fair value measurement process and requires that each fair value measurement be assigned to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
the three broad levels of inputs defined by the fasb asc topic hierarchy are as follows level inputs quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date  level inputs inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
if the asset or liability has a specified contractual term  a level input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  and level inputs unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
these unobservable inputs reflect the entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances which might include the reporting entity s own data 
as of december   the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  trade accounts receivables  accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued interest approximates fair value due to the short term nature of such instruments 
the carrying value of other long term liabilities approximates fair value as the related interest rates approximate rates currently available to the company 
long term debt and debt covenant compliance our classification of borrowings under our revolver as long term debt on our balance sheet is based on our assessment that  under the terms of our credit agreement and after considering our projected operating results and cash flows for the coming year  no principal payments are required to be made 
these projections are estimates dependent upon a number of factors including but not limited to developments in the markets in which we are operating in and varying economic and political factors 
accordingly  these projections are inherently uncertain and our actual results could differ from these estimates

impairment losses on goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  indefinite lived intangibles  including broadcast licenses  goodwill and mastheads are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment 
impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset over its fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses 
we incurred significant impairment losses in prior years with regard to our indefinite lived intangible assets 
during the current year  we recognized impairment losses of million associated with mastheads in our publishing segment 
this impairment was driven by a reduction in projected net revenues resulting from ongoing operating results that have not met expectations 
the impairment was indicative of trends in the publishing industry as a whole and is not unique to our company or operations 
the valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations 
the fair value measurements of our indefinite lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk 
if actual future results are less favorable than the assumptions and estimates we used  we are subject to future impairment charges  the amount of which may be material 
given the current economic environment and uncertainties that can negatively impact our business  there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of our indefinite lived intangible fair value estimates will prove to be accurate 
the impairment charges we have recognized are non cash in nature and did violate covenants on our then existing credit facilities or revolver 
however  the potential for future impairment charges can be viewed as a negative factor with regard to forecasted future performance and cash flows 
we believe that we have adequately considered the economic downturn in our valuation models and do not believe that the non cash impairments in and of themselves are a liquidity risk 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  salem did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  salem is not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if salem had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations we enter into various agreements in the normal course of business that contain minimum guarantees 
the typical minimum guarantee is tied to future revenue amounts that exceed the contractual level 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of these arrangements is zero 
we undertake projects from time to time to upgrade our radio station technical facilities and or fcc broadcast licenses  expand our internet offerings  improve our facilities and update our computer infrastructures 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million throughout the twelve months ending december   the nature and timing of these upgrades and expenditures can be delayed or scaled back at the discretion of management 
on february   we launched a tender offer to purchase for cash any and all of the outstanding notes and a related consent solicitation collectively  the tender offer to amend the indenture governing the notes the indenture 
in connection with the tender offer  we plan to enter into a new senior secured term loan of up to million  which will be used to fund the purchase of any notes that are tendered in the tender offer 
we also plan to enter into a new senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million 
if the requisite consents have been obtained from holders of the notes in the tender offer  substantially all of the restrictive covenants  certain events of default and other provisions contained in the indenture will be eliminated and the liens on the assets that secure the notes will be released  making any notes that remain outstanding after the consummation of the tender offer effectively subordinated to the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility to the extent of the value of the collateral 
the proceeds from these facilities will be used to fund the tender offer and retire all other outstanding corporate debt 
holders of the notes who tender by the consent payment deadline  which is pm  new york city time  on march   will receive a consent payment as part of the tender offer consideration 
the tender offer is anticipated to expire at midnight  new york city time  on march  regardless of whether we obtain the requisite consents from holders of the notes in the tender offer  we intend  at our sole discretion and without any obligation to do so  to 
table of contents retire any notes that are not tendered in the tender offer in accordance with the terms of the indenture  which may include redeeming the notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus the applicable premium as defined in the indenture as of  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but not including  the redemption date the make whole redemption and or pursuant to a provision in the indenture whereby  prior to december   we may redeem up to an aggregate million of the notes in any month period  in connection with up to two redemptions in such month period  at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date the redemption 
the first million of untendered notes are expected to be redeemed pursuant to the redemption on june   the next million of untendered notes are expected to be redeem pursuant to the redemption on december   and the balance of untendered notes are expected to be redeemed pursuant to the make whole redemption on the applicable redemption date following the requisite notice 
upon entry into the new term loan and the new revolving credit facility  the revolver  fcb loan  and subordinated debt due to related parties will be terminated 
the following table summarizes our aggregate contractual obligations at december   and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period contractual less than more than obligations total one year years years years dollars in thousands long term debt  including current portion interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations and other loans operating leases on air talent other contracts total contractual cash obligations interest payments on long term debt are based on the outstanding debt and respective interest rates with interest rates on variable rate debt held constant through maturity at the december  rates 
interest ultimately paid on these obligations will differ based on changes in interest rates for variable rate debt  as well as any potential repayments or future refinancing 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details 
on air talent agreements are typically one to three years in length with various renewal dates 
the liability shown is based on agreements in effect as of december  future payments will vary as the agreements are renewed
