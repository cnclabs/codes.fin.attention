table of contents strategic and financial overview since  we have been implementing a strategy centered on continually strengthening three aspects of our business that can most affect profitable growth our top line  our bottom line and our pipeline 
this strategy includes three facets  growth in our core business  growth through acquisitions and growth through the development and commercialization of complete medical devices 
as a result of this strategy  sales increased for and for sales growth for and included the benefit from our acquisitions of million and million  respectively 
additionally  sales include the impact from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  which decreased sales by million in comparison to and increased sales by million in comparison to on a constant currency  organic basis sales were consistent from to and increased from to as growth from our vascular and portable medical product lines more than offset the impact the declining cardiac rhythm management crm market had on our cardiac and neuromodulation product line 
our portable medical product line is benefiting from new product introductions and market shift in patient care from clinical settings to the home  and an aging population  which is driving the need for lightweight and portable devices for patients and caregivers 
our vascular product line growth is being driven by growth in the underlying market  market share gains and the commercialization of our medical devices 
despite the declining crm market  we were able to grow our cardiac business faster than the underlying market through innovation as well as deepening customer relationships 
for  we expect revenue  after adjusting for the sale of a portion of our orthopaedic product line  to organically grow driven primarily by our portable medical  vascular and orthopaedic product lines along with above market growth in cardiac and neuromodulation 
simultaneous with the initiation of our growth strategy  we began evolving our product offerings to include the development of complete medical devices in order to raise the growth and profitability profile of the company 
this medical device strategy is being facilitated through our qig group and leverages the component technology of greatbatch medical 
more specifically  this strategy includes the development of a neuromodulation platform that can be used to support several devices most notably of which is our spinal cord stimulator for the treatment of chronic pain in the trunk and limbs  which we call algostim 
we currently expect to submit this device to regulatory authorities in the second half of incremental investments in all of our medical device products  including algostim  totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively  and included charges to selling  general and administrative expenses sg a and research  development and engineering  net rd e 
as a result of this strategy  as well as our acquisitions  sg a increased during both and while rd e increased and  respectively  for the same periods 
during the second half of  we began a process to more fully optimize our research and development efforts 
this included the reallocation of research and development resources to higher priority projects  the postponement of some research and development projects  and the decision to pursue various alternatives to monetize our existing non core intellectual property and entering into more co development arrangements with our customers 
as a result  rd e for the second half of was million lower than the first half of these reductions are also expected to benefit 
table of contents we have a longstanding history of operational excellence  which is one of our core competencies 
as we move forward  investing in our operations will continue to be critical to the success of our growth and medical device strategies 
since  we have invested substantial resources in integrating our acquisitions and streamlining our operations 
this strategy continued during as we worked diligently to resolve the operational issues we were experiencing at our swiss orthopaedic facilities  expanded our manufacturing infrastructure to support the commercialization of our medical devices and upgraded our global erp system in order to support our future growth 
as a result of these initiatives  our other operating expense totaled million over the last three years  million of which was incurred during these expenses are expected to be reduced significantly in and to range from million to million  which will improve the overall earnings of greatbatch 
while we continually identify and implement cost improvement initiatives  we have now completed all of our major plant consolidations  which began in  so our leadership team can focus on achieving sustainable organic growth to leverage our available capacity 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
additionally  we consistently report and discuss in our quarterly earnings releases and investor presentations adjusted operating income and margin  adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per diluted share  which are non gaap measures 
these adjusted amounts consist of gaap amounts and  to the extent occurring during a period  excludes i acquisition related charges  ii facility consolidation  optimization  manufacturing transfer and system integration charges  iii asset write down and disposition charges  iv severance charges in connection with corporate realignments or a reduction in force v litigation charges and gains  vi the impact of non cash charges to interest expense due to the accounting change governing convertible debt  vii unusual or infrequently occurring items  viii certain rd e expenditures  such as design verification testing dvt expenses incurred in connection with the development of our neuromodulation platform  ix gain loss on the sale of investments  x the income tax benefit related to these adjustments and xi certain tax charges related to the consolidation of our swiss orthopaedic facility 
we believe that reporting these amounts provides important supplemental information to our investors and creditors seeking to understand the financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  the performance based compensation of our executive management is determined utilizing these adjusted amounts

table of contents for  we expect our performance to improve as we progress through the year  as the first quarter of will be impacted by the startup of our recently transferred orthopaedic production lines 
the second half of the year is expected to improve as the orthopaedic backlog is relieved and new product introductions in our portable medical business commercialize

included in the above range are residual dvt costs in the range of to million to complete our algostim project 
cost savings and consolidation efforts in  and  we recorded charges in other operating expenses  net related to cost savings and consolidation efforts 
these initiatives were undertaken to improve our operational efficiencies and profitability 
additional information regarding the timing  cash flow impact and amount of future expenditures is set forth in note other operating expenses  net of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  as well as the liquidity and capital resources section of this item 

table of contents over the last two years  we have been implementing a multi faceted plan to further enhance  optimize and leverage our orthopaedics operations 
this plan includes the construction of an orthopaedic manufacturing facility in fort wayne  in  updating our indianapolis  in facility to streamline operations  increase capacity  and further expand capabilities  and the transfer of most major functions currently performed at our facilities in orvin and corgemont  switzerland into our fort wayne  in and tijuana  mexico facilities 
the total capital investment expected for these initiatives is between million and million  of which million has been expended to date 
total expense expected to be incurred for these initiatives is between million and million  of which million has been incurred to date 
near the end of  we initiated plans to optimize and expand our manufacturing infrastructure in order to support our medical device strategy 
this included the transfer of certain product lines to lower cost facilities  expansion of two of our existing facilities  as well as the purchase of equipment to create additional capacity for the manufacture of medical devices and create additional cost savings 
total capital investment under these initiatives is expected to be between million to million of which approximately million has been expended to date 
total expenses expected to be incurred on these projects is between million to million of which million has been incurred to date 
these orthopaedic and medical device initiatives are expected to be completed over the next year and are expected to generate approximately million to million of annual cost savings and increase our capacity in order to support our growth and the manufacturing of complete medical devices 
in  we initiated plans to upgrade our existing global erp system 
this initiative is expected to be completed over the next year 
total capital investment under this initiative is expected to be approximately million to million of which approximately million has been expended to date 
total expenses expected to be incurred on this initiative is between million to million of which million has been incurred to date 
product development implantable medical as a result of the investments we have made  we are able to provide our implantable medical customers with complete medical devices 
this medical device strategy is being facilitated through the qig group and includes strategic equity investments and medical devices developed independently as well as in conjunction with our oem partners 
today we have four medical devices that we are independently working on that are in various stages of development 
while we do not intend to discuss each of these projects individually each quarter  we will discuss significant milestones as they occur 
some of the medical device projects that we currently are working on include cardiovascular portfolio venous and arterial introducers  anti microbial coatings  steerable delivery systems  and mri conditional brady  gastric stimulation and sleep apnea leads 
during  we received us food and drug administration fda k clearance on our transradial catheter sheath introducer and steerable delivery sheath for atrial fibrillation ablation and received the ce mark for distribution of our transseptal needle that supports access and delivery of ablation therapies for atrial fibrillation 
during  greatbatch medical observed manufacturing irregularities during inspection of its bi directional guiding sheath 
this problem was identified after implementing a new inspection tool for use in performing inspections 
as a result  greatbatch medical decided to perform a field action on this product in late revenue on this product  which totaled million in  is expected to be temporarily delayed until the second half of 
table of contents neuromodulation portfolio with regards to algostim  our spinal cord stimulator for the treatment of chronic pain in the trunk and limbs  we continue to make strong technical progress on the development of this device and continue to retire critical milestones needed for program completion and the ultimate submission to regulatory authorities  which we expect in the second half of additionally  we continue to receive strong interest from numerous world class medical device companies  who appreciate the unique opportunity to market and distribute algostim to interventional pain physicians  neurosurgeons and orthopaedic spine surgeons around the world 
we believe algostim s unique features and benefits will allow the right commercial partner to capture significant market share in today s billion spinal cord stimulation market  which continues to see double digit market growth 
we look forward to sharing more details regarding algostim and our commercial partner progress at our next investor day in march approximately million of the neuronexus purchase price in february was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired in process research and development ipr d 
these projects are expected to generate cash flows but have not yet reached technological feasibility  and thus were classified as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated projects 
the value assigned to ipr d related to the development of micro electrodes for deep brain mapping and electrocorticography 
there have been no significant changes from our original estimates with regards to these projects 
electrochem electrochem continues to win new customers  new applications and next generation products 
our core competencies enable us to be well positioned to win existing share and additional new product introductions based on our experience in packaging solutions  our customer relationships  our investment in technology and facilities  our capacity to service our customers  and our legacy of delivering highly reliable and innovative solutions to the medical marketplace 
the growth in electrochem is being driven by successful product launches into the higher growth  higher value portable medical market 
gaining better access to this attractive market was one of the main drivers behind our acquisition of micro power as it provides us with a significant opportunity for growth given its million market size 
additionally  this market is benefiting from favorable market trends as patient care shifts from clinical settings to the home and as an aging population drives the need for lightweight and portable devices for patients and caregivers 
these favorable trends are expected to allow this market to grow faster than our legacy markets over the next several years 
finally  this market is also attractive to us given that it has long product life cycles that should provide stability and diversification to our revenue base 
government regulation the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education affordability reconciliation act collectively health care reform legislated broad based changes to the us health care system that could significantly impact our business operations and financial results  including higher or lower revenue  as well as higher employee medical costs and taxes 
health care reform imposes significant new taxes on medical device oems  which will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry and which could have a material negative impact on our financial condition  results of operations and our cash flows 
other elements of health care reform such as comparative effectiveness research  an independent payment advisory board  payment system reforms including shared savings pilots and other provisions could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered  and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business  results of operations and financial condition 
many significant parts of health care reform will be phased in over the next several years and require further guidance and clarification in the form of regulations 
management is currently evaluating the impact that the new medical device tax will have on our results from operations beginning in  and has preliminarily estimated that it will reduce gross profit by million to million 
this amount assumes that this tax applies to the first medical device sale in the us and is based upon a wholesale price 

table of contents on august   the us securities and exchange commission sec issued a rule under section of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act requiring companies to publicly disclose their use of conflict minerals that originated in the democratic republic of the congo drc or an adjoining country 
under the adopted rule  issuers are required to conduct a reasonable due diligence process to ascertain the source of conflict minerals  defined as tantalum  tin  gold or tungsten  that are necessary to the functionality or production of their manufactured or contracted to be manufactured products 
companies are required to provide this disclosure on a new form to be filed with the sec called form sd 
companies are required to file form sd on may  for the calendar period and annually on may every year thereafter 
we anticipate additional  new compliance costs to be incurred since our implantable medical business utilizes all of the minerals specified in the rule  which we are unable to quantify at this time 
our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
valuation of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets when we acquire a company  we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair value at the date of acquisition 
some of our intangible assets are considered non amortizing intangible assets as they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely 
goodwill is recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
indefinite lived intangibles and goodwill are not amortized but are required to be assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequent if certain indicators are present 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are assessed for impairment if certain indicators are present 
assumptions approach used we base the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
the fair values of the assets acquired are determined using one of three valuation approaches market  income or cost 
the selection of a particular method depends on the reliability of available data and the nature of the asset 
the market approach values the asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets 
the income approach values the asset based on the present value of risk adjusted cash flows projected to be generated by that asset 
the projected cash flows for each asset considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  attrition trends  reasonable contract renewal assumptions from the perspective of a marketplace participant  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
the cost approach values the asset by determining the current cost of replacing that asset with another of equivalent economic utility 
the cost to replace the asset reflects the estimated reproduction or replacement cost  less an allowance for loss in value due to depreciation or obsolescence  with specific consideration given to economic obsolescence if indicated 

table of contents we perform an annual review on the last day of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
we assess goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying value to determine if there is potential impairment 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
fair values for reporting units are determined based on the income and market approaches 
indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by using the income approach 
definite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if any conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
we do not believe that the indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill allocated to our implantable medical or electrochem segments are at risk of failing step one of future annual impairment tests unless operating conditions significantly deteriorate  given the significant amount that our estimated fair value for these assets was in excess of their respective book values as of december   or if there is a change in our reporting units 
effect of variation of key assumptions used the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could impact the value of the assets and liabilities recorded  which would change the amount and timing of future intangible asset amortization expense 
we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the expected future cash flows of our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
these include discount rates  terminal values and projections of future revenues and expenses 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could create future impairment losses to our goodwill 
the assumptions used in our impairment test incorporate the information disclosed in financial guidance of this section as well as other forward looking statements made in this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 
for our indefinite lived intangible assets  we make estimates of royalty rates  future revenues and discount rates 
significant changes in these estimates could create future impairments of these assets 
estimation of the useful lives of indefinite and definite lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated cash flows of the respective intangible asset and requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates of the useful lives 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future amortization expense or could create future impairments of these intangible assets 
the way the company s management allocates resources and evaluates its businesses determines the reporting unit level which goodwill is tested for impairment 
significant changes to these reporting units could create future impairments of goodwill 

table of contents as of december   we have million of intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet representing of total assets 
this includes million of amortizing intangible assets  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of goodwill 
a change in the amortization of our intangible assets would change net income loss by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
stock based compensation we record compensation costs related to our stock based awards which include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
compensation cost for service based awards is recognized ratably over the applicable vesting period 
compensation cost for performance awards based on company financial metrics is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
compensation cost for performance awards based on market metrics such as total shareholder return is expensed each period whether the performance metrics are achieved or not 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
the total expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that ultimately vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
assumptions approach used we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
we are required to make certain assumptions with respect to selected black scholes model inputs  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the stock options 
the expected life of stock options granted  which represents the period of time that the stock options are expected to be outstanding  is based  primarily  on historical data 
the expected dividend yield is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period commensurate with the estimated expected life 
the fair value of time based as well as nonmarket based performance restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards is equal to the fair value of the company s stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of market based performance restricted stock unit awards is determined by utilizing a monte carlo simulation model  which projects the value of greatbatch stock versus our peer group under numerous scenarios and determines the value of the award based upon the present value of these projected outcomes 
compensation cost for nonmarket based performance awards is reassessed each period and recognized based upon the probability that the performance targets will be achieved 
that assessment is based upon actual and expected future performance 
stock based compensation expense is recorded for those awards that are expected to vest  as well as market and nonmarket performance award considerations 
forfeiture estimates for determining appropriate stock based compensation expense are estimated at the time of grant based on historical experience and demographic characteristics 
revisions are made to those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from estimated forfeitures 

table of contents effect of variation of key assumptions used option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  existing valuation models may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting assumptions to be utilized to determine fair value and forfeiture assumptions 
if factors change and result in different assumptions in future periods  the expense that we record for future grants may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
additionally  changes in performance of the company and its stock price will affect the likelihood that performance based targets are achieved and could materially impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
a change in our stock based compensation expense would change net income loss by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
assumptions approach used inventory costing requires complex calculations that include assumptions for overhead absorption  scrap  sample calculations  manufacturing yield estimates and the determination of which costs may be capitalized 
the valuation of inventory requires us to estimate obsolete or excess inventory  as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality 
effect of variation of key assumptions used variations in methods or assumptions could have a material impact on our results 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs or expense a greater amount of overhead costs  which would have a negative impact on our net income 
as of december   we have million of inventory recorded on our consolidated balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down of our inventory would change net income loss by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents tangible long lived assets property  plant and equipment and other tangible long lived assets are carried at cost 
the cost of property  plant and equipment is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets primarily using straight line rates 
tangible long lived assets are subject to impairment assessment if certain indicators are present 
assumptions approach used we assess the impairment of tangible long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market price of the asset asset group  a significant change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset asset group is being used or in its physical condition  a significant change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset asset group  including an action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset asset group  or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recoverability potential is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset asset group to the related total future undiscounted cash flows 
the projected cash flows for each asset asset group considers multiple factors  including current revenue from existing customers  proceeds from the sale of the asset asset group  reasonable contract renewal assumptions  and expected profit margins giving consideration to historical and expected margins 
if an asset s assets group s carrying value is not recoverable through related cash flows  the asset asset group is considered to be impaired 
impairment is measured by comparing the asset s asset group s carrying amount to its fair value 
when it is determined that useful lives of assets are shorter than originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of depreciation in order to fully depreciate the assets over their shorter useful lives 
effect of variation of key assumptions used estimation of the cash flows and useful lives of tangible assets that are long lived requires significant management judgment 
events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter the assumptions regarding the ability to realize the return of our investment in long lived assets or the useful lives 
also  as we make manufacturing process conversions and other facility consolidation decisions  we must make subjective judgments regarding the remaining cash flows and useful lives of our assets  primarily manufacturing equipment and buildings 
significant changes in these estimates and assumptions could change the amount of future depreciation expense or could create future impairments of these long lived assets asset groups 
as of december  we have million of tangible long lived assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet representing of total assets 
a write down in our tangible long lived assets would change net income loss by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents provision for income taxes our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes for the expected future tax consequences of net operating losses  credits  and temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
assumptions approach used in recording the provision for income taxes  management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of temporary differences based upon the timing of expected reversal 
also  estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for income taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
alternatively  we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when we believe that certain tax positions do not meet the more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of a tax audit or the lapse of statutes of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
effect of variation of key assumptions used changes could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby changing the income tax provision 
also  significant declines in taxable income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and a valuation allowance of million has been established for certain deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
a change in the effective tax rate would impact the current year provision for income taxes by million  and diluted earnings loss per share by per diluted share

during  cardiac and neuromodulation sales benefited from further adoption of our q series batteries partially offset by the timing of customer inventory builds and product launches between and management remains cautiously optimistic over the short term prospects of this product line given the continued ongoing challenges surrounding some of our key cardiac customers 
it is important to note that our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a short period of time and that any significant customer field actions or relative market share shifts among oem manufacturers could impact our results 
we believe that the impact of these factors is somewhat muted by the fact that we have business with all of the key cardiac oems and have significantly diversified our revenue base 
additionally  we continue to see an increased pace of product development opportunities from our customers 
management believes that this  combined with our increased focus on sales and marketing  will allow the company to grow this product line faster than the underlying market 
for  our vascular product line sales increased to million 
this increase was primarily attributable to growth in the underlying market and market share gains 
additionally  vascular revenue for the year included million from sales of medical devices that were developed under the greatbatch name compared to million for  an increase of 
orthopaedic product line sales for declined compared to the same period of on a constant currency basis  orthopaedic sales declined for as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations decreased orthopaedic revenue by approximately million 
the remaining decline in orthopaedic sales was a result of price concessions provided to customers  as well as fewer customer product launches and development opportunities due to operational issues at our swiss orthopaedic facilities  which were aggressively addressed in in addition to the consolidation of manufacturing  during  we also streamlined our swiss orthopaedic product line offerings 
this included the sale of several non core product lines to an independent third party near the end of the year  which closed in early our current estimate is that the sale of these products will reduce our orthopaedic revenue by approximately million in comparison to for  we expect our performance to improve as we progress through the year  as the first quarter of will be impacted by the startup of these recently transferred orthopaedic production lines 
the second half of the year is expected to improve as this orthopaedic backlog is relieved 

table of contents our implantable medical customers have various inventory management  dual sourcing  and vertical integration initiatives in place  and the relative market share among oem manufacturers changes continuously 
additionally  we face pricing pressures from our customers and in particular our four largest oem customers upon which a significant portion of our sales is dependent 
these pressures have increased over the last several years due to the downturn in the global economy  and more specifically  the contracting crm market 
consequently  these and other factors will continue to significantly impact our sales 
electrochem sales for electrochem increased million to million 
electrochem sales included million of incremental revenue related to the acquisition of micro power in december on an organic basis  electrochem revenue was consistent with the prior year 
during  the micro power acquisition exceeded our expectations  which is benefitting from successful product launches into the higher growth  higher value portable medical market 
the market shift in patient care from clinical settings to the home  and an aging population  is driving the need for lightweight and portable devices for patients and caregivers 
electrochem s technology  customer relationships  and legacy of delivering highly reliable and innovative solutions has enabled it to win in this evolving market and continues to position electrochem to capture market share 
electrochem continues to secure long term agreements in this space and our funnel of portable medical products from this acquisition continues to be full  which is expected to drive revenue growth for this product line for the next several years

we estimate that the benefit related to the r d tax credits will be approximately million 
there is a potential for volatility of the effective tax rate due to several factors  including changes in the mix of pre tax income and the jurisdictions to which it relates  business acquisitions  settlements with taxing authorities and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations
