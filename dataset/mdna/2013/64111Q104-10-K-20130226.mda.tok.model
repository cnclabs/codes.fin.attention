item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the forward looking statements are not historical facts  but rather are based on current expectations  estimates  assumptions and projections about our industry  business and future financial results 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed under risk factors in part i  item a above 
business and executive overview we are a global networking company that delivers innovative products to consumers  businesses and service providers 
our products are built on a variety of proven technologies such as wireless  ethernet and powerline  with a focus on reliability and ease of use 
our product line consists of wired and wireless devices that enable networking  broadband access and network connectivity 
these products are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of our end users in each geographic region in which our products are sold 
we operate in three specific business segments retail  commercial  and service provider 
the retail business unit consists of high performance  dependable and easy to use home networking  home monitoring  storage and digital media products to connect consumers with the internet and their content and devices 
the commercial business unit consists of business networking  storage and security solutions without the cost and complexity of big it 
the service provider business unit consists of made to order and retail proven  whole home networking solutions sold to service providers for sale to their customers 
we conduct business across three geographic regions americas  europe  middle east and africa emea and asia pacific apac 
we sell our networking products through multiple sales channels worldwide  including traditional retailers  online retailers  wholesale distributors  direct market resellers dmrs  value added resellers vars  and broadband service providers 
our retail channel includes traditional retail locations domestically and internationally  such as apple stores  best buy  costco  fry s electronics  k mart  microsoft stores  radio shack  sears  staples  target  wal mart  argos uk  dixons uk  pc world uk  mediamarkt germany  austria  dick smith australia  jb hifi australia and elkjop norway 
online retailers include amazon 
com  dell  newegg 
com and buy 
com 
our dmrs include cdw corporation  insight corporation and pc connection in domestic markets and misco throughout europe 
in addition  we also sell our products through broadband service providers  such as multiple system operators msos  dsl  and other broadband technology operators domestically and internationally 
some of these retailers and broadband service providers purchase directly from us  while others are fulfilled through wholesale distributors around the world 
a substantial portion of our net revenue to date has been derived from a limited number of wholesale distributors and retailers  including ingram micro and best buy 
we expect that these wholesale distributors and retailers will continue to contribute a significant percentage of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 
we experienced revenue growth of during fiscal on a geographic basis  the increase was led by net revenue growth in the americas and apac regions  however  the emea region continued to see macroeconomic weakness in the european market  with net revenues decreasing by year over year 
on a segment basis  our service provider business unit continued to drive revenue growth  largely driven by demand for our docsis products 
net revenues also increased in our retail business unit  driven by increased sales of home wireless products 
however  we experienced a decrease in net revenues from our commercial business unit  as the business unit was affected by the european macroeconomic environment 
in  we continued to grow the business  completing the acquisition of avaak inc avaak  a privately held company that developed wire free video networking products  and acquiring certain intellectual property of firetide  inc firetide 
we believe the acquisition of avaak will bolster our retail business unit product offerings and expand our presence into the smart home market  and the acquisition of firetide will bolster our wireless product offerings in our commercial business unit and strengthen our market position in the small to medium size campus wireless lan market 
furthermore  we increased our investment in research and development  particularly software development  increasing research and development expense to of net revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  we believe this investment in software development will enable us to provide powerful differentiation against our competition and also provide us with possible entries into new product categories in the future 
our service provider business has grown substantially and it is difficult to ascertain a seasonal pattern given that the business is less predictable than our other core businesses 
the commercial business  consumer  and broadband service provider markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the retail  commercial  and service provider markets for networking products include product breadth  size and scope of the sales channel  
table of contents brand name  timeliness of new product introductions  product availability  performance  features  functionality and reliability  ease of installation  maintenance and use  and customer service and support 
to remain competitive  we believe we must continue to aggressively invest resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products while continuing to expand our channels and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide 
looking forward  we expect the service provider business unit to grow at a slower pace  before consideration of our pending acquisition of the sierra wireless  inc sierra wireless aircard business 
for further detail  refer to note  subsequent event  in notes to consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this annual report on form k 
we expect to see continued success in our retail business unit  driven by ac wireless technology and our expansion into new technology areas  including over the top content streaming with our neotv line of products  and home monitoring with our vuezone cameras  wifi repeaters and other smart home solutions and we believe that the rapid growth of this market will drive revenue growth 
we also expect to see growth in our commercial business unit  driven by our newer products in gig ethernet switches  unified storage  and campus wireless lan targeting the move into the hybrid cloud and access network environment among small and medium enterprises 
in addition  we will continue to closely manage our expenses  inventory  and cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the sec 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we have listed below our critical accounting policies that we believe to have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
revenue recognition refer to note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized at the time the product is shipped  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
currently  for some of our customers  title passes to the customer upon delivery to the port or country of destination  upon their receipt of the product  or upon the customer s resale of the product 
at the end of each fiscal quarter  we estimate and defer revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
the revenue continues to be deferred until such time that title passes to the customer 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to estimate deferred revenue related to product where title has not transferred 
we do not believe there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used in our estimate of deferred revenue 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors  including general economic and market conditions  past transaction history with the customer  and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection of the corresponding receivable is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue until receipt of payment 
allowances for product warranties  returns due to stock rotation  sales incentives and doubtful accounts our standard warranty obligation to our direct customers generally provides for a right of return of any product for a full refund in the event that such product is not merchantable or is found to be damaged or defective 
at the time revenue is recognized  an estimate of future warranty returns is recorded to reduce revenue in the amount of the expected credit or refund to be provided to our direct customers 
at the time we record the reduction to revenue related to warranty returns  we include within cost of revenue a write down to reduce the carrying value of such products to net realizable value 
our standard warranty obligation to end users provides for replacement of a defective product for one or more years 
factors that affect the warranty obligation include product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
the estimated cost associated with fulfilling the warranty obligation to end users is recorded in cost of revenue 
because our products are manufactured by third party manufacturers  in certain cases we have recourse to the third party manufacturer for replacement or credit for the defective products 
we give consideration to amounts recoverable from our third party manufacturers in determining our warranty liability 
our estimated allowances for product warranties can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions or charges to cost of revenue  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents in addition to warranty related returns  certain distributors and retailers generally have the right to return product for stock rotation purposes 
upon shipment of the product  we reduce revenue for an estimate of potential future stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for our products when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  namely stock rotation returns 
our estimated allowances for returns due to stock rotation can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional revenue reductions  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
we accrue for sales incentives as a marketing expense if we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the identifiable benefit received  otherwise  it is recorded as a reduction of revenues 
our estimated provisions for sales incentives can vary from actual results and we may have to record additional expenses or additional revenue reductions dependent on the classification of the sales incentive 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we regularly perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and consider factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balances  and geographic or country specific risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed quarterly and adjusted if necessary based on our assessments of our customers ability to pay 
if the financial condition of our customers should deteriorate or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  additional allowances may be required  which could have an adverse impact on operating expenses 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we continually assess the value of our inventory and will periodically write down its value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and on order under non cancelable purchase commitments  including consignment inventory  in comparison to our estimated forecast of product demand for the next nine months to determine what inventory  if any  are not saleable 
our analysis is based on the demand forecast but takes into account market conditions  product development plans  product life expectancy and other factors 
based on this analysis  we write down the affected inventory value for estimated excess and obsolescence charges 
at the point of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
as demonstrated during prior years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand and we fail to reduce our manufacturing accordingly  we could be required to write down additional inventory  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit 
goodwill goodwill represents the purchase price over estimated fair value of net assets of businesses acquired in a business combination 
goodwill acquired in a business combination is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter 
should certain events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment tests  we will perform the impairment test as those events or indicators occur 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant decline in the our expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in the business climate  and slower growth rates 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
the qualitative assessment considers the following factors macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall company financial performance  events affecting the reporting units  and changes in our share price 
if the reporting unit does not pass the qualitative assessment  then we estimate our fair value and compare the fair value with the carrying value of our net assets 
if the fair value is greater than the carrying value of our net assets  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than our carrying value  then we would determine the fair value of the goodwill by comparing the implied fair value to the carrying value of the goodwill in the same manner as if we were being acquired in a business combination 
specifically  we would allocate the fair value to all of our assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  in a hypothetical analysis that would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we completed the annual impairment test of goodwill 
we assessed whether it was more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than that each reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying amount 
table of contents including goodwill by considering the following factors macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall company financial performance  events affecting the reporting units  and changes in our share price 
based on these factors  we determined that it is not more likely than not that each reporting unit s fair value was less than its carrying amount  and therefore performing the first step of the two step impairment test for each reporting unit was unnecessary 
no goodwill impairment was recognized in the years ended december   or we do not believe it is likely that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill 
however  if the actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
long lived assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets  which range from four to ten years 
finite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
purchased intangible assets determined to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually during the fourth quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss for indefinite lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
indefinite lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the carrying value of the asset is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts  both internal and external  that may suggest impairment 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance in asu provides the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
calculation of the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset would not be required unless it is determined  based on the qualitative assessment  that it is not more likely than not  the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
asu is effective for annual and interim period intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning on or after september   however early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt the updated standard for the purpose of our intangible asset impairment testing in the fourth fiscal quarter of in the fourth fiscal quarter of  we completed the annual impairment test of long lived assets 
we assessed whether it was more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than the carrying amount of our indefinite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows by considering the following factors macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  cost factors  overall company financial performance  events affecting the reporting units  and changes in our share price 
based on these factors  we determined that it is not more likely than not that there were events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of our indefinite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable from their undiscounted cash flows  and therefore performing the first step of the two step impairment test for each reporting unit was unnecessary 
no impairments to our indefinite lived assets were recognized in the years ended december   and we will continue to evaluate the carrying value of our indefinite lived assets and if we determine in the future that there is a potential further impairment  we may be required to record additional charges to earnings which could affect our financial results 
income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from different treatments for tax versus accounting of certain items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets are recoverable  however  if there were a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we would be required to take a charge in the period in which we determined that recovery was not more likely than not 
uncertain tax provisions are recognized under guidance that provides that a company should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the income tax position taken 
income tax positions that meet the more 
table of contents likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
we include interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional tax expense

we outsource our manufacturing  warehousing and distribution logistics 
we believe this outsourcing strategy allows us to better manage our product costs and gross margin

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million 
our cash and cash equivalents balance decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  our short term investments  which represent the investment of funds available for current operations  increased from million as of december  to million as of december   as we shifted assets from money market funds to treasuries with higher returns 
operating activities during the year ended december   generated cash of million 
investing activities during the year ended december  used million  which includes the net purchases of short term investments of million  payments made in connection with business acquisitions of million  primarily related to the avaak acquisition  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
during the year ended december   financing activities provided million  primarily due to the issuance of our common stock upon exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase program  as well as the excess tax benefit from exercises and cancellations of stock options 
our days sales outstanding as of december  was days  which was consistent with our accounts payable decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily as a result of timing of payments 
inventory increased from million at december  to million at december  ending inventory turns decreased from turns in the three months ended december   to turns in the three months ended december  
table of contents this decrease is primarily attributable to our increased inventory levels to support current and expected demand levels for our products 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts  which typically mature in three to five months  to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations of foreign currency denominated revenue  costs of revenue  certain operating expenses  receivables  payables  and cash balances 
we record on the consolidated balance sheet at each reporting period the fair value of our forward exchange contracts and record any fair value adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations and in our consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on hedge contracts that are non designated under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging are recorded within other income expense  net  offsetting foreign exchange gains and losses on our monetary assets and liabilities 
gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on hedge contracts that are designated cash flow hedges under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging are recorded within cumulative other comprehensive income until the related revenue  costs of revenue  or expenses are recognized 
in october   the board of directors authorized management to repurchase up to  shares of our outstanding common stock 
under this authorization  the timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are at the discretion of management and are contingent on a number of factors  such as levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions and the price of our common stock 
we did not repurchase any shares under this authorization during the years ended december   or we also repurchase shares to help administratively facilitate the withholding and subsequent remittance of personal income and payroll taxes for individuals receiving rsus throughout the year 
we repurchased approximately  shares  or  of common stock to facilitate tax withholdings for rsus during the year ended december  similarly  during the years ended december  and december   we repurchased approximately  shares and  shares  respectively  or  and  of our common stock  respectively  to help facilitate tax withholding for rsus 
these shares were retired upon repurchase 
based on our current plans and market conditions  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot be certain that our planned levels of revenue  costs and expenses will be achieved 
if our operating results fail to meet our expectations or if we fail to manage our inventory  accounts receivable or other assets  we could be required to seek additional funding through public or private financings or other arrangements 
in addition  as we continue to expand our product offerings  channels and geographic presence  we may require additional working capital 
in such event  adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable or commercially acceptable terms  which could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
backlog as of december   we had a backlog of approximately million  compared to approximately million as of december   primarily due to product demand required in the future 
our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment 
while we expect to fulfill the order backlog within the current year  most orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation with little or no penalties 
because of the possibility of customer changes in product scheduling or order cancellation  our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of net sales for any succeeding period 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table describes our commitments to settle non cancelable lease and purchase commitments as of december  less than more than year years years years total operating leases purchase obligations 
table of contents we lease office space  cars and equipment under non cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through december rent expense in the years ended december    and was million  million and million  respectively 
the terms of some of the office leases provide for rental payments on a graduated scale 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease period  and have accrued for rent expense incurred but not paid 
the amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly  unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to exit an office facility early or expand our occupied space 
we enter into various inventory related purchase agreements with suppliers 
generally  under these agreements  of the orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date and of orders are cancelable by giving notice to days prior to the expected shipment date 
orders are not cancelable within days prior to the expected shipment date 
at december   we had million in non cancelable purchase commitments with suppliers 
we expect to sell all products for which we have committed purchases from suppliers 
as of december  and december   we had million and million  respectively  of total gross unrecognized tax benefits and related interest 
the timing of any payments that could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend upon a number of factors 
the unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table because reasonable estimates cannot be made of whether  or when  any cash payments for such items might occur 
the possible reduction in liabilities for uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions that may impact the statement of operations in the next months is approximately million  excluding the interest  penalties and the effect of any related deferred tax assets or liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we have an investment portfolio of fixed income securities that are classified as available for sale securities 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we attempt to limit this exposure by investing primarily in highly rated short term securities 
our investment policy requires investments to be rated triple a with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a movement of by market interest rates would not have a material impact on our operating results and the total value of the portfolio over the next fiscal year 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposure to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
there were no impairment charges on our investments during fiscal foreign currency transaction risk we invoice some of our international customers in foreign currencies including  but not limited to  the australian dollar  british pound  euro  and japanese yen 
as the customers that are currently invoiced in local currency become a larger percentage of our business  or to the extent we begin to bill additional customers in foreign currencies  the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could have a more significant impact on our results of operations 
for those customers in our international markets that we continue to sell to in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and therefore reduce the demand for our products 
such a decline in the demand for our products could reduce sales and negatively impact our operating results 
certain operating expenses of our foreign operations require payment in the local currencies 

table of contents we are exposed to risks associated with foreign exchange rate fluctuations due to our international sales and operating activities 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 
we began using foreign currency forward contract derivatives in the fourth quarter of to partially offset our business exposure to foreign exchange risk on our foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
additionally  in the second quarter of we began entering into certain foreign currency forward contracts that have been designated as cash flow hedges under the authoritative guidance for derivatives and hedging to partially offset our business exposure to foreign exchange risk on portions of our anticipated foreign currency revenue  costs of revenue  and certain operating expenses 
the objective of these foreign currency forward contracts is to reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results by offsetting gains and losses on the forward contracts with increases or decreases in foreign currency transactions 
the contracts are marked to market on a monthly basis with gains and losses included in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations  and in cumulative other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
we do not use foreign currency contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
hedging of our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow exposures may not always be effective to protect us against currency exchange rate fluctuations 
in addition  we do not fully hedge our balance sheet and anticipated cash flow exposures  leaving us at risk to foreign exchange gains and losses on the un hedged exposures 
if there were an adverse movement in exchange rates  we might suffer significant losses 
see note  derivative financial instruments  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on our foreign currency contracts  which are hereby incorporated by reference into this part ii  item a 
as of december   we had net assets in various local currencies 
a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates would result in an after tax positive or negative impact of million to net income  net of our hedged position  at december  actual future gains and losses associated with our foreign currency exposures and positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed as of december  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the foreign currency exchange rates  and our actual exposures and positions 
for the year ended december   of total net revenue was denominated in a currency other than the us dollar
