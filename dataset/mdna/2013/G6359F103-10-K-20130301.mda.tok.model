item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management overview this section is intended to help you understand our results of operations and our financial condition 
this information is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto 
we have grown from a land drilling business centered in the us lower states  canada and alaska to an international business with operations on land and offshore in most of the major oil and gas markets in the world 
our worldwide fleet of actively marketed rigs consists of land drilling rigs  rigs for land well servicing and workover work in the united states and canada  offshore platform rigs  jackup units  barge rigs and a large component of trucks and fluid hauling vehicles 
we have investments in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities in the united states and canada  but are marketing to dispose of our oil and gas portfolio in an expeditious and prudent manner 
the majority of our business is conducted through two business lines our drilling rig services business line includes our drilling operations for oil and natural gas wells  on land and offshore  and companies engaged in drilling technology  top drive manufacturing  directional drilling  construction services  and rig instrumentation and software 
this business line  consisting of six operating segments  includes us lower land drilling  us offshore  alaska  canada  and international operations 
our us lower land drilling and international operating segments also represent reportable segments based on quantitative thresholds 
in addition  our other rig services operating segment combines canrig drilling technology ltd  peak oilfield services and ryan directional services  inc the latter operating segment does not meet the criteria for disclosure  individually or in the aggregate  as a reportable segment 
our completion production services business line includes our well servicing  fluid logistics  workover operations and our pressure pumping services 
this business line  consisting of two operating segments  includes us production services and completion services  and represents reportable segments 
our businesses depend  to a large degree  on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  development and production activities 
a sustained increase or decrease in the price of oil or natural gas could materially impact exploration  development and production activities  and consequently  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the magnitude of customer spending on new and existing wells is the primary driver of our business 
our customers spending is determined principally by their internally generated cash flow and to a lesser extent by joint venture arrangements and funding from the capital markets 
in our drilling rig services business line  operations have traditionally been driven by natural gas prices  but the majority of current activity is driven by the price of oil and natural gas liquids from unconventional reservoirs shales 
in our completion production services business line  operations are primarily driven by oil prices 
during  domestic ongoing weak natural gas prices  combined with a general decline in natural gas liquids and a mid year sharp  but temporary  drop in crude oil prices  resulted in a second half contraction in customer spending 
this led to a curtailment of drilling related expenditures by many companies and an oversupply of rigs in the markets where we operate 
we believe gas and liquids prices are likely to remain weak through crude oil pricing has been more resilient  but remains volatile and potentially vulnerable  which keeps our customers forward spending plans in check for the near term 
projections of stable crude oil pricing at today s level and improving liquids pricing later in the year  if realized  should lead to increased domestic drilling activity later in nonetheless  it is also likely that continuing additions of new rig capacity and improving rig efficiency will result in a continued oversupply of rigs for most  if not all  of the year 
our international markets have been much slower to respond to the improving oil prices of the last two years and continue to be dampened by cost issues in several markets which should abate as the year progresses 
this abatement  combined with a general tightening of the rig supply demand balance  leading to improving rates  and the deployment of several large projects and other rigs returning to work should improve international results in the following table sets forth oil and natural gas price data per bloomberg for the last three years year ended december  increase decrease to to commodity prices average henry hub natural gas spot price thousand cubic feet mcf average west texas intermediate crude oil spot price barrel

during  our income loss from continuing operations was negatively impacted by impairments and other charges  including full cost ceiling test writedowns from nfr energy totalling million  representing our proportionate share of the writedowns  a million impairment of an intangible asset related to the superior trade name  a provision for the retirement of long lived assets totaling million in multiple operating segments  a million impairment of some coil tubing rigs and a goodwill impairment totaling million 
partially offsetting these charges were million of asset gains  primarily relating to selling our interest in nfr energy at the end of excluding these items  our operating results improved as a result of increased demand for our services and products due to increased drilling activity in oil and liquids rich shale plays and increased well servicing activity in the us and canada 
this increase in activity has more than offset the drop in demand from gas related plays 
during  operating results improved as compared to primarily due to the incremental revenue and positive operating results from the addition of our completion services operating segment beginning in september  increased drilling activity in oil and liquids rich shale plays in our drilling operations in both our us lower land and canada drilling business units and increased well servicing activity in the us and canada 
however  our operating results and activity levels were negatively impacted in our us offshore operations in response to uncertainty in the regulatory environment in the gulf of mexico  our alaskan operations due to key customers spending constraints  and in saudi arabia due to downtime and reduced rates on several jackup rigs 
our income from continuing operations during was negatively impacted by million in impairments and other charges  million of which related to a provision for a contingent liability that existed on december  for a potential termination payment to our former chief executive officer  which was not paid 
see note for further discussion 
the remaining million was comprised of a provision for retirement of long lived assets recorded by multiple operating segments 
this related to the decommissioning and retirement of assets previously utilized in our us lower land drilling  international and us production services operations and the amounts are reflected in the impairments and other charges line in our consolidated statements of income loss

adjusted income loss derived from operating activities is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization and earnings losses from the us oil and gas joint venture from the sum of operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates 
these amounts should not be used as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with gaap 
however  management evaluates the performance of our business units and the consolidated company based on several criteria  including adjusted income loss derived from operating activities  because it believes that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  which is a gaap measure  is provided in the above table

us lower land drilling 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years operating results increased from to primarily due to higher average dayrates and a slight increase in drilling activity  as well as million in revenues recognized that were related to early contract terminations 
these increases were partially offset by higher depreciation expense related to new rigs placed into service during operating results increased from to primarily due to higher average dayrates and increases in drilling activity  driven by deployment of rigs into oil and liquids rich shale areas 
the increase was partially offset by higher operating costs associated with increased drilling activity  as well as higher depreciation expense related to new rigs placed into service since january us offshore 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years operating revenues increased from to resulting primarily from higher utilization for the supersundownertm platform rigs and the mods rigs 
the increase was partially offset by declining activities for the sundowner platform rigs in our shallow water areas 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to primarily due to the sundowner platform rigs discussed above and profit reduction on a construction project 
operating revenues increased from to as a result of higher workover activities by the sundowner platform and jackup rigs and from profits related to a major construction project 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to primarily due to lower utilization for the mods rigs and supersundownertm platform rigs 
drilling permits have been subject to a lengthy and stringent safety and environmental review process since the gulf of mexico blowout in mid 
table of contents alaska 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years the increases in operating results from to were due to higher average dayrates and increased drilling activity  driven primarily by an overall increase in winter exploration activity in the first and second quarters of  as well as increased camp activity and margins 
the decreases in operating results from to were primarily due to lower average dayrates and drilling activity 
while drilling activity levels decreased significantly during  operating results decreased only slightly due to the acceleration of recognized deferred revenues from a significant contract that terminated 
canada 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years rig hours operating revenues decreased slightly from to primarily as a result of decreases in drilling and well servicing activity  partially offset by increased drilling dayrates 
adjusted income derived from operating activities increased from to due to these higher dayrates  which offset the decreases in drilling and well servicing activities 
the current natural gas oversupply in north america  and resulting low natural gas prices  decreased customer demand for gas drilling and well servicing activity in reduced natural gas drilling activity was largely offset by increased demand in oil exploration in strong oil prices caused growth in oil drilling activity and increased drilling dayrates  with more demand for larger rigs required to drill long reach horizontal wells in the shale plays and the oil sands 
direct costs and general and adminstrative expenses for were in line with costs 
operating results increased from to primarily as a result of increases in drilling and well servicing activity and drilling dayrates and well servicing hourly rates 
the increased drilling and well servicing activity in western canada is the result of renewed interest in oil exploration  supported by strong oil commodity prices 
operating results were negatively impacted by higher drilling costs for well servicing in for preparing service rigs for high utilization and additional labor costs for crew travel  retention and training 

table of contents international 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig years operating revenues and earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased from to and from to as a result of increases in the utilization of our overall rig fleet albeit at lower margins 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to primarily from the decreases in average dayrates and lower utilization of our jackup rigs in saudi arabia and lower offshore activity in congo 
these decreases were partially offset by new activity in papua  new guinea and increased utilization of rigs in mexico 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased from to primarily from the decreases in average dayrates and lower utilization of our jackup rigs in saudi arabia and other drilling activities in qatar and australia 
other rig services 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages operating revenues and earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities the increase in operating results from to and from to primarily resulted from higher demand in the united states and canada drilling markets for top drives  rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies and higher third party rental and rigwatch units  which generate higher margins  partially offset by a continued decline in customer demand for our construction services in alaska

the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages and rig activity operating revenues earnings losses from unconsolidated affiliates adjusted income derived from operating activities rig hours operating results increased from to and from to primarily due to increases in rig and truck utilization facilitated by capital invested to increase rig and truck fleets as well as frac tank counts 
equipment utilization and price improvements experienced in and were primarily driven by sustained higher oil prices 
completion services 
the results of operations for this segment were as follows year ended december  increase decrease to to in thousands  except percentages operating revenues adjusted income derived from operating activities operating revenues increased from to primarily due to the increased levels of fracturing activity and associated increase in our assets deployed in the major producing areas in the united states 
adjusted income derived from operating activities decreased due to lower margins on product sales as a result of higher commodity prices
