overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing novel immunotherapeutic products to improve cancer treatment options for patients and physicians 
our portfolio includes biologic and small molecule immunotherapy product candidates intended to treat a wide range of oncology indications 
our lead product candidate  hyperacute pancreas cancer immunotherapy  or hyperacute pancreas algenpantucel l  is being studied in a phase clinical trial in surgically resected pancreatic cancer patients that is being performed under a special protocol assessment  or spa  with the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
we initiated this trial based on encouraging interim phase data that suggests improvement in both disease free and overall survival 
we have also received fast track and orphan drug designations from the fda for this product candidate for the adjuvant treatment of surgically resected pancreatic cancer 
we are also studying algenpantucel l in a recently launched phase study in patients whose pancreatic cancer is locally advanced 
we have three additional product candidates in clinical development  including our hyperacute lung cancer immunotherapy  or tergenpumatucel l  which was studied in a phase clinical trial at the national cancer institute  or nci  and is currently being studied in a multi center randomized  controlled phase b clinical trial and our hyperacute melanoma cancer immunotherapy  or hyperacute melanoma  which was studied in an investigator initiated phase clinical trial and is in planning for multiple phase clinical trials 
to date  our hyperacute product candidates have been dosed in more than cancer patients either as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies and have demonstrated a favorable safety profile 
our hyperacute product candidates are based on our proprietary hyperacute immunotherapy technology  which is designed to stimulate the human immune system 
our hyperacute product candidates use allogeneic non patient specific cells from previously established cell lines rather than cells derived from the patient 
we believe our approach enables a simpler  more consistent and scalable manufacturing process than therapies based on patient specific tissues or cells 
our product candidates are designed with an objective to harness multiple components of the innate immune system to combat cancer  either as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatment regimens  without incremental toxicity 
we are also conducting small molecule based research and development with an aim to produce new drugs capable of breaking the immune system tolerance to cancer through inhibition of the indoleamine  dioxygenase  or ido  pathway 
we are currently studying our lead ido pathway inhibitor product candidate  indoximod methyl d tryptophan  or d mt  in collaboration with the nci  in two phase b clinical trials 
we are also studying indoximod in a phase study in patients with advanced prostate cancer and plan to study indoximod in a phase study in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in addition  we are engaged in the preclinical development of nlg  a potent ido pathway inhibitor with a different mechanism of action than indoximod 
we believe that our immunotherapeutic technologies will enable us to discover  develop and commercialize multiple product candidates that can be used either alone or in combination with other therapies to treat cancer 
we are a development stage company and have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred a net loss of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect our losses to increase over the next several years as we advance into late stage clinical trials and pursue regulatory approval of our product candidates 
in addition  if one or more of our product candidates are approved for marketing  we will incur significant expenses for the initiation of commercialization activities 
on october   the company filed a certificate of amendment of the restated certificate of incorporation with the secretary of state of delaware effecting a for one reverse split of its common stock 
all share and per share amounts have been retroactively restated in the accompanying financial statements and notes for all periods presented 

table of contents initial public offering and follow on offering on november   we completed our initial public offering  or ipo  raising a total of million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and offering expenses of million 
on february   we completed a follow on public offering  raising a total of million after deducting million in underwriter discounts and commissions and offering expenses of  financial overview revenues from our inception through december   we have not generated any revenue from product sales 
we have generated million in grant revenue from our inception through december   which is primarily attributable to research and development being performed by our subsidiary  bioprotection systems corporation  or bps  under contracts and grants with the department of defense  or dod  and the national institutes of health  or nih 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a variety of sources  including product sales if we develop products which are approved for sale  license fees  and milestone  research and development and royalty payments in connection with strategic collaborations or licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursements  milestone and other payments we may receive under potential strategic collaborations  and the amount and timing of payments we may receive upon the sale of any products  if approved  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales for several years  if ever 
if we fail to complete the development of our product candidates in a timely manner or to obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  which include salaries  bonuses  benefits and share based compensation  the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials  expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations  investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical studies  facilities  depreciation of fixed assets and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of research facilities and equipment  license fees for and milestone payments related to in licensed products and technology  and costs associated with non clinical activities and regulatory approvals 
we expense research and development expenses as incurred 
product candidates in late stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development  primarily due to the increased size  duration and complexity of later stage clinical trials 
we plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we seek to complete development of our most advanced product candidates  and to further advance our earlier stage research and development projects 
for the years ended december   and and from our inception through december   we have incurred million  million  million and million  respectively  in research and development expenses 
the following tables summarize our research and development expenses for the periods indicated 
table of contents research and development expenses by product in thousands years ended december  cumulative from june  inception through december  hyperacute immunotherapy technology ido pathway inhibitor technology other research and development total research and development expenses research and development expenses by category in thousands years ended december  cumulative from june  inception through december  compensation equipment  supplies and occupancy outside clinical and other total research and development expenses at this time  we cannot accurately estimate or know the nature  specific timing or costs necessary to complete clinical development activities for our product candidates 
we are subject to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing biopharmaceutical products including the uncertain cost and outcome of ongoing and planned clinical trials  the possibility that the fda or another regulatory authority may require us to conduct clinical or non clinical testing in addition to trials that we have planned  rapid and significant technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  evolving industry standards in the life sciences industry and our future need for additional capital 
in addition  we currently have limited clinical data concerning the safety and efficacy of our product candidates 
a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our product candidates could result in a significant change in the costs and timing of our research and development expenses 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  business development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise associated with research and development expenses  intellectual property prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase over the next several years for  among others  the following reasons we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase as a result of increased payroll  expanded infrastructure and higher consulting  legal  auditing and tax services and investor relations costs  and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company  we expect to incur increased general and administrative expenses to support our research and development activities  which we expect to expand as we continue to advance the clinical development of our product candidates  and 
table of contents we may also begin to incur expenses related to the planned sales and marketing of our product candidates  including recruiting a specialty sales force  in anticipation of commercial launch before we receive regulatory approval  if any  of a product candidate 
interest income and interest expense interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit 
the primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation 
we expect our interest income to vary based on our cash balances 
interest expense consists primarily of interest  amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our loans payable 
tax loss carryforwards the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
the net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended december  and was an increase of million and million  respectively 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
valuation allowances have been established for the entire amount of the net deferred tax assets as of december  and  due to the uncertainty of future recoverability 
as of december  and december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million and million and federal research credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  that expire at various dates from through sections and of the internal revenue code limit a corporation s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes including research credits to offset any future taxable income or tax if the corporation experiences a cumulative ownership change of more than over any rolling three year period 
state net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be similarly limited 
an ownership change can therefore result in significantly greater tax liabilities than a corporation would incur in the absence of such a change and any increased liabilities could adversely affect the corporation s business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
based on a preliminary analysis  we believe that  from its inception through december   newlink experienced section ownership changes in september and march and our subsidiary experienced section ownership changes in january and january these ownership changes limit newlink ability to utilize federal net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes that accrued prior to the respective ownership changes of newlink and our subsidiary 
additional analysis will be required to determine whether changes in our ownership since december  and or changes in our ownership that resulted from our follow on offering have caused or will cause another ownership change to occur 
any such change could result in significant limitations on all of our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
even if another ownership change has not occurred  additional ownership changes may occur in the future as a result of events over which we will have little or no control  including purchases and sales of our equity by our stockholders  the emergence of new stockholders  additional equity offerings or redemptions of our stock or certain changes in the ownership of any of our stockholders 
we incurred no income tax expense for the years ended december    and income tax expense differs from the amount that would be expected after applying the statutory united states federal income tax rate primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance for deferred taxes 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates we have prepared our financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
our preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements  as well as revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could therefore differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements included later in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
expenses accrued under contractual arrangements with third parties  accrued clinical expenses as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary 
examples of estimated accrued clinical expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to investigator sites in connection with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials  and fees paid to vendors in connection with preclinical development activities 
we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual accordingly 
although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred  our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period 
stock based compensation stock option valuation 
we are required to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options issued to employees and recognize this cost over the period these awards vest 
prior to our ipo  we estimated the fair value of each option granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected stock price volatility  the calculation of expected term and the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  among other inputs 
generally  we have issued employee awards that vest over time 
for these awards  we record compensation cost on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we issue awards which typically vest to on the first anniversary date of issuance with the remaining options vesting ratably over the next to months  as determined by the board of directors at the time of grant 
we have issued awards to nonemployee consultants and advisers 
all grants to nonemployees are valued using the same fair value method that we use for grants to employees 
the compensation cost on these awards is recognized through the later of the vesting of the award or completion of services by the nonemployee 
we recorded noncash stock based compensation expense for employee and nonemployee stock option grants of million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to nonvested option awards not yet recognized was million and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized was years 
we expect to continue to grant stock options in the future  which will increase our stock based compensation expense in future periods 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents the following table summarizes our assumptions used in the black scholes model for option grants during the last three years black scholes model assumptions years ended december  exercise price expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield exercise price 
prior to the ipo  our stock options were granted with an exercise price at or above the then current fair value of our common stock as determined by the board of directors 
as an input to making this determination  the board of directors obtained a third party valuation 
see common stock fair value below 
subsequent to the ipo  we use the fair value on the date of grant based on the current market price 
expected volatility 
prior to the ipo  we estimated future expected volatility for each stock option valuation utilizing volatility rates of similar publicly traded companies considered to be in the same peer group 
the volatility is calculated over a period of time commensurate with the expected term for the options granted 
we plan to continue using peer group data until we have sufficient information to estimate our own volatility 
expected term in years 
the expected term of a stock option is the period of time for which the option is expected to be outstanding 
we have a large number of options outstanding 
there is no secondary market for our outstanding stock options and they contain only basic terms 
therefore  we used the simplified method of determining expected term by selecting the midpoint between the date upon which the awards would be fully vested in accordance with their terms and the anticipated forfeiture date as the expected term for the employee and non employee director grants 
for other non employee grants  the contractual life of the option was used 
risk free interest rate 
we use the average yield on current united states treasury instruments with terms that approximate the expected term of the stock options being valued 
expected dividend yield 
the expected dividend yield for all of our stock option grants is  as we have not declared a cash dividend since inception  and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
forfeitures 
the stock based compensation expense recognized has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on historical experience of our option plan  which we expect to continue at the current level  and any adjustments in the forfeiture rate in the future will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period that this estimate is changed 
ultimately  the total compensation expense recognized for any given stock based award over its vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
common stock fair value 
due to the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the ipo  the fair value of our common stock for purposes of determining the exercise price for stock option grants prior to the ipo was determined by our board of directors  with the assistance of our management  in good faith based on a number of objective and subjective factors including the prices of our convertible preferred stock sold to outside investors in arms length transactions  and the rights  preferences and privileges of our convertible preferred stock as compared to those of our common stock  including the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock  our results of operations  financial position and the status of our research and development efforts  our stage of development and business strategy  the lack of liquidity of our private stock as a private company  valuations performed by an unrelated valuation specialist prepared in accordance with methodologies outlined in the aicpa technical practice aid  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation  
table of contents the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of our common stock and underlying stock options  such as an initial public offering  given prevailing market conditions  the material risks related to our business  and the composition of and changes to our management team 
the fair value of the common stock was determined by the board of directors in good faith until november   when newlink s common stock initiated trading on nasdaq 
following that date  the fair value of the common stock has been the quoted market price as listed on the public exchange 
fair value estimates after taking into account all of the assumptions and estimates described in our application of the probability weighted expected return method  or pwerm  and the guideline public company  or gpc  method within the market approach  we determined the fair value of our common stock to be approximately per share as of december   approximately per share as of march   approximately per share as of june   approximately per share as of september  and approximately per share as of december  the following table lists grants of options to purchase shares of common stock with gaap measurement dates in  and options granted on shares of common stock approval date gaap measurement date number of shares exercise price per share common stock values intrinsic value per share july  september  august  september  may  september  december  march  march  june  june  october  october  january  december  april  january  january  april  april  april  november  july  november  october  november  october  november  the approval date is the date on which the board of directors authorized  and we had a legal obligation to issue  an option grant 
the gaap measurement date is the first date at which the number of shares and exercise price per share were known and the awards were communicated to all recipients 
the gaap measurement date occurs subsequent to the approval date due to the timing of the completion and approval of third party valuation reports of our common stock 
we utilize the common stock value from the most recent valuation report that has been completed and approved at the time of the gaap measurement date 
due to the significance of the number of option grants on september   management also obtained a third party valuation on that date 
the options granted on october  are not reflected in the footnote disclosure of the financial statements for the period ended december  as the measurement date had not yet occurred under gaap 
the gaap measurement date did not occur until january   which was the date the exercise price per share was determined for accounting purposes based on completion and approval of the september  common stock valuation report and the awards were communicated to all recipients 
the options granted on december   are not reflected in the footnote disclosure of the financial statements for the period ended december  as the measurement date had not yet occurred under gaap 
the gaap measurement date did not occur until april   which was the date the exercise price per share based on completion and approval of the december  common stock valuation report and the awards were communicated to all recipients 
we do not believe the fair value of our common stock on april  was 
table of contents materially different than the value at december   therefore the december  value was used to measure the stock option award 
we do not believe the fair values of our common stock on january  or april  was materially different than the value at december   therefore the december  value was used to measure the stock option award 
based on the december  price of per share  the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding at december   was million  of which million and million related to stock options that were vested and unvested  respectively  at that date 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and revenues

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  up from million for the same period in the million increase was due to a million increase in outside clinical and other expenses including contract development costs for nlg  contract manufacturing costs for indoximod and direct development expenses for our clinical trial activities  accompanied by a  increase in personnel related expenses due to increased staffing levels and compensation increases and a  increase in equipment  supplies and occupancy costs to support our expanding clinical trials

the agreement provided the company with financial assistance for research and product development activities at its iowa state university research park facility 
additionally  under the agreement  the company was obligated to pay a minimum of royalties on all gross revenues of any products the company brings to market with a cumulative maximum royalty amount due of million 
substantially all of the company assets were pledged to secure this loan 
this loan was converted into a royalty obligation under the terms of a settlement agreement entered into on march   with the iowa economic development authority  or the ieda the ieda agreement 
on march   the company entered into the ieda agreement with the iowa economic development authority ieda  as successor in interest to the iowa department of economic development ided 
under the terms of the ieda agreement  the forgivable loan agreement between the company and ieda as successor to ided was terminated and the company was thereby released from the forgivable loan agreement job creation  project expenditure  royalty and other requirements in exchange for agreeing to pay a royalty of on all gross revenues of any products that the company brings to market  with a cumulative maximum royalty obligation due of million 
additionally  under the ieda agreement  the ieda released its security interest in the company assets 
the company is obligated to maintain its business in the state of iowa until the royalty obligation under the ieda agreement is satisfied 
september ided high quality job creation program tax credit in september  we entered into a master contract and associated funding agreement  or hqjc agreement  with the ided under its high quality job creation program 
we amended the hqjc agreement in to extend the dates by which certain job creation and investment requirements were to be met to march  the terms of the hqjc agreement  as amended  require us by march   to make a qualifying investment in real estate or depreciable assets of at least million  to finalize the lease of our new executive offices and manufacturing facilities and to create at least new full time equivalent jobs in iowa of which at least must be high quality  or hqjc jobs 
in order to qualify as high quality jobs  the jobs created must be at a compensation levels that exceed the county average hourly wage of 
we fulfilled two of the three requirements by march  we have made a qualified investment in real estate and finalized the lease of our new offices and manufacturing facility 
as of december   we have created new jobs of which were hqjc jobs 
in addition  we are required to retain the hqjc jobs through march  if we fail to meet this requirement we will be required to repay all tax credits received under the hqjc agreement 
as of december   we had maintained our base employment of full time equivalent jobs in addition to the newly created jobs 
under the hqjc agreement  we received a tax credit of  which was refunded to us between march and october under the hqjc agreement  the ided may require us to repay the entire amount of the tax credit upon certain events of default  which include our experiencing a substantial layoff  relocating a substantial portion of our business or our research and development outside of iowa  failing to offer certain employee benefits or failing to reinvest at least of our pre tax profits from our iowa facility in research and development in iowa 
in addition  prior notice and consent of the ided is required during the term of the hqjc agreement for any material changes in our business or our research and development activities 
march city of ames forgivable loan in march  we entered into a  forgivable loan agreement with the city of ames  iowa and the ames chamber of commerce  jointly  as lenders 
the project provides us with financial assistance to construct new facilities within the ames city limits 
in the absence of a default  there are no principal or interest payments due until the expected completion date for the project  which is march  the project calls for our creating or retaining at least full time jobs located in ames  iowa as of march  and the creation or maintenance of at least full time positions located in ames  iowa as of march  the agreement also calls for our entering into a five year building lease with the option for extension for an additional five years of not less than  square feet within the corporate limits of the city of ames by march  if  as of march   we have fulfilled the terms of the loan agreement  the loan will be forgiven 
if on march  and march   we have failed to create or retain at least full time jobs and full time jobs in ames  iowa  respectively  we will be required to repay approximately  per job not created or retained following the respective date 
as of december   we had created or retained an aggregate 
table of contents of full time jobs in ames  iowa 
as of december    of the total  forgivable loan was advanced to us with the final  pending certification to the city of ames regarding the creation of a threshold level of jobs 
in the event of default  including failure to repay any amounts under the loan when due  we will be required to repay the note  including interest per annum  beginning at the date of default 
operating capital requirements we anticipate that we will continue to generate significant operating losses for the next several years as we incur expenses related to the research and development of our hyperacute immunotherapy and ido pathway inhibitor product candidates  build commercial capabilities and expand our corporate infrastructure 
including the funds received on february  from our follow on offering  we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit to fund our operations through at least the end of we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility if our available cash and cash equivalents are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements or if we develop additional opportunities to do so 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts

table of contents respectively  for a decrease of for the period as compared to the same period in  and a decrease of for the period as compared to the same period in we anticipate these expenses will increase in increased patent costs in as compared to both and were the result of an increase in prosecution activity in multiple patent families

on december   we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the noncontrolling interest in bps  as described in more detail below 
acquisition of bioprotection systems corporation on january   we acquired all of the minority interest in bps  by merging a newly formed subsidiary of ours with bps  with bps as the surviving corporation 
in connection with this transaction  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our series e preferred stock to the former holders of bps series b common stock  bps series a preferred stock and bps series b preferred stock other than the company 
as a result of this transaction  bps became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and our note was converted into series b preferred stock of bps

off balance sheet arrangements we did not have during the periods presented  and we do not currently have  any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under securities and exchange commission  or sec  rules 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  an amendment of the codification topic  comprehensive income 
asu increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income and eliminates the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
asu requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu was adopted by the company effective january  basic and diluted net loss attributable to common stockholders per common share we calculated net loss per share in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  earnings per share 
we determined that our preferred stock outstanding prior to the ipo represented participating securities in accordance with asc however  since we operated at a loss  and losses are not allocated to the preferred stock  the two class method did not affect our calculation of earnings per share 
we had a net loss for all periods presented  accordingly  the inclusion of common stock options and warrants would be anti dilutive 
dilutive common stock equivalents would include the dilutive effect of convertible securities  common stock options  warrants for convertible securities and warrants for common stock equivalents 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents total approximately million  million  and million as of december   and  respectively 
potentially dilutive common stock equivalents were excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for all periods because of their 
table of contents anti dilutive effect 
therefore  the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted earnings per share are the same 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
as of december  and december   we had cash and cash equivalents and certificates of deposit of million and million  respectively  consisting of money market funds  treasury bills and bank certificates of deposit 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
our certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we expect to have the ability to hold our certificates of deposit until maturity  and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments 
we do not currently have any auction rate securities 
our long term debt and our capital lease obligations bear interest at fixed rates 
any change in interest rates would have an immaterial or no impact on our financial statements
