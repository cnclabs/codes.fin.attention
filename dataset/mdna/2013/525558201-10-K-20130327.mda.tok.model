item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other securities and exchange commission filings 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates  and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a medical device company that develops  manufactures  and markets medical devices and implants for the treatment of peripheral vascular disease 
our principal product offerings are sold throughout the world  primarily in the united states  the european union and  to a lesser extent  japan 
we estimate that the annual worldwide market for all peripheral vascular devices approximates billion  within which our core product lines address roughly million 
we have grown our business by using a three pronged strategy competing in niche markets  expanding our worldwide direct sales force  and acquiring and developing complementary vascular devices 
we have used acquisitions as a primary means of further accessing the larger peripheral vascular device market  and we expect to continue to pursue this strategy in the future 
additionally  we have increased our efforts to expand our vascular device offerings through new product development efforts 
we currently manufacture most of our product lines in our burlington  massachusetts  headquarters 
our products are used by vascular surgeons who treat peripheral vascular disease through both open surgical methods and endovascular techniques 
in contrast to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists  neither of whom are certified to perform open surgical procedures  vascular surgeons can perform both open surgical and minimally invasive endovascular procedures  and are therefore uniquely positioned to provide a wider range of treatment options to patients 
our principal product lines include the following balloon catheters  biologic patches  carotid shunts  a contrast injection device  laparoscopic cholecystectomy devices  non occlusive modeling catheters  radiopaque marking tape  remote endarterectomy devices  valvulotomes  vascular grafts  and vessel closure systems 
we divested our aortic stent grafts in june and terminated our distribution of the endologix products in august to assist us in evaluating our business strategies  we regularly monitor long term technology trends in the peripheral vascular device market 
additionally  we consider the information obtained from discussions with the medical community in connection with the demand for our products  including potential new product launches 
we also use this information to help determine our competitive position in the peripheral vascular device market and our manufacturing capacity requirements 

table of contents our business opportunities include the following the long term growth of our sales force in north america  europe and japan  sometimes in connection with terminations of certain distributor relationships in order to expand our sales presence in new countries  the addition of complementary products through acquisitions  the updating of existing products and introduction of new products through research and development  the introduction of our products in new markets upon obtainment of regulatory approvals in these markets  and the consolidation of product manufacturing into our facilities in our burlington  massachusetts corporate headquarters 
we sell our products primarily through a direct sales force 
as of december  our sales force was comprised of sales representatives in north america  the european union and japan 
we also sell our products in other countries through distributors 
our worldwide headquarters is located in burlington  massachusetts 
our international operations are headquartered in sulzbach  germany 
we also have sales offices located in tokyo  japan  toronto  canada  madrid  spain  and milan  italy 
in  approximately of our net sales were generated in markets in which we employ direct sales representatives 
in recent years we have experienced comparatively greater success in product markets characterized by low or limited competition  for example the markets for biologic patches and valvulotome devices 
in the biologic patch market  we believe that we have been able to increase market share 
in the valvulotome market  we believe that we have been able to increase selling prices without compromising market share 
there can be no assurance that we will not meet resistance to increased selling prices in the future 
in contrast  we have experienced comparatively lesser success in highly competitive product markets such as such as prosthetic polyester and eptfe grafts  where we face stronger competition from larger companies with greater resources 
while we believe that these challenging market dynamics can be mitigated by our strong relationships with our vascular surgeon customers  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in highly competitive markets 
because we believe that direct to hospital sales engender closer customer relationships  and allow for higher selling prices and gross margins  we periodically enter into transactions with our distributors to transition their sales of our medical devices to our direct sales organization in october  we entered into a definitive agreement with schaublin medica sa schaublin to terminate its distribution of our products in switzerland effective january  the agreement required us to pay approximately million in exchange for the purchase of their customer list for our products  certain customer contracts  sales and marketing transition services  and minimal inventory 
in december  we entered into a definitive agreement with trytech corporation to terminate its distribution of our products in a certain japanese territory effective as of april  the agreement required us to pay approximately million in exchange for the purchase of their customer list for our products  certain customer contracts  sales and marketing transition services  and minimal inventory 
in march  we began shipping directly to our canadian customers from our sales office in toronto  canada 
we anticipate that the expansion of our direct sales organization in canada and switzerland will result in increased sales and marketing expenses during 
table of contents our strategy for growing our business includes the acquisition of complementary product lines and companies and occasionally the discontinuance or divestiture of products or activities that are no longer complementary in november  we acquired our lifespan eptfe vascular graft from angiotech pharmaceuticals  inc for million and related assets from edwards lifesciences for million 
in june  we divested our taarget and unifit stent grafts to duke vascular  inc for million 
in addition  duke vascular  inc 
assumed our future obligations for the associated unite and entrust clinical trials 
in august  we terminated our distribution of endologix s aortic stent graft products in europe in exchange for million 
in november  we acquired the manufacturing rights manufacturing and distribution rights of the xenosure biologic vascular patch from neovasc  inc for million  having previously been an exclusive distributor of the xenosure biologic vascular patch since in addition to relying upon acquisitions to grow our business  we also rely on our product development efforts to bring differentiated technology and next generation products to market 
these efforts have led to the following recent product developments in december  we launched the over the wire lemaitre valvulotome 
in december  we completed first in man procedures with the multitasc device and the mm lemaitre valvulotome 
these two products are scheduled to launch in mid in addition to our sales growth strategies  we have also executed several operational initiatives designed to consolidate and streamline manufacturing within our burlington  ma facilities 
we expect that these plant consolidations will result in improved control over our production capacity as well as reduced costs over the long term 
our most recent manufacturing transitions included in october  we adopted a reorganization plan that was designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of biomateriali and to improve efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
we have completed the transition of albograft vascular graft manufacturing into our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
in may  we adopted a reorganization plan that was designed to eliminate redundant costs resulting from our acquisition of the lifespan vascular graft and to improve efficiencies in manufacturing operations 
we have completed the transition of lifespan vascular graft manufacturing into our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
in november  we initiated a project to build a third clean room for our newly acquired xenosure biologic patch 
we expect this transition to our burlington facility to continue into the second half of resulting in a negative impact to our gross profit 
once the transition is complete  we expect the gross margins on our xenosure biologic vascular patch to improve beginning in  however  there can be no assurance that these results will be achieved  if at all 
further  the production of the xenosure biological patch will be our first experience in manufacturing biological tissues 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience delays or additional expenses associated with the transfer of this patch and there can be no assurance that our current supply agreement with neovasc will be sufficient to meet sales demand during the transition 
our execution of these business opportunities may affect the comparability of our financial results from period to period and may cause substantial fluctuations from period to period  as we incur related restructuring and other non recurring charges  as well as longer term impacts to revenues and operating expenditures 
for example  in we exited the stent graft business  and realized gains of approximately million in and 
table of contents million in in connection with that exit 
we recognized million of stent graft related revenue during the year ended december   and also incurred sales  marketing  and research and development expenditures in connection with these product lines 
separately  we recognized million and million of restructuring expenses in and  respectively  related to the biomateriali plant closure and relocation to burlington  ma 
in late and again in  we received complaints of the failure of several of our albograft vascular grafts 
in reaction to those failures  we voluntarily recalled two production lots and implemented corrective actions 
subsequent to those recalls  we received several additional complaints in  which we believe were unrelated to the prior product failures 
as a result of the recalled lots  we recognized million of inventory write offs  which we recorded to cost of sales during the year ended december  as a result of the complaints described above  in march  the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom and the national security agency for medicines and health products ansm in france issued prohibition notices  which prohibited our ability to sell albograft vascular grafts in these countries pending our ability to address their concerns 
in july  the ansm rescinded its prohibition notice without qualification  and the mhra rescinded its prohibition notice with the qualification that all albograft devices must be tested prior to implant 
as of january   the mhra removed the prior test qualification in the united kingdom 
the united kingdom and france represented approximately of our albograft vascular graft sales volume in sales of albograft in the united kingdom and france were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  as of december   we have approximately million of inventory and million of intangible assets related to the albograft vascular graft 
see risk factors for the risks associated with the regulatory environment in which we operate 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies  primarily the euro  affect our financial results 
for the year ended december   approximately of our sales were from outside the americas 
we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our sales in the future 
selling  marketing  and administrative costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currency  thereby partially mitigating our transaction risk exposure 
however  most of our foreign sales are denominated in local currency  and if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
net sales and expense components the following is a description of the primary components of our net sales and expenses net sales 
we derive our net sales from the sale of our products  less discounts and returns 
net sales include the shipping and handling fees paid for by our customers 
most of our sales are generated by our direct sales force and are shipped and billed to hospitals or clinics throughout the world 
in countries where we do not have a direct sales force  sales are primarily generated by shipments to distributors who  in turn  sell to hospitals and clinics 
in those cases where our products are held on consignment at a hospital or clinic  we generate sales at the time the product is used in surgery rather than at shipment 
cost of sales 
we manufacture nearly all of the products that we sell 
our cost of sales consists primarily of manufacturing personnel  raw materials and components  depreciation of property and equipment  and other allocated manufacturing overhead  as well as freight expense we pay to ship products to customers 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions  stock based compensation  travel and entertainment  attendance at medical society meetings  training programs  advertising and product promotions  direct mail  and other marketing costs 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of executive  finance and human resource expense  stock based compensation  legal and accounting fees  information technology expense  intangible amortization expense  and insurance expense 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  enhancement  and regulatory approval of our products  principally salaries  laboratory testing  and supply costs 
it also includes costs associated with design and execution of clinical studies  regulatory submissions and costs to register  maintain  and defend our intellectual property  and royalty payments associated with licensed and acquired intellectual property 
restructuring 
restructuring expense includes costs directly associated with distribution agreement termination expenses  severance and retention costs for terminated employees  factory relocation costs  and other expenses associated with restructuring our operations 
other income expense 
other income expense primarily includes interest income and expense  investment impairment charges  foreign currency gains losses  and other miscellaneous gains losses 
income tax expense 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes for earnings generated in the united states  which include operating losses in certain foreign jurisdictions for certain years depending on tax elections made  and foreign taxes on earnings of our wholly owned german  french  italian  spanish  and japanese subsidiaries 
our consolidated tax expense is affected by the mix of our taxable income loss in the united states  germany  france  italy  spain  switzerland  and japan  permanent items  discrete items  unrecognized tax benefits  and amortization of goodwill for u

net sales decreased to million in from million in divestitures  primarily of the taarget and unifit stent graft product lines as well as the termination of the endologix aortic stent graft distribution agreement  resulted in a decrease in sales of from the prior year 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced year over year sales by 
net sales decreases of million in were primarily driven by the divestiture of our stent graft product lines which accounted for million of sales during  a million decrease in polyester graft sales  and a weakening of the euro  which negatively impacted sales by million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher average selling prices across nearly all product lines  increased sales in biologic patches of million  increased sales of radiopaque tape of million and increased sales of catheters of million  which was partially driven by selected pricing discounts in new geographies

biologic patches became available for sale in europe in july in april  the regulatory agencies in the united kingdom and france issued prohibition notices which prohibited us from selling our albograft polyester grafts in those countries until further notice 
in july  the regulatory agencies substantially rescinded the prohibition notices allowing the products to return to market

the gross margin increase was largely the result of a reduction in costs related to the closure of our factory in brindisi  italy in march  a reduction in costs associated with the manufacturing start up and transition activities related to the albograft and lifespan product lines  increased selling prices across most of our product lines  and favorable product and geographic mix driven largely by our exit from stent grafts 
the gross margin increase was partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies as well as increased sales of xenosure 
the gross profit increase was largely the result of the increase in the gross margin  which was partially offset by our exit from the stent graft product lines  which generated million of revenue in in november  we acquired the manufacturing and distribution rights of the xenosure biologic vascular patch  which we expect will negatively affect gross profit in as we transition production to our burlington facility

sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million in compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses were in  up from the prior year 
selling expenses increased million while marketing expenses increased by million 
the increase in selling expenses was primarily driven by increased sales personnel compensation of million and million of additional sales meetings and travel costs 
these increases were partially offset by million of transition services related to the lifespan acquisition and the buy out of our former spanish distributor 
marketing expense increases were largely driven by million of additional advertising costs 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced expenses by million compared to the prior year period 
at december   we employed sales representatives worldwide  compared to in the prior year period 
we plan to increase the size of our sales force in  primarily related to the hiring of additional canadian sales representatives  and we expect that selling and marketing expenses will increase commensurately 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease was largely driven by a decrease in compensation costs of million  the closure of our biomateriali facility in march  which incurred general and administrative costs of million in the prior year period  and by changes in foreign currency exchange rates of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the settlement of an employee matter of million and bad debt expense relating to certain european markets of million 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in both and we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in primarily due to our direct sales efforts in canada 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in from in product development expenses increased million primarily due to increased product engineer compensation and additional testing and sample costs 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased million  primarily due to an increase in compensation expenses 
process engineering expenses decreased million 
royalty expenses decreased million  primarily due to our exit from our stent graft product lines 
we expect research and development costs to increase marginally in as we continue to invest in new product development efforts 
restructuring 
we did not incur restructuring charges in compared to million of restructuring charges in the prior year 
in  we closed our biomateriali manufacturing facility in brindisi  italy and transitioned production to our existing corporate headquarters in burlington  massachusetts 
in  we also closed our lifespan manufacturing facility in laguna hills  california and transitioned production to burlington 
finally  we terminated our spanish and danish distribution agreements and reorganized our european administrative and sales personnel as a result of our exit from the stent graft business in gain on divestitures 
in  we recognized a gain on divestitures of million resulting from payments on a promissory note related to the divestiture of our taarget and unifit stent graft product lines to duke vascular  inc in in july  we terminated our endologix distribution agreement for million and recognized a gain of impairment charges 
we did not incur impairment charges in we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits 

table of contents other income expense 
foreign exchange losses for were million compared to foreign exchange gains for of  foreign exchange gains were due to the comparative strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro during the year 
net interest income and other income expense increased by approximately  primarily due to the interest earned from the promissory note related to our stent graft divestiture in income tax expense

the provision was comprised of federal tax in the united states of million  taxes in certain foreign subsidiaries that are profitable of million and state taxes of million 
our effective tax rate differed from the us statutory tax rate in principally due to permanent items  changes in our valuation allowances  specific manufacturing deductions  state taxes  and release of uncertain tax position reserves 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known contingencies 
we have assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and concluded that as of december   we will continue to carry a valuation allowance against million of deferred tax assets  principally foreign net operating loss carry forwards  which based on the weight of available evidence  we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized

table of contents impairment charges 
we incurred million of impairment charges in related to patents deemed to have no value based on future expected economic benefits 
we incurred million of impairment charges in of which million was due to the write down of certain technology  customer lists  and fixed assets related to our aortic stent graft product line 
additionally  we incurred a million impairment charge associated with a biomateriali private label customer relationship  which we subsequently terminated 
other income expense 
foreign exchange gains for were  compared to foreign exchange losses for of  in foreign exchange gains were due to the comparative weakening of the us dollar versus the euro during the year

liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with maturities of days or less at the date of purchase and consist of money market funds  and are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
we did not hold any marketable securities nor any mortgage asset backed or auction rate securities in our investment portfolio as of december  all of our cash held outside of the united states is available for corporate use 
operating and capital expenditure requirements we require cash to pay our operating expenses  make capital expenditures  fund acquisitions  and pay our long term liabilities 
since our inception  we have funded our operations through private and public placements of equity securities  short term borrowings  and funds generated from our operations 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
for the year ended december   we recognized operating income of million 
we expect to fund any increased costs and expenditures from our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  though our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the revenues generated by sales of our products  payments associated with potential future quarterly cash dividends to our common stockholders  payments associated with our stock repurchase plan  payments associated with u

we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments and the interest we earn on these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond the next twelve months  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or borrow from a financial institution 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  such securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
italian loan and grant as part of the purchase of biomateriali srl  we assumed a loan from the italian government under a program that provided funding to certain businesses in italy through a combination of grants and loans if certain requirements are met 
the loan was stated to be payable in ten annual payments through of principal and interest at an interest rate of 
the present value of the loan was recorded as of the date the proceeds were received using our incremental borrowing rate 
interest was being imputed on the loan and the amortization was recorded as interest expense 
the italian government informed us the loan and grant will become due in full as a result of the biomateriali srl plant closure 
as a result  in december  we incurred approximately million of restructuring charges related to additional interest and penalties charges  and we made the final payment to the italian government of million in december in  we had previously recorded approximately million of restructuring charges related to the expected repayment of the grants  the imputed interest on the outstanding loan balance  and certain additional interest and penalties

the net cash used by changes in working capital was principally the result of a decrease in accounts payables as well as an increase in accounts receivable  inventories and other current assets 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in this was due to the million of acquisition related payments  primarily related to the xenosure biologic patch acquisition  certain distributor buyouts  and the purchase of new property and equipment of million 
these cash uses were partially offset by a million repayment of a promissory note from duke vascular related to our stent graft divestiture in net cash used in investing activities was million in this was due to the purchase of new property and equipment of million  as a result of the transfer of manufacturing from brindisi  italy and laguna hills  california to burlington  massachusetts and million of acquisition related payments  primarily related to the lifespan vascular graft acquisition and the spanish and danish distributor buyouts 
these cash uses were partially offset by a million distribution termination payment from endologix 
financing activities

table of contents contractual obligations 
our principal contractual obligations consist of operating leases and inventory purchase commitments 
the following table summarizes our commitments to settle contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase commitments for inventory total contractual obligations the commitments under our operating leases consist primarily of lease payments for our burlington  massachusetts  corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  expiring in  our toronto  ontario  canada office  expiring in  our sulzbach  germany office  expiring in  our tokyo  japan office  expiring in  our milan  italy office  expiring in  and our madrid  spain office  expiring in they also include automobile and equipment leases 
the purchase commitments for inventory are to be used in operations over the normal course of business and do not represent excess commitments or loss contracts 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are reviewed on an ongoing basis and updated as appropriate 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our more critical accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  and observance of trends in the industry  as appropriate 
different  reasonable estimates could have been used in the current period 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
both of these factors could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates and related accounting policies are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements 
those financial estimates and related policies include revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from the sale of disposable or implantable devices used during vascular surgery 
we sell directly to hospitals and to distributors  as described below  and  during the periods presented in our consolidated financial statements  entered into consigned inventory arrangements with either hospitals or distributors on a limited basis 

table of contents we recognize revenue when four basic criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we generally use customer purchase orders or contracts to determine the existence of an arrangement 
sales transactions are based on prices that are determinable at the time that the customer s purchase order is accepted by us 
in order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we would defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we provide for product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return product history 
based on these policies  we recognize revenue  net of allowances for returns and discounts  as products are shipped  based on shipping point terms  or at the time consigned inventory is consumed at which time title passes to customers 
we recognize revenue net of allowances for returns and discounts  at the time of shipment of our products to our distributors 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable are with customers based in the united states and internationally 
accounts receivable generally are due within to days of invoice and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  other than in certain european markets where longer payment terms are customary and may range from to days 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the current creditworthiness of the customers  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections  and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we identify 
we closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks  including those that may arise from economic conditions  in both the us and international economies 
our european sales to government owned or supported customers such as hospitals  distributors and agents  in southern europe  specifically italy and spain may be subject to significant payment delays due to government austerity measures impacting funding and payment practices 
as of december  our receivables in italy and spain totaled million and million  respectively 
receivables balances with certain publicly owned hospitals and government supported customers in these countries can accumulate over a period of time and then subsequently be settled as large lump sum payments 
while we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts in these countries is adequate as of december   if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of these european governments or if government funding becomes unavailable  we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers and our write offs of uncollectible amounts may increase 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and allowances  we cannot guarantee the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts on a monthly basis and all past due balances are reviewed individually for collectability 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in general and administrative expenses 
inventory inventory consists of finished products  work in process  and raw materials 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead and is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand 
table of contents may not be accurate  and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
stock based compensation we recognize  as expense  the estimated fair value of stock options to employees which is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
we have elected to recognize the compensation cost of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
in periods that we grant stock options  fair value assumptions are based on volatility  interest  dividend yield  and expected term over which the stock options will be outstanding 
the computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury risk free interest rate in effect at the time of grant 
historical data on exercise patterns is the basis for estimating the expected life of an option 
the expected annual dividend rate was calculated by dividing our annual dividend  based on the most recent quarterly dividend rate  by the closing stock price on the grant date 
we also issue restricted stock units rsus as an additional form of equity compensation to our employees  officers  and directors  pursuant to our stockholder approved plan 
rsus entitle the grantee to an issuance of stock at no cost and generally vest over a period of time determined by our board of directors at the time of grant based upon the continued service to the company 
the fair market value of the award is determined based on the number of rsus granted and the market value of our common stock on the grant date and is amortized to expense over the period of vesting 
unvested rsus are forfeited and canceled as of the date that employment or service to the company terminates 
rsus are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting 
we may repurchase common stock upon our employees vesting in rsus in order to cover any minimum tax withholding liability as a result of the rsus having vested 
share based compensation charges are recorded net of the estimated forfeitures based upon historical rates and will be adjusted in future periods to reflect the results of actual forfeitures and vesting 
share based compensation charges are recorded across the consolidated statement of operations based upon the grantee s primary function 
as disclosed more fully in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we recorded expense of approximately million in connection with share based payment awards for the year ended december  the future expense of non vested share based awards of approximately million is to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
during  we granted stock options at a weighted average fair value of and restricted stock units with weighted average fair value of 
valuation of goodwill  and other intangibles goodwill represents the amount of consideration paid in connection with business acquisitions in excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present or changes in circumstances suggest that an impairment may exist 
we evaluate the december balance of the carrying value of goodwill based on a single reporting unit annually 
we perform an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than its carrying value as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
the more likely than not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than percent 
if required  the next step of the goodwill impairment test is to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined on the same basis as the amount of goodwill recognized in connection with a business combination 
specifically  the fair value of a reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination as of the date of the impairment review and as if the fair value 
table of contents of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
goodwill was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our annual impairment testing indicated no significant risk of impairment based upon changes in value that are reasonably likely to occur 
however  changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the estimated fair value of our reporting unit 
other intangible assets consist primarily of purchased developed technology  patents  customer relationships  and trademarks and are amortized over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist for a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment 
conditions that may indicate impairment include  but are not limited to  a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a change in the operating cash flows associated with the asset  or adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
if an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset  we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified 
we generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk adjusted discount rate 
in determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets  we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions  cost structures  and remaining useful lives of the asset 
these estimates and assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were million as of december   and million as of december  we recognized impairment charges on our intangible assets of million in and million in contingencies in the normal course of business  we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  and other claims and assessments for matters related to  among other things  patent infringement  business acquisitions  employment  product liability and product recalls 
we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we record charges for the costs we anticipate incurring in connection with litigation and claims against us when we determine a loss is probable and we can reasonably estimate these costs 
during the years ended december    and  we were not subject to any material litigation  claims or assessments 
restructuring we record restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or distributor terminations 
these restructuring charges  which reflect our commitment to a termination or exit plan that will begin within twelve months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal matters  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from recognition of items for income tax and 
table of contents accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income during the carryback period or in the future  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we do not provide for income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as our current intention is to permanently reinvest these earnings 
we recognize  measure  present and disclose in our financial statements  uncertain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on a tax return 
we operate in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside of the united states and may be subject to audits from various tax authorities regarding transfer pricing  the deductibility of certain expenses  intercompany transactions  and other matters 
within specific countries  we may be subject to audit by various tax authorities operating within the country and may be subject to different statutes of limitation expiration dates 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  liabilities for uncertain tax positions  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended existing rules covering fair value measurement and disclosure to clarify guidance and minimize differences between gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the new guidance requires us to provide information about valuation techniques and unobservable inputs used in level fair value measurements and provide a narrative description of the sensitivity of level measurements to changes in unobservable inputs 
the guidance became effective on january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  new guidance was issued pertaining to the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new rule eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the standard is intended to provide a more consistent method of presenting non owner transactions that affect the company s equity 
under the new guidance  an entity can elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement or in two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the new guidance was effective for fiscal years that begin after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued new guidance which requires disclosure of information about significant reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements 
this guidance will be effective in we believe the adoption of this standard  which is related to disclosure only  will not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  we do not currently have  nor have we ever had  any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market  or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships
