item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the trust was organized as a self advised reit in the state of maryland in june  with a focus on investments primarily in upper upscale hotels in major business and convention markets and  on a selective basis  premium select service hotels in urban settings or unique locations in the us we believe industry dynamics since our inception have created and will continue to create attractive opportunities to acquire high quality hotels  at prices below replacement costs  with attractive yields on investment and upside potential 
we completed our ipo in january and have since acquired or committed to acquire the following hotels hotel location rooms acquisition date hyatt regency boston boston  ma march  hilton checkers los angeles los angeles  ca june  courtyard anaheim at disneyland resort anaheim  ca july  boston marriott newton newton  ma july  le meridien san francisco san francisco  ca december  homewood suites seattle convention center seattle  wa may  w chicago city center chicago  il may  hotel indigo san diego gaslamp quarter san diego  ca june  courtyard washington capitol hill navy yard washington  dc june  hotel adagio san francisco san francisco  ca july  denver marriott city center denver  co october  holiday inn new york city midtown st street new york  ny december  w chicago lakeshore chicago  il august  hyatt regency mission bay spa and marina san diego  ca september  the hotel minneapolis  autograph collection minneapolis  mn october  hyatt place new york midtown south new york  ny under contract hotel operating metrics we believe that the results of operations of our hotels are best explained by three key performance indicators occupancy  adr and revpar  which is room revenue divided by total number of available rooms 
revpar does not include food and beverage revenues or other ancillary revenues  such as parking  telephone or other guest services provided by the hotel 
occupancy is a major driver of room revenue  as well as other revenue categories  such as food and beverage and parking 
adr helps to drive room revenue as well  however  it does not have a direct effect on other revenue categories 
fluctuations in occupancy are accompanied by fluctuations in most categories of variable operating costs  such as utility costs and certain labor costs such as housekeeping  resulting in varying levels of hotel profitability 
increases in adr typically result in higher hotel profitability since variable hotel expenses generally do not increase correspondingly 
thus  increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs  while increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr are accompanied by increases in limited categories of operating costs  such as management fees and franchise fees 
executive summary our hotel portfolio continued its strong performance during as the us lodging industry experienced improving fundamentals for the third consecutive year since the economic recession of we remained active in growing our hotel portfolio in by acquiring or committing to acquire four high quality hotels located in major markets with high barriers to entry for an aggregate purchase price of million 
we funded these acquisitions by raising approximately million of net proceeds from preferred and common share offerings during the year 
in addition  we were able to take advantage of the attractive interest rate environment and extend debt maturities by closing on million of new secured financings and amending our revolving credit facility 
our hotel portfolio significantly outperformed the overall us lodging industry in revpar in we believe our outperformance was a result of our intense asset management and because our hotels are located in major markets  and specifically  in several of the strongest performing markets in the us  including boston  san francisco  los angeles  and san 
table of contents diego 
occupancy at our hotels is primarily driven by business transient customers  from which segment we continue to see strong demand for rooms 
because occupancy at our hotels were at high levels during the year  our hotel operators were able to exercise pricing power and aggressively increase adr  and as a result  also significantly increase hotel profitability 
during the year  we completed the renovation and repositioning of the hotel adagio san francisco  the addition of rooms to the top two vacant floors of the w chicago city center  and certain capital projects at the hyatt regency boston and the hotel indigo san diego gaslamp quarter 
we are in the process of completing  or planning to complete in the future  certain capital projects at various other hotels  including a comprehensive renovation of the w chicago lakeshore expected to commence in the fourth quarter we will continue to evaluate and invest in select return on investment projects 
we expect positive operating trends for our hotel portfolio to continue through the remainder of and for several years thereafter as a result of favorable hotel supply and demand fundamentals in our geographic markets and the completion of our return on investment projects 
subsequent to december   we were able to raise an additional million of net proceeds from a common share offering 
we also took further advantage of the attractive interest rate environment and extend debt maturities by closing on a million secured financing 
with global economic concerns and volatility slowly dissipating  and the us presidential election process now completed  we are beginning to see  in early  an increase in discussions surrounding hotel transactions 
we expect hotel transaction activity to increase in as compared to and we expect to use these additional funds to continue pursuing compelling opportunities to make acquisitions and prudently grow our hotel portfolio

table of contents non gaap financial measures non gaap financial measures are measures of our historical financial performance that are different from measures calculated and presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we report the following four non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance funds from operations ffo  adjusted ffo affo  corporate ebitda  and adjusted corporate ebitda 
ffo we calculate ffo in accordance with standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  which defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap  excluding depreciation and amortization  impairment charges  gains losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
by excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization and gains losses from sales of real estate  both of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that ffo provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our operating performance 
affo we further adjust ffo for certain additional recurring and non recurring items that are not in nareit s definition of ffo 
specifically  we adjust for hotel acquisition costs and non cash amortization of intangible assets and unfavorable contract liabilities 
we believe that affo provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that provides for greater comparability of our core operating results between periods 
the following table reconciles net income available to common shareholders  excluding amounts attributable to unvested time based awards to ffo and affo available to common shareholders for the years ended december   and in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net income loss available to common shareholders  excluding amounts attributable to unvested time based awards add depreciation and amortization ffo available to common shareholders add hotel acquisition costs non cash amortization affo available to common shareholders ffo available per common share basic and diluted affo available per common share basic and diluted includes non cash amortization of ground lease asset  deferred franchise costs  unfavorable contract liability  and air rights contract 
corporate ebitda corporate ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe that corporate ebitda provides investors a useful financial measure to evaluate our operating performance  excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization 
adjusted corporate ebitda we further adjust corporate ebitda for certain additional recurring and non recurring items 
specifically  we adjust for hotel property acquisition costs and non cash amortization of intangible assets 
we believe that adjusted corporate ebitda provides investors with another financial measure of our operating performance that is more comparable between periods 

table of contents the following table reconciles net income to corporate ebitda and adjusted corporate ebitda for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  net income loss add depreciation and amortization interest expense loss on early extinguishment of debt income tax expense benefit less interest income corporate ebitda add hotel acquisition costs non cash amortization adjusted corporate ebitda includes non cash amortization of ground lease asset  deferred franchise costs  unfavorable contract liability  and air rights contract 
none of ffo  affo  corporate ebitda  or adjusted corporate ebitda represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap  nor shall any of these measures be considered as an alternative to gaap net income loss  as an indication of our financial performance  or to gaap cash flow from operating activities  as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo  affo  corporate ebitda  and adjusted corporate ebitda are not indicative of funds available to fund cash needs  including the ability to make cash distributions 
sources and uses of cash for the year ended december   net cash flows from operating activities were million  net cash flows used in investing activities were million  including million for the acquisitions of the w chicago lakeshore  the hyatt regency mission bay spa and marina  and the hotel minneapolis  autograph collection  million for improvements and additions to our hotels  and million for investment in a hotel construction loan  and net cash flows provided by financing activities were million  including million from the sale of common and preferred shares  offset by million in dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders  million in payment of deferred financing costs  and million in scheduled principal payments on mortgage debt 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources we expect our primary source of cash to meet operating requirements  including payment of dividends in accordance with the reit requirements of the us federal income tax laws  payment of interest on any borrowings and funding of any capital expenditures  will be from our hotels results of operations and existing cash and cash equivalent balances 
we currently expect that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations 
we intend to incur indebtedness to supplement our investment capital and to maintain flexibility to respond to industry conditions and opportunities 
we are targeting an overall debt level of approximately of the aggregate purchase prices of all of our portfolio hotels 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as new hotel acquisitions and scheduled debt maturities  through additional secured and unsecured borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities depends on  among other things  general market conditions for hotel companies and reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze alternate sources of capital in an effort to minimize our capital costs and maximize our financial flexibility 
we expect to continue declaring distributions to shareholders  as required to maintain our reit status  although no assurances can be made that we will continue to generate sufficient income to distribute similar aggregate amounts in the future 
the per share amounts of future distributions will depend on the number of our common and preferred shares outstanding from time to time and will be determined by our board of trustees following its periodic review of our financial performance and capital requirements  and the terms of our existing borrowing arrangements 
on october   we amended our credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement increased the maximum amount we may borrow under our secured revolving credit facility from million to million  and also provides for the 
table of contents possibility of further future increases  up to a maximum of million  in accordance with the terms of our amended credit agreement 
the actual amount that we can borrow under our secured revolving credit facility continues to be based on the value of our hotels included in the borrowing base  as defined in our amended credit agreement 
the interest rate spread over libor for borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility was reduced by basis points to libor  plus the spread over libor based on the our consolidated leverage ratio 
the initial term of our amended credit agreement will now expire in april  but the term may be extended for one year subject to satisfaction of certain customary conditions 
our amended credit agreement effected no other significant changes to the financial covenants  including the leverage and coverage ratios and minimum tangible net worth requirement  or other business terms of our secured revolving credit facility  as compared to those in effect prior to the amendment 
on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of  common shares at a price of per share  including  shares sold pursuant to the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional common shares 
after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering costs  we generated net proceeds of approximately million 
on february   we entered into a loan agreement to obtain a million loan  which matures in february and is secured by the hilton checkers los angeles 
the loan carries a fixed interest rate of per annum  with principal and interest payments based on a year amortization 
as of the date of this filing  we have approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  total borrowing availability of million under our revolving credit facility  of which we have no amounts currently outstanding  and expected proceeds of million under our million term loan subject to satisfaction of certain customary closing conditions and closing of our acquisition of the hyatt place new york midtown south 
in addition  we currently have one unencumbered hotel 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and other long term debt 
we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the hyatt place new york midtown south for a purchase price of million 
giving effect to our pending acquisition of the hyatt place new york midtown south and based on our targeted overall debt level  we have approximately million of remaining investment capacity to continue to grow our hotel portfolio 
capital expenditures we maintain each hotel in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations and in accordance with the franchisor s standards and the agreed upon requirements in our management and loan agreements 
the cost of all such routine improvements and alterations will be paid out of property improvement reserves  which will be funded by a portion of each hotel s gross revenues 
routine capital expenditures will be administered by the management companies 
however  we will have approval rights over the capital expenditures as part of the annual budget process 
from time to time  certain of our hotels may be undergoing renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotels  such as guestrooms  meeting space  and or restaurants  in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets 
in addition  often after we acquire a hotel  we are required to complete a property improvement plan pip in order to bring the hotel up to the respective franchisor s standards 
if permitted by the terms of the management agreement  funding for a renovation will first come from the ff e reserve 
to the extent that the ff e reserve is not adequate to cover the cost of the renovation  we will fund the remaining portion of the renovation with cash and cash equivalents on hand or available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands 
there were no other material off balance sheet arrangements at december   except for the pending acquisition of the hyatt place new york midtown south for a purchase price of million 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years revolving credit facility  including interest term loans  including interest other mortgage loans  including interest corporate office lease ground leases 
table of contents assumes no additional borrowings  and interest payments are based on the interest rate in effect as of december  also assumes that no extension options are exercised 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility and term loans 
the ground lease for the hyatt regency mission bay spa and marina provides for the greater of base or percentage rent  both subject to potential increases over the term of the lease 
amounts assume only base rent for all periods presented and do not assume any adjustments for potential increases 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns 
for non resort properties  demand is generally lower in the winter months due to decreased travel and higher in the spring and summer months during the peak travel season 
for resort properties  demand is generally higher in the winter months 
we expect that our operations will generally reflect non resort seasonality patterns 
accordingly  we expect that we will have lower revenue  operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters and higher revenue  operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters 
these general trends are  however  expected to be greatly influenced by overall economic cycles 
critical accounting policies we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments in hotels we allocate the purchase prices of hotels acquired based on the fair value of the acquired property  ff e  and identifiable intangible assets and the fair value of the liabilities assumed 
in making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating the purchase price  we utilize a number of sources of information that are obtained in connection with the acquisition of a hotel  including valuations performed by independent third parties and cost segregation studies 
we also consider information obtained about each hotel as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
hotel acquisition costs  such as transfer taxes  title insurance  environmental and property condition reviews  and legal and accounting fees  are expensed in the period incurred 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally to years for buildings and building improvements and three to ten years for ff e 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the useful lives of the related assets 
replacements and improvements at the hotels are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
upon the sale or retirement of a property and equipment  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
intangible assets and liabilities are recorded on non market contracts  including air rights and lease  management and franchise agreements  assumed as part of the acquisition of certain hotels 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts assumed and our estimate of the market rates for corresponding contracts measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contracts assumed 
no value is allocated to market contracts 
intangible assets and liabilities are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related contracts 
we review our hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our hotels due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss is recognized 
share based compensation from time to time  we grant restricted share awards to employees and trustees 
to date  we have granted two types of restricted share awards time based awards and performance based awards 
we measure share based compensation expense for the restricted share awards based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant 
the fair value of time based awards is determined based on the closing trading price of our common shares on the measurement date  which is generally the date of grant 
the fair value of performance based awards is determined using a 
table of contents monte carlo simulation 
a monte carlo simulation requires the use of a number of assumptions  including historical volatility and correlation of the price of our common shares and the price of the common shares of our peer group  a risk free rate of return  and an expected term 
for time based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the entire award 
for performance based awards  share based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each award 
for both time based awards and performance based awards  once the total amount of share based compensation expense is determined on the date of the grant  no adjustments are made to the amount recognized each period 
no share based compensation expense is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
revenue recognition hotel revenues  including room  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance that amended the accounting standard on fair value measurements 
the updated accounting guidance provided for a consistent definition and measurement of fair value  as well as similar disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
the updated accounting guidance changed certain fair value measurement principles  clarified the application of existing fair value measurement  and expanded the fair value measurement disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
the updated accounting guidance was to be applied prospectively and was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the new accounting guidance on january  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance has a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued updated accounting guidance which required the presentation of components of other comprehensive income with the components of net income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income that contains two sections  net income and other comprehensive income  or two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated accounting guidance eliminated the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of shareholders equity  and was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we adopted the updated accounting guidance on january  we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance has a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we earn interest income primarily from cash and cash equivalent balances 
based on our cash and cash equivalents as of december   if interest rates increase or decrease by  our interest income will increase or decrease by approximately million annually 
amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus the spread over libor based on our consolidated leverage ratio 
if prevailing libor on any outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were to increase or decrease by  the increase or decrease in interest expense on our debt would increase or decrease future earnings by approximately million annually  assuming that the amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility were to remain at million  the balance at december
