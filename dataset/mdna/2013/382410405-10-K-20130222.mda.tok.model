pv represents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved oil and natural gas reserves before income tax  discounted at 
pv of our total year end proved reserves is considered a non gaap financial measure as defined by the sec 
we believe that the presentation of the pv is relevant and useful to our investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves before taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure 
we further believe investors and creditors use our pv as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies 
our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows of proved reserves  or standardized measure  as of december  was million

table of contents ngl reserves for include our eagle ford shale trend  west brachfield  minden and beckville fields but not south henderson as it was sold in september our production and sales volumes are accounted for and disclosed based on the wet gas stream at the point of sale 
we report no ngl production  as ngls are processed after the point of sale 
however  we share and receive the pricing benefit of the revenue stream of the gas through the processing 
we believe that presenting ngls separately from natural gas and oil in our reserve report provides more information for our investors 
the presentation of ngls as a separate commodity more accurately presents to investors our economic interest in those ngls separated  produced and sold from the wet gas streams which we realize through our sharing in the revenue stream attributable to the processed ngls 
these commodities have separate pricing that is monitored in the marketplace 
the following table presents our reserves by targeted geologic formation in mmcfe 
december  area proved developed proved undeveloped proved reserves of total haynesville shale trend cotton valley taylor sand trend eagle ford shale trend tuscaloosa marine shale trend other total reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil  condensate and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  production and operating costs  the amount and timing of future development expenditures and future oil and natural gas sales prices may differ from those assumed in these estimates 
therefore  the pv amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of the oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
in accordance with the guidelines of the sec  our independent reserve engineers estimates of future net revenues from our estimated proved reserves  and the pv and standardized measure thereof  were determined to be economically producible under existing economic conditions  which requires the use of the month average price for each product  calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for the period of january through december  except where such guidelines permit alternate treatment  including the use of fixed and determinable contractual price escalations 
for reserves at december   the average twelve month prices used were per mmbtu of natural gas and per bbl of crude oil condensate 
these prices do not include the impact of hedging transactions  nor do they include the adjustments that are made for applicable transportation and quality differentials  and price differentials between natural gas liquids and oil  which are deducted from or added to the index prices on a well by well basis in estimating our proved reserves and related future net revenues 
our proved reserve information as of december  included in this annual report on form k was estimated by our independent petroleum consultant  nsai  in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation principles and definitions and guidelines set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and natural gas reserve information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 
the technical persons responsible for preparing the reserves estimates presented herein meet the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and natural gas reserves information promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers 

table of contents our principal engineer has over years of experience in the oil and natural gas industry  including over years as a reserve evaluator  trainer or manager 
further professional qualifications of our principal engineer include a degree in petroleum engineering  extensive internal and external reserve training  and experience in asset evaluation and management 
in addition  the principal engineer is an active participant in professional industry groups and has been a member of the society of petroleum engineers for over years 
our estimates of proved reserves are made by nsai  as our independent petroleum engineers 
our internal professional staff works closely with our external engineers to ensure the integrity  accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process 
in addition  other pertinent data such as seismic information  geologic maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  well performance data  operating procedures and relevant economic criteria is provided to them 
we make available all information requested  including our pertinent personnel  to the external engineers as part of their evaluation of our reserves 
we consider providing independent fully engineered third party estimate of reserves from a nationally reputable petroleum engineering firm  such as nsai  to be the best control in ensuring compliance with rule of regulation s x for reserve estimates 
while we have no formal committee specifically designated to review reserves reporting and the reserves estimation process  a preliminary copy of the nsai reserve report is reviewed by our senior management with representatives of nsai and our internal technical staff 
additionally  our senior management reviews and approves any internally estimated significant changes to our proved reserves semi annually 
proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas  which  by analysis of geosciences and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and or natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
to achieve reasonable certainty  nsai employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 
the technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our proved reserves include  but are not limited to  well logs  geologic maps  available downhole and production data  seismic data and well test data 
our total proved reserves at december   as estimated by nsai  were bcfe  consisting of bcf of natural gas  mmbbls of ngls and mmbbls of oil and condensate 
in we added approximately bcfe related to the haynesville shale trend and cotton valley taylor sand trend  bcfe related to the eagle ford shale trend and bcfe in other areas 
we had negative revisions of approximately bcfe  sale of minerals of bcfe and produced bcfe in the vast majority of our negative revisions related to the loss of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves reflecting low natural gas prices for the year ended december  at an average henry hub spot price of per mmbtu 
our proved undeveloped reserves at december  were bcfe or of our total proved reserves  consisting of bcf of natural gas  mmbbls of ngls and mmbbls of oil and condensate 
in we added approximately bcfe related to the eagle ford shale trend and bcfe related to the tuscaloosa marine shale trend 
we had negative revisions of bcfe and we developed approximately bcfe  or of our total proved undeveloped reserves booked as of december  through the drilling of gross net development wells at an aggregate capital cost of approximately million 
of the proved undeveloped reserves in our december  reserve report  none have remained undeveloped for more than five years since the date of initial booking as proved undeveloped reserves and none are scheduled for commencement of development on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped 

table of contents productive wells the following table sets forth the number of productive wells in which we maintain ownership interests as of december  oil natural gas total gross net gross net gross net south texas east texas northwest louisiana other total productive wells royalty and overriding interest wells that have immaterial values are excluded from the above table 
as of december   only three wells with royalty only and overriding interests only are included 
net working interest 
productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production  including natural gas wells awaiting pipeline connections 
a gross well is a well in which we maintain an ownership interest  while a net well is deemed to exist when the sum of the fractional working interests owned by us equals one 
wells that are completed in more than one producing horizon are counted as one well 
of the gross wells reported above  wells had completions in multiple producing horizons 
acreage the following table summarizes our gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage under lease as of december  acreage in which our interest is limited to a royalty or overriding royalty interest is excluded from the table 
developed undeveloped total gross net gross net gross net south texas east texas northwest louisiana southeast louisiana southwest mississippi other total undeveloped acreage is considered to be those lease acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to the extent that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil  regardless of whether or not such acreage contains proved reserves 
as is customary in the oil and natural gas industry  we can retain our interest in undeveloped acreage by drilling activity that establishes commercial production sufficient to maintain the leases or by payment of delay rentals during the remaining primary term of such a lease 
the oil and natural gas leases in which we have an interest are for varying primary terms  however  most of our developed lease acreage is beyond the primary term and is held so long as natural gas or oil is produced 
lease expirations our undeveloped lease acreage  excluding optioned acreage  will expire during the next four years  unless the leases are converted into producing units or extended prior to lease expiration

table of contents for a discussion of comparative changes in our sales volumes  revenues and operating expenses for the three years ended december   see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations 
oil and natural gas marketing and major customers marketing 
our natural gas production is sold under spot or market sensitive contracts to various natural gas purchasers on short term contracts 
our oil production is sold to various purchasers under short term rollover agreements based on current market prices 
customers 
due to the nature of the industry  we sell our oil and natural gas production to a limited number of purchasers and  accordingly  amounts receivable from such purchasers could be significant 
revenues from the largest of these sources as a percent of oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended december  were as follows bp energy company flint hill resources  llc ogo marketing llc competition the oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive 
major and independent oil and natural gas companies  drilling and production acquisition programs and individual producers and operators are active bidders for desirable oil and natural gas properties  as well as the equipment and labor required to operate those properties 
many competitors have financial resources substantially greater than ours  and staffs and facilities substantially larger than us 
employees at february   we had full time employees in our two administrative offices and two field offices  none of whom is represented by any labor union 
we regularly use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services  particularly in the areas of construction  design  well site supervision  permitting and environmental assessment 
independent contractors usually perform field and on site production operation services for us  including gauging  maintenance  dispatching  inspection  and well testing 
regulations the availability of a ready market for any oil and natural gas production depends upon numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include regulation of oil and natural gas production  federal and state regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control  state limits on allowable rates of production by a well or proration unit  the amount of oil and natural gas available for sale  the availability of adequate pipeline and other transportation and processing facilities and the marketing of competitive fuels 
for example  a productive natural gas well may be shut in because of an oversupply of natural gas or the lack of an available natural gas pipeline in the areas in which we may conduct operations 
state and federal regulations generally are intended to prevent waste of oil and natural gas  protect rights to produce oil and natural gas between owners in a common reservoir  control the amount of oil and natural gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production and control contamination of the environment 
pipelines are subject to the jurisdiction of various federal  state and local agencies as well 

table of contents environmental and occupational health and safety matters general our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  regional  state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety  the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits before drilling or other related activity commences  restrict the type  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling and production activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  impose specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution arising from drilling and production operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctions that may limit or prohibit some or all of our operations 
these laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible 
the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability 
additionally  the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment  and  any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly well construction  drilling  waste management or completion activities or waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal and state environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition  there is no assurance that we will be able to remain in compliance in the future with such existing or any new laws and regulations or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
the following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental laws to which our business operations are subject and with which compliance may have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
hazardous substances and wastes the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended cercla  also known as the superfund law  and analogous state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred  and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances released at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several  strict liabilities for remediation costs at the site  natural resource damages and for the costs of certain health studies 
additionally  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file tort claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances released into the environment 
we generate materials in the course of our operations that are regulated as hazardous substances 
we also may incur liability under the resource conservation and recovery act  as amended rcra  and comparable state statutes that impose stringent requirements related to the handling and disposal of non hazardous and hazardous solid wastes 
while there exists an exclusion under rcra from the definition of hazardous wastes for drilling fluids  produced waters and certain other wastes generated in the exploration  development or production of oil and natural gas  efforts have been made from time to time to remove this exclusion such that those wastes would be regulated as hazardous wastes and therefore subject to more rigorous rcra standards 
notwithstanding the continued effectiveness of this rcra exclusion  these exploration  development and production wastes remain subject to regulation by the epa and state environmental agencies as non hazardous solid wastes 

table of contents we currently own or lease  and in the past have owned or leased  properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration and production for many years 
although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time  hazardous substances  wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us  or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for recycling or disposal 
in addition  some of our properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances  wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons were not under our control 
these properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under such laws  we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes  remediate contaminated property  or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination 
water discharges and subsurface injections the federal water pollution control act  as amended  clean water act  and analogous state laws  impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including spills and leaks of oil and other substances  into state and federal waters 
the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited  except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by epa or an analogous state agency 
spill prevention  control and countermeasure spcc plan requirements imposed under the clean water act require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill  rupture or leak 
in addition  the clean water act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities 
the clean water act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters  including wetlands  unless authorized by permit 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the clean water act and analogous state laws and regulations 
in addition  the oil pollution act of  as amended opa  imposes a variety of requirements related to the prevention of oil spills into navigable waters 
the disposal of oil and natural gas wastes into underground injection wells are subject to the federal safe drinking water act  as amended sdwa  and analogous state laws 
under part c of the sdwa  the epa established the underground injection control program  which establishes requirements for permitting  testing  monitoring  recordkeeping and reporting of injection well activities as well as a prohibition against the migration of fluid containing any contaminants into underground sources of drinking water 
state programs may have analogous permitting and operational requirements 
any leakage from the subsurface portions of the injection wells may cause degradation of freshwater  potentially resulting in cancellation of operations of a well  issuance of fines and penalties from governmental agencies  incurrence of expenditures for remediation of the affected resource  and imposition of liability by third parties for property damages and personal injury 
hydraulic fracturing hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and or oil from dense subsurface rock formations 
the hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water  sand  and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in our drilling and completion programs 
hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions  but the epa has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published draft permitting guidance in may addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels 
in november  the epa announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the agency currently plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to 
table of contents require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  some states  including louisiana and texas  where we operate  have adopted  and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
local government also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time  place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular 
we believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities 
nevertheless  if new or more stringent federal  state  or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities  and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 
in addition  certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with a first progress report outlining work currently underway by the agency released on december  and a final report drawing conclusions about the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources expected to be available for public comment and peer review by moreover  the epa has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms 
air emissions the federal clean air act  as amended caa  and comparable state laws  regulate emissions of various air pollutants from many sources in the united states  including crude oil and natural gas production activities through air emissions standards  construction and operating programs and the imposition of other compliance regulations 
these laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions  obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements  or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants 
federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative  civil and criminal penalties for non compliance with air permits or other requirements of the clean air act and associated state laws and regulations 
over the next several years  we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues 
for example  on august   the epa published final rules under the caa that subject oil and natural gas production  processing  transmission and storage operations to regulation under the new source performance standards nsps and national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap programs 
with regards to production activities  these final rules require  among other things  the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from three subcategories of fractured and refractured gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted wildcat exploratory and delineation gas wells  low reservoir pressure non wildcat and non delineation gas wells  and all other fractured and refractured gas wells 
all three subcategories of wells must route flow back emissions to a gathering line or be captured and combusted using a combustion device such as a flare after october  however  the other wells must use reduced emission completions  also known as green completions  with or without combustion devices  after january  these regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production related wet seal and reciprocating compressors  effective october  and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels  effective october  compliance with these requirements could increase our costs of development and production  which costs could be significant 
table of contents climate change based on findings by the epa in december that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane  and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are contributing to the warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes  the epa has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the caa 
the epa has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states on an annual basis  including  among others  certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities  which include certain of our operations 
we are monitoring ghg emissions from our operations in accordance with the ghg emissions reporting rule and believe that our monitoring activities are in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations 
while congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs that require reporting of ghgs or otherwise limit emissions of ghgs from our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to monitor and report on ghg emissions or reduce emissions of ghgs associated with our operations or could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of ghgs in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production interests and operations 
endangered species the federal endangered species act  as amended esa  and analogous state laws restrict activities that could have an adverse effect on threatened or endangered species or their habitats 
some of our operations may be located in or near areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species 
in these areas  we may be obligated to develop and implement plans to avoid potential adverse impacts to protected species  and we may be prohibited from conducting operations in certain locations or during certain seasons  such as breeding and nesting seasons  when our operations could have an adverse effect on the species 
it is also possible that a federal or state agency could order a complete halt to our activities in certain locations if it is determined that such activities may have a serious adverse effect on a protected species 
moreover  as a result of a settlement approved by the us district court for the district of columbia in september  the us fish and wildlife service is required to make a determination on listing more than species as endangered or threatened under the esa before the completion of the agency s fiscal year 
the presence of protected species or the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could impair our ability to timely complete well drilling and development and could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas 
employee health and safety we are also subject to the requirements of the federal occupational safety and health act  as amended  osha  and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard  the emergency planning and community right to know act  as amended  and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governmental authorities and citizens 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws relating to worker health and safety 
other laws and regulations state statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
in addition  there are state statutes  rules and regulations governing conservation matters  including the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the spacing  plugging and abandonment of such wells 
such statutes and regulations may limit the rate at which oil and natural gas could otherwise be produced from our properties and may restrict the number of wells that may be drilled on a particular lease or in a particular field

for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of the company has based these forward looking statements on its current expectations and assumptions about future events 
these statements are based on certain assumptions and analyses made by the company in light of its experience and its perception of historical trends  current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
these forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this report  or if earlier  as of the date they were made  the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
these forward looking statements involve risk and uncertainties 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations include  but are not limited to  the following risk and uncertainties planned capital expenditures  future drilling activity  our financial condition  business strategy including the our ability to successfully transition to more liquids focused operations  the market prices of oil and natural gas  uncertainties about the estimated quantities of oil and natural gas reserves  financial market conditions and availability of capital  production  hedging arrangements  future cash flows and borrowings  litigation matters  pursuit of potential future acquisition opportunities  sources of funding for exploration and development  general economic conditions  either nationally or in the jurisdictions in which we are doing business  legislative or regulatory changes  including retroactive royalty or production tax regimes  hydraulic fracturing regulation  drilling and permitting regulations  derivatives reform  changes in state and federal corporate taxes  environmental regulation  environmental risks and liability under federal  state and foreign and local environmental laws and regulations  
table of contents the creditworthiness of our financial counterparties and operation partners  the securities  capital or credit markets  our ability to repay our debt  and other factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our other public filings  press releases and discussions with our management 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures related to our reserves are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve report 
these differences may be material 
the proved oil and natural gas reserve information included in this report are estimates 
these estimates are based on reports prepared by nsai  our independent reserve engineers  and were calculated using the unweighted average of first day of the month oil and natural gas prices in these prices will change and may be lower at the time of production than those prices that prevailed during reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and of future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  including historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing wells  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies  assumptions concerning future oil and natural gas prices  and assumptions concerning future operating costs  severance and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs 
because all reserve estimates are to some degree subjective  each of the following items may differ materially from those assumed in estimating proved reserves the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered  the production and operating costs incurred  the amount and timing of future development expenditures  and future oil and natural gas sales prices 
furthermore  different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same available data 
our actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely be different from estimates and the differences may be material 
the discounted future net cash flows included in this document should not be considered as the current market value of the estimated oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
as required by the sec  the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on month average prices and costs as of the date of the estimate  while actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows also will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual production  supply and demand for oil and natural gas  increases or decreases in consumption  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used to calculate discounted future net cash flows for reporting purposes  and which we use in calculating our pv  is not necessarily the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 

table of contents our operations are subject to governmental risks that may impact our operations 
our operations have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and are subject to complex federal  state  tribal  local and other laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  permitting and changes in taxes  deductions  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies or price gathering rate controls 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  tribal and local governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws  including tax laws  and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
our operations are subject to environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that may expose us to significant costs and liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  regional  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  health and safety aspects of our operations  or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including the acquisition of permits  including drilling permits  before conducting regulated activities  the restriction of types  quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  the application of specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection  and the imposition of substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions  including administrative  civil or criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations  and the issuance of orders limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations 
there is inherent risk of incurring significant environmental costs and liabilities in the performance of our operations as a result of our handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes  because of air emissions and wastewater discharges related to our operations  and as a result of historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
under certain environmental laws and regulations  we could be subject to strict  joint and several liabilities for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination 
private parties  including the owners of properties upon which our wells are drilled and facilities where our petroleum hydrocarbons or wastes are taken for reclamation or disposal  also may have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property or natural resource damages 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly well drilling  construction  completion or water management activities  or waste control  handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our own results of operations  competitive position or financial condition 
we may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance 
federal  state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing as well as government reviews of such activity could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect our production 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
we routinely use hydraulic fracturing techniques in many of our drilling and completion programs 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions  but due to public concerns raised regarding potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on groundwater quality  the epa has 
table of contents asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the sdwa over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  some states  including louisiana and texas  where we operate  have adopted  and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
in the event that new or more stringent federal  state  or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate  we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements  experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration  development  or production activities  and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells 
in addition  certain governmental reviews have been conducted or are underway that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater and epa expects to issue a final report by moreover  the epa has announced that it will develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms 
our future revenues are dependent on the ability to successfully complete drilling activity 
drilling and exploration are the main methods we utilize to replace our reserves 
however  drilling and exploration operations may not result in any increases in reserves for various reasons 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the future cost and timing of drilling  completing and producing wells is often uncertain 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including lack of acceptable prospective acreage  inadequate capital resources  unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment or labor  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  limitations in the market for oil and natural gas  title problems  compliance with governmental regulations  mechanical difficulties  and risks associated with horizontal drilling 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop and exploit prospects or properties depend in part on data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often uncertain 

table of contents in addition  while lower oil and natural gas prices may reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically  higher oil and natural gas prices generally increase the demand for drilling rigs  equipment and crews and can lead to shortages of  and increased costs for  such drilling equipment  services and personnel 
such shortages could restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling of new wells or significant increase in drilling costs could adversely affect our ability to increase our reserves and production and reduce our revenues 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile  a sustained decrease in the price of oil or natural gas would adversely impact our business 
our success will depend on the market prices of oil and natural gas 
these market prices tend to fluctuate significantly in response to factors beyond our control 
the prices we receive for our crude oil production are based on global market conditions 
the general pace of global economic growth  the continued instability in the middle east and other oil and natural gas producing regions and actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its maintenance of production constraints  as well as other economic  political  and environmental factors will continue to affect world supply and prices 
domestic natural gas prices fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors including us economic conditions  weather patterns  other factors affecting demand such as substitute fuels  the impact of drilling levels on crude oil and natural gas supply  and the environmental and access issues that limit future drilling activities for the industry 
natural gas and crude oil prices are extremely volatile 
average oil and natural gas prices varied substantially during the past few years 
any actual or anticipated reduction in natural gas and crude oil and prices may further depress the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
we expect that commodity prices will continue to fluctuate significantly in the future 
changes in commodity prices significantly affect our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
realized prices for natural gas decreased slightly in and are lower when compared with average prices in prior years 
these lower prices  coupled with the slow recovery in financial markets that has significantly limited and increased the cost of capital  have compelled most oil and natural gas producers  including us  to reduce the level of exploration  drilling and production activity 
this will have a significant effect on our capital resources  liquidity and expected operating results 
any sustained reductions in oil and natural gas prices will directly affect our revenues and can indirectly impact expected production by changing the amount of funds available to us to reinvest in exploration and development activities 
further reductions in oil and natural gas prices could also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable 
a reduction in our reserves could have other adverse consequences including a possible downward redetermination of the availability of borrowings under our senior credit facility  which would restrict our liquidity 
additionally  further or continued declines in prices could result in non cash charges to earnings due to impairment write downs 
any such writedown could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
we have limited experience drilling wells on our tuscaloosa marine shale trend acreage  which has a limited operational history and is subject to more uncertainties than our drilling program in more established formations 
we  along with other operators  have begun drilling wells in the tuscaloosa marine shale trend only recently 
accordingly  we have limited information on which we can determine optimum drilling and completion strategies  or estimate production decline rates or recoverable reserves from drilling on our acreage in this trend 
our drilling plans with respect to the tuscaloosa marine shale trend are flexible and depend on a number of factors  including the extent to which our initial wells in the trend are commercially successful 
the enactment of derivatives legislation could have an adverse effect on our ability to use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of commodity price  interest rate  and other risks associated with our business 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act enacted in  establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over the counter derivatives market and entities  such as us  
table of contents that participate in that market 
the dodd frank act requires the commodities futures trading commission cftc and the sec to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the dodd frank act 
in its rulemaking under the dodd frank act  the cftc issued a final rule on position limits for certain futures and option contracts in the major energy markets and for swaps that are their economic equivalents 
certain bona fide hedging transactions or positions are exempt from these position limits 
the position limits rule was vacated by the us district court for the district of colombia in september and the cftc recently stated that it will appeal the district court s decision 
the cftc also finalized other regulations  including critical rulemakings on the definition of swap  swap dealer  and major swap participant 
some regulations  however  remain to be finalized and it is not possible at this time to predict when this will be accomplished 
depending on our classification and the particular nature of our derivative activities  the dodd frank act and regulations may require us to comply with margin requirements and with certain clearing and trade execution requirements in connection with certain derivative activities 
the dodd frank act and regulations may also require the counterparties to our derivative instruments to spin off some of their derivatives activities to separate entities  which may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparties 
the dodd frank act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of derivative contracts including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity  materially alter the terms of derivative contracts  reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter  reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivative contracts  and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties 
if we reduce our use of derivatives as a result of the dodd frank act and regulations  our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable  which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures 
increased volatility may make us less attractive to certain types of investors 
finally  the dodd frank act was intended  in part  to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity instruments related to oil and natural gas 
our revenues could therefore be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation and regulations is to lower commodity prices 
any of these consequences could have a material  adverse effect on us  our financial condition  and our results of operations 
certain us federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of proposed legislation 
legislation has been proposed that would  if enacted into law  make significant changes to us federal income tax laws  including the elimination of certain key us federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies 
these changes include  but are not limited to  i the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas properties  ii the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs  iii the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities  and iv an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures 
it is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and  if enacted  how soon any such changes could become effective 
the passage of this legislation or any other similar changes in us federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that are currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development  and any such change could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common stock 
our use of oil and natural gas price hedging contracts may limit future revenues from price increases and result in significant fluctuations in our net income 
we use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations 
while the use of hedging transactions limits the downside risk of price declines  their use may also limit future revenues from price increases 
we hedged approximately approximately of natural gas production and approximately of oil production of our total production volumes for the year ended december  
table of contents our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our commodity derivative instruments and fixed price forward sales contracts in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
december  oil and natural gas derivatives in thousands realized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives unrealized gain loss on oil and natural gas derivatives total gain on oil and natural gas derivatives we account for our oil and natural gas derivatives using fair value accounting standards 
each derivative is recorded on the balance sheet as an asset or liability at its fair value 
additionally  changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met at the time the derivative contract is executed 
we have elected not to apply hedge accounting treatment to our swaps and  as such  all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings 
our fixed price physical contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale exception 
contracts that qualify for this treatment do not require mark to market accounting treatment 
in the future  we will be exposed to volatility in earnings resulting from changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments 
see note derivative activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
because our operations require significant capital expenditures  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves  maintain production or maintain interests in our properties 
we must make a substantial amount of capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas reserves 
historically  we have paid for these expenditures with cash from operating activities  proceeds from debt and equity financings and asset sales 
our revenues or cash flows could be reduced because of lower oil and natural gas prices or for other reasons 
if our revenues or cash flows decrease  we may not have the funds available to replace reserves or maintain production at current levels 
if this occurs  our production will decline over time 
other sources of financing may not be available to us if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to fund our capital expenditure requirements 
we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed  and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on more expensive or otherwise unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due or we may be unable to implement our development plan  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
where we are not the majority owner or operator of an oil and natural gas property  we may have no control over the timing or amount of capital expenditures associated with the particular property 
if we cannot fund such capital expenditures  our interests in some properties may be reduced or forfeited 
if we are unable to replace reserves  we may not be able to sustain production at present levels 
our future success depends largely upon our ability to find  acquire or develop additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we replace the reserves we produce through successful development  exploration or acquisition activities  our proved reserves will decline over time 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves by volume at december   were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of proved undeveloped reserves and timing of their production are less certain particularly because we may chose not to develop such reserves on anticipated schedules in future adverse oil or natural gas price environments 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the lack of availability of sufficient capital to fund such future operations could materially hinder or delay our replacement of produced reserves 
we may not be able to successfully find and produce reserves economically in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to acquire proved reserves at acceptable costs 

table of contents we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable proved reserves on a property are revised downward or if oil and natural gas prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
furthermore  any sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices may require us to make further impairments 
we review our proved oil and natural gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and natural gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and natural gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineers estimates of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded impairments related to oil and natural gas properties of million  million and million  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and natural gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
a majority of our production  revenue and cash flow from operating activities are derived from assets that are concentrated in a single geographic area  making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one geographic area 
essentially all of our estimated proved reserves at december   and all our production during were associated with our louisiana  texas and mississippi properties which include the tuscaloosa marine shale  haynesville shale  cotton valley taylor sand and eagle ford shale trend 
accordingly  if the level of production from these properties substantially declines or is otherwise subject to a disruption in our operations resulting from operational problems  government intervention including potential regulation or limitation of the use of high pressure fracture stimulation techniques in these formations or natural disasters  it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production level and our revenue 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest 
for example  chesapeake operates certain properties in the haynesville shale 
we have less ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them versus those fields in which we are the operator 
our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our reduced influence or ability to control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital and lead to unexpected future costs 

table of contents our ability to sell natural gas and receive market prices for our natural gas may be adversely affected by pipeline and gathering system capacity constraints and various transportation interruptions 
we operate primarily in i south texas  which includes the eagle ford shale trend  ii northwest louisiana and east texas  which includes the haynesville shale and cotton valley taylor sand and iii southwest mississippi and southeast louisiana which includes the tuscaloosa marine shale 
a number of companies are currently operating in the haynesville shale and eagle ford shale 
if drilling in these areas continues to be successful  the amount of natural gas being produced could exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available in this region 
if this occurs  it will be necessary for new pipelines and gathering systems to be built 
because of the current economic climate  certain pipeline projects that are planned for northwest louisiana and east texas may not occur or may be substantially delayed for lack of financing 
in addition  capital constraints could limit our ability to build intrastate gathering systems necessary to transport our natural gas to interstate pipelines 
in such an event  we might have to shut in our wells awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity or sell natural gas production at significantly lower prices than those quoted on new york mercantile exchange nymex or that we currently project  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
a portion of our oil and natural gas production in any region may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for numerous reasons  including as a result of weather conditions  accidents  loss of pipeline or gathering system access  field labor issues or strikes  or we might voluntarily curtail production in response to market conditions 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted at the same time  it could temporarily adversely affect our cash flow 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our senior credit facility contains customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our senior credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with all the financial covenants of our senior credit facility 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
the senior credit facility matures on july   which maturity is subject to automatic extension to february   if  prior to maturity  we prepay or escrow certain proceeds sufficient to prepay our million convertible senior notes due any replacement credit facility may have more restrictive covenants or provide us with less borrowing capacity 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  facility or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion or subsurface groundwater contamination  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities relating to the acquired assets and indemnities are unlikely to cover liabilities relating to the time periods after closing 
we may be required to assume any risk relating to the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the incurrence of an unexpected liability could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors 
we compete with major and independent oil and natural gas companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced engineers  geoscientists and other professional staff 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
the oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves many uncertainties  economic risks and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
the nature of the oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves certain operating hazards such as well blowouts  cratering  explosions  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine or well fluids  fires  formations with abnormal pressures  shortages of  or delays in  obtaining water for hydraulic fracturing operations  environmental hazards such as crude oil spills  natural gas leaks  pipeline and tank ruptures  unauthorize discharges of brine  well stimulation and completion fluids or toxic gases into the environment  encountering naturally occuring radioactive materials  other pollution  and other hazards and risks 
any of these operating hazards could result in substantial losses to us 
as a result  substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred 
the payment of these amounts could reduce or eliminate 
table of contents the funds available for exploration  development or acquisitions 
these reductions in funds could result in a loss of our properties 
additionally  some of our oil and natural gas operations are located in areas that are subject to weather disturbances such as hurricanes 
some of these disturbances can be severe enough to cause substantial damage to facilities and possibly interrupt production 
we cannot be certain that the insurance coverage maintained by us will be adequate to cover all losses that may be sustained in connection with all oil and natural gas activities 
we maintain general and excess liability policies  which we consider to be reasonable and consistent with industry standards 
these policies generally cover personal injury  bodily injury  third party property damage  medical expenses  legal defense costs  pollution in some cases  well blowouts in some cases  and workers compensation 
as is common in the oil and natural gas industry  we will not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive 
a loss not fully covered by insurance could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage that we maintain will be sufficient to cover every claim made against us in the future 
a loss in connection with our oil and natural gas properties could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations to the extent that the insurance coverage provided under our policies cover only a portion of any such loss

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in this annual report on form k in item  and the information set forth in risk factors under item a 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of properties primarily in i south texas  which includes the eagle ford shale trend  ii northwest louisiana and east texas  which includes the haynesville shale  bossier shale and cotton valley trends and iii southwest mississippi and southeast louisiana which includes the tuscaloosa marine shale 
we seek to increase shareholder value by growing our oil and natural gas reserves  production revenues and operating cash flow 
in our opinion  on a long term basis  growth in oil and natural gas reserves and production on a cost effective basis are the most important indicators of performance success for an independent oil and natural gas company 
management strives to increase our oil and natural gas reserves  production and cash flow through exploration and development activities 
we develop an annual capital expenditure budget which is reviewed and approved by our board of directors on a quarterly basis and revised throughout the year as circumstances warrant 
we take into consideration our projected operating cash flow and externally available sources of financing  such as bank debt  when establishing our capital expenditure budget 
we place primary emphasis on our cash flow from operating activities operating cash flow in managing our business 
management considers operating cash flow a more important indicator of our financial success than other traditional performance measures such as net income because operating cash flow considers only the cash expenses incurred during the period and excludes the non cash impact of unrealized hedging gains losses  non cash general and administrative expenses and impairments 
our revenues and operating cash flow depend on the successful development of our inventory of capital projects with available capital  the volume and timing of our production  as well as commodity prices for oil and natural gas 
such pricing factors are largely beyond our control  however  we employ commodity hedging techniques in an attempt to minimize the volatility of short term commodity price fluctuations on our earnings and operating cash flow 
business strategy our business strategy is to provide long term growth in reserves on a cost effective basis 
we focus on maximizing our return on capital employed and adding reserve value through the timely development of our eagle ford shale trend  haynesville shale  cotton valley taylor sand and tuscaloosa marine shale acreage 
we regularly evaluate possible acquisitions of prospective acreage and oil and natural gas drilling opportunities 
several of the key elements of our business strategy are the following develop existing property base 
we seek to maximize the value of our existing assets by developing and exploiting our properties with the lowest risk and the highest potential rate of return 
we intend to develop our multi year inventory of drilling locations on our acreage in the eagle ford shale trend  haynesville shale  cotton valley taylor sands and tuscaloosa marine shale in order to develop our oil and natural gas reserves 

table of contents increase our oil production 
during the past several years we have changed our strategy by concentrating on increasing our crude oil production and reserves rather than natural gas by investing and drilling in the eagle ford shale trend and  more recently  tuscaloosa marine shale 
we intend to take advantage of the current favorable sales price of oil compared to the relative sales price of natural gas  and continue to grow our oil production as a percentage of total production 
expand acreage position in emerging shale plays 
as of december   we have acquired approximately  net acres in the tuscaloosa marine shale trend in southeastern louisiana and southwestern mississippi 
we continue to concentrate our efforts in areas where we can apply our technical expertise and where we have significant operational control or experience 
to leverage our extensive regional knowledge base  we seek to acquire leasehold acreage with significant drilling potential in areas that exhibit similar characteristics to our existing properties 
we continually strive to rationalize our portfolio of properties by selling marginal non core properties in an effort to redeploy capital to exploitation  development and exploration projects that offer a potentially higher overall return 
focus on maximizing cash flow margins 
we intend to maximize operating cash flow by focusing on higher margin oil development in the eagle ford shale trend and the tuscaloosa marine shale 
in the current commodity price environment  our eagle ford shale trend and the tuscaloosa marine shale assets offer more attractive cash flow margins than our natural gas assets 
maintain financial flexibility 
as of december   we had a borrowing base of million under our million senior credit facility  of which million was outstanding 
we have historically funded growth through cash flow from operations  debt  equity and equity linked security issuances  divestments of non core assets and entering into strategic joint ventures 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price fluctuations by hedging meaningful portions of our expected production through the use of derivatives  including fixed price swaps  swaptions and collars 
the level of our hedging activity and the duration of the instruments employed depend upon our view of market conditions  available hedge prices and our operating strategy

in december  we participated in our first non operated drilling well in the tuscaloosa marine shale 
during  we conducted drilling operations on approximately six gross two net tuscaloosa marine shale wells 
one gross net drilling well resulted in a mechanical failure in which operations have been suspended 
on february   we announced results of our first operated well  the crosby h well in which we own a working interest 
the well had an initial hour production rate of approximately  boe per day  comprised of  barrels of oil and mcf of gas per day

our net production volumes from our haynesville shale wells aggregated approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total oil and natural gas production for the year 
our capital expenditure budget includes plans to conduct completion operations on gross six net haynesville shale horizontal wells which were previously drilled 
core haynesville shale our core haynesville shale drilling program is primarily concentrated in the bethany longstreet and greenwood waskom fields in caddo and desoto parishes in northwest louisiana 
our core haynesville shale drilling activity includes both operated and non operated drilling in and around our core acreage positions in northwest louisiana 
we currently hold approximately  gross  net acres as of december  our net production volumes from our core haynesville shale wells totaled approximately  mcfe per day in  or approximately of our total production for the year

the number of properties we owned decreased from january  to january  and the assessed values for our properties were lower year to year driven by decreased commodity prices 

table of contents transportation and processing our transportation and processing expense increased in compared to the increase in expense is partially a result of higher gathering costs related to our gas production from the eagle ford shale trend wells but more predominately related to the renegotiation of certain natural gas gathering and processing contracts 
in return for paying higher gathering and processing fees  as compared to gas production from our haynesville shale wells  we are receiving higher pricing due to the existence of natural gas liquids in our natural gas thereby increasing our revenues 
our transportation and processing expense increased in compared to the increase in expense is primarily a result of higher transportation costs related to our new natural gas production from the eagle ford shale trend wells offset by the cost savings from the sale of non core properties in december exploration the increase in exploration expenses in compared to is attributable primarily to million in dry hole expense related to the denkmann h well drilled on our tuscaloosa marine shale acreage

impairment we recorded impairment expense of million in the year ended december   million of which related to our angelina river trend field and is a result of declining natural gas prices 
we calculated the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties based on a natural gas five year average futures strip price of per mmcf 
if natural gas prices decline further we expect to have further impairments 
we recorded impairment expense of million on four fields for the year ended december  the majority is related to our non core beckville field due to falling natural gas prices 
we recorded impairment expense of million on several fields for the year ended december   related primarily to a decreasing projected natural gas price environment resulting in the write down of the carrying values of certain non core assets 
in addition to lower commodity prices  the impairment was a result of our change in forward looking development plans  which will focus on the eagle ford shale trend  core haynesville shale in northwest louisiana and the angelina river trend of the shelby trough 
general and administrative expense our general and administrative g a expense decreased in compared to salaries and payroll taxes were lower in as a result of the timing of filling open positions  partially offset by increased stock compensation for a one time issuance to key personnel

gain on derivatives not designated as hedges we produce and sell oil and natural gas into a market where selling prices are historically volatile 
for example  on november  the henry hub natural gas spot price reached a high of per mmbtu  but the price was down to per mmbtu at april  we enter into swap contracts  swaptions or other derivative agreements from time to time to manage our exposure to commodity price risk for a portion of our production

income tax benefit we recorded no income tax benefit for the years and we increased our valuation allowance and reduced our net deferred tax assets to zero during after considering all available positive and negative evidence related to the realization of our deferred tax assets 
our assessment of the realization of our deferred tax assets has not changed and as a result  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance for our net deferred asset as of december  we recorded a small tax benefit of less than million in  which reflects the monetization of our alternative minimum tax credit

table of contents management believes adjusted ebitdax is a good financial indicator of our ability to internally generate operating funds 
adjusted ebitdax should not be considered an alternative to net income  as defined by gaap 
management believes that this non gaap financial measure provides useful information to investors because it is monitored and used by our management and widely used by professional research analysts in the valuation and investment recommendations of companies within the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
liquidity and capital resources outlook our total capital expenditures for are expected to be between million and million  exclusive of acquisitions other than lease acreage additions in our core areas 
we plan on spending between million and million on drilling and completion cost and million on leasehold and infrastructure costs 
we will concentrate on developing our oil assets in by allocating approximately of our drilling and completion budget to oil directed activity 
oil directed activity will be concentrated in the eagle ford shale and the tuscaloosa marine shale trends 
we plan on spending million in on gas directed activity in the completion of gross net haynesville shale wells that have been previously drilled 
our primary emphasis will be on managing near term growth opportunities 
we believe that our expected level of operating cash flows  cash on hand as of december   and our borrowing base will be sufficient to fund our projected operational and capital programs for however  if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow and cash on hand  funds would likely be supplemented as needed through short term borrowings under senior credit facility or through the issuance of debt or equity 
as we continue to increase our oil production in  we expect that our overall operating expenses will increase as a result of the higher dd a rates associated with oil wells compared to our natural gas wells 
in addition  to support cash flows  we entered into strategic derivative positions as of december   covering approximately of our anticipated oil and condensate sales volumes for see note derivative activities in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
we continuously monitor our leverage position and coordinate our capital program with our expected cash flows and repayment of our projected debt 
we will continue to evaluate funding alternatives as needed 
alternatives available to us include sale of non core assets  joint venture partnerships in our tuscaloosa marine shale  eagle ford shale trend  and or core haynesville shale acreage  availability under our senior credit facility  and issuance of debt or equity securities 
our next borrowing base redetermination is currently scheduled for april at december   our borrowing base under our senior credit facility is million with million outstanding 
our borrowing base is typically reviewed twice annually by our bank group using their price deck applied to our most recent reserve report  in this case as of december  on january  we filed a universal shelf registration statement that  once declared effective by the sec  will provide us with the ability to make registered offerings of various equity or debt securities to the public of up to an aggregate amount of million

summary of critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list in note description of business and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
proved oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves are defined by the sec as those quantities of oil and natural gas which  by analysis of geosciences and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulation before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire  unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain  regardless of whether the estimate is a deterministic estimate or probabilistic estimate 
proved developed reserves are proved reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimates if the extraction is by means not involving a well 
although our external engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  certain of which could be 
table of contents substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates used by us 
we cannot predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods 
while the estimates of our proved reserves at december  included in this report have been prepared based on what we and our independent reserve engineers believe to be reasonable interpretations of the new sec rules  those estimates could differ materially from our actual results 
successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures and to calculate dd a 
unsuccessful exploration wells  as well as other exploration expenditures such as seismic costs  are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs  all development capital expenditures and asset retirement costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by engineers 
leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved oil and natural gas reserves 
fair value measurement fair value is defined by accounting standards codification asc as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we carry our derivative instruments at fair value and measure their fair value by applying the income approach provided for asc  using level inputs based on third party quotes or available interest rate information and commodity pricing data obtained from third party pricing sources and our credit worthiness or that of our counterparties 
we carry our oil and natural gas properties held for use at historical cost 
we use level inputs  which are unobservable data such as discounted cash flow models or valuations  based on our various assumptions and future commodity prices to determine the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties in determining impairment 
we carry cash and cash equivalents  account receivables and payables at carrying value which represent fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
for definitions for level  level and level inputs see note description of business and accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
impairment of properties we monitor our long lived assets recorded in oil and natural gas properties in the consolidated balance sheets to ensure that they are not carried in excess of fair value 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when certain indicators or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
performing these evaluations requires a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable proved and probable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas  and future inflation levels 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas  unfavorable adjustments to reserves or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
we cannot predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future 
asset retirement obligations we make estimates of the future costs of the retirement obligations of our producing oil and natural gas properties in order to record the liability as required by the applicable accounting standard 
this requirement 
table of contents necessitates us to make estimates of our property abandonment costs that  in some cases  will not be incurred until a substantial number of years in the future 
such cost estimates could be subject to significant revisions in subsequent years due to changes in regulatory requirements  technological advances and other factors which may be difficult to predict 
income taxes we are subject to income and other related taxes in areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required by management due to timing and the impact of future events on when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by us 
we periodically evaluate our tax operating loss and other carry forwards to determine whether a gross deferred tax asset  as well as a related valuation allowance  should be recognized in our financial statements 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
see note description of business and accounting policies income taxes and note income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii item of this annual report on form k 
share based compensation plans for all new  modified and unvested share based payment transactions with employees  we measure the fair value on the grant date and recognize it as compensation expense over the requisite period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated using a black scholes option valuation model that requires us to develop estimates for assumptions used in the model 
the black scholes valuation model uses the following assumptions expected volatility  expected term of option  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatility estimates are developed by us based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the grant date 
our common stock does not pay dividends  therefore the dividend yield is zero 
the fair value of restricted stock is measured using the close of the day stock price on the day of the award

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements for any purpose 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks are attributable to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
these fluctuations can affect revenues and cash flow from operating  investing and financing activities 
our risk management policies provide for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments utilized by us include futures  swaps  options and fixed price physical delivery contracts 
the volume of commodity derivative instruments utilized by us may vary from year to year and is governed by risk management policies with levels of authority delegated by the board of directors 
both exchange and over the counter traded commodity derivative instruments may be subject to margin deposit requirements  and we may be required from time to time to deposit cash or provide letters of credit with exchange brokers or its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin requirements

commodity price risk our most significant market risk relates to fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
management expects the prices of these commodities to remain volatile and unpredictable 
as these prices decline or rise significantly  revenues and cash flow will also decline or rise significantly 
in addition  a non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties may be required if future commodity prices experience a sustained and significant decline 
below is a sensitivity analysis of our commodity price related derivative instruments 
we had derivative instruments in place to reduce the price risk associated with production in of approximately  mbbls per day of crude oil as of december  at december   we had a net liability derivative position of million related to these derivative instruments 
utilizing actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in underlying commodity prices would have reduced the fair value of these instruments by approximately million  while a decrease in underlying commodity prices would have increased the fair value of these instruments by approximately million 
however  a gain or loss would be substantially offset by a decrease or increase  respectively  in the actual sales value of production covered by the derivative instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   we had million outstanding variable rate debt and million of principal fixed rate debt 
to the extent we incur borrowings under our senior credit facility  our exposure to variable interest rates will increase 
in the past  we have entered into interest rate swaps to help reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  and we may seek to do so in the future if we deem appropriate 
as of december   we have no interest rate swaps
