item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
overview our principal business is the distribution and marketing of physical medicine products and aesthetic products  many of which we design and manufacture 
we offer a broad line of medical equipment including therapy devices  medical supplies and soft goods  treatment tables and rehabilitation equipment 
our line of aesthetic equipment includes aesthetic massage and microdermabrasion devices  as well as skin care products 
our products are sold to and used primarily by physical therapists  chiropractors  sports medicine practitioners  podiatrists  plastic surgeons  dermatologists  aestheticians and other aesthetic services providers 
our fiscal year ends on june reference to fiscal year refers to the year ended june  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales net sales in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year the  decrease is characterized by sales reductions evenly split between supplies and capital equipment distributed for other manufacturers 
consolidated sales of proprietary manufactured products actually increased over the prior year with more significant gains in sales of the new dynatron solaris plus family of products offsetting lower sales of other proprietary manufactured products 
the decline in sales of products distributed for other manufacturers is attributable to several factors 
approximately of the reduced sales are due to a single manufacturer that changed their distribution paradigm negatively impacting our sales of their products 
the continued general economic weakness in our primary markets combined with uncertainties over anticipation of negative market impacts related to provisions of the affordable care act also contributed to lower sales  particularly of capital equipment 
the reductions in sales of distributed medical supplies during the year include the impact of a single large customer that discontinued operations in early sales of proprietary manufactured physical medicine products represented approximately and of total physical medicine product sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
distribution of products manufactured by other suppliers accounted for the balance of our physical medicine product sales in those years 
sales of manufactured aesthetic products in fiscal years and  represented approximately and of total aesthetic product sales  respectively  with distributed products making up the balance 
the majority of our sales revenues come from the sale of physical medicine products  both manufactured and distributed 
in fiscal years and  sales of physical medicine products accounted for of total sales in both years 
chargeable repairs  billable freight revenue  aesthetic product sales and other miscellaneous revenue accounted for approximately of total revenues in both years 
during the fiscal year ended june   we introduced more new proprietary manufactured products than at any other time in our history 
however  the full impact of these new products will not likely be seen until the next fiscal year 
they do provide a strong foundation for a strategy to reverse the trend of declining sales experienced this past fiscal year 
gross profit gross profit totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in gross profit during the year directly reflects lower sales generated during the current fiscal year as reported above 
lower sales and margins of distributed capital equipment and certain medical supplies were partially offset by higher sales and margins from the new solarisplus and quad products 
overall  gross margin as a percent of sales  remained virtually unchanged 
the implementation of the medical device tax on january   as required by the affordable care act placed a tax on sales of proprietary manufactured products and products imported by us for distribution in the united states 
this tax had the effect of lowering gross profits during the year as it effectively increased the cost of goods sold on all items taxed 
during the fiscal year we paid  in medical device taxes 
management believes that as market demand for our proprietary manufactured products increases in conjunction with the introduction of our new thermostim probe in the quarter ending december   sales growth will resume and  as a result  gross profit will improve 
in addition  as healthcare reform progresses  we expect uncertainty in our market to diminish  confidence to increase and demand for our products to begin to strengthen 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the  decrease in sg a expenses in fiscal year as compared to is a result of the following  of lower selling expenses due primarily to lower sales commissions   of lower labor and overhead costs   of lower general expenses primarily related to a reduction in professional fees 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  management identified over  of new annual cost reductions which are being implemented to further reduce labor and overhead costs and improve operating efficiencies in future periods 
research and development over the last three years  we have undertaken the most extensive research and development r d effort in our history 
more new products have been introduced during this period of time than any period since our formation 
these new products include the quad thermal therapy device  the dynatron solarisplus line of four electrotherapy ultrasound devices enabled to power two phototherapy accessories  the ultra and ultra treatment tables  and the series line of four therapy devices 
with the completion of development of the quad  ultra tables and solarisplus product line  we were able to reduce research and development r d expense during the early part of fiscal year to more normal levels 
r d expenses for were  compared to  in r d expense decreased as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year to from of net sales in fiscal year r d expenses are expected to increase slightly in fiscal year  as a result of the introduction of the new thermostim probe 
however  those increases will mostly be incurred in the first two quarters of the next fiscal year 
r d costs are expensed as incurred 
interest expense interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year due to lower balances on our long term debt compared to fiscal year during fiscal  we paid off the first mortgage on our cottonwood heights facility 
loss before income tax benefit pre tax loss in fiscal year was  compared to  in fiscal year  an improvement of 
the decrease in pre tax loss for resulted from lower selling  labor  and r d expenses 
more specifically  an  reduction in gross margin was offset by reducing sg a and r d expenses by  for the year ended june  it should be noted that during the year we paid  in medical device taxes as required by the affordable care act 
this medical device tax is assessed on sales regardless of profitability 
therefore  despite the fact we did not generate an operating profit we were still required to pay these excise taxes as noted above which contributed to the losses incurred during the fiscal year 
as noted above  we have taken steps to reduce expenses at an annualized amount of approximately  during fiscal year income tax benefit income tax benefit was  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year due to tax benefits associated with r d tax credits and other credits  the effective income tax benefit rate in fiscal year was compared to an effective tax benefit rate of in the difference in the effective tax rates is attributable to lower r d tax credits in fiscal year  as well as certain permanent book to tax differences 
net loss net loss was  
per share in fiscal year  compared to  
per share in fiscal year as reported in the section above entitled loss before income tax benefit  operating losses were reduced by nearly one third in fiscal year compared to fiscal year therefore  the reason net loss increased from  last year to  this year is due to higher income tax benefits last year associated with higher r d tax credits compared to this year 
we expect improved profitability in fiscal year due to the planned introduction of an important new product in the quarter ending december  and with our planned expense reductions which are scheduled to be implemented during the fiscal year liquidity and capital resources we have financed operations through available cash reserves and borrowings under a line of credit with a bank 
working capital was  as of june   inclusive of the current portion of long term obligations and credit facilities  compared to working capital of  as of june  during fiscal year  we generated  in cash from operating activities  used  to pay down principal on long term debt  paid  for capital expenditures primarily related to improving our e commerce and it infrastructure  and paid  to repurchase and retire common stock 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  decreased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  trade accounts receivable represent amounts due from our dealer network as well as from medical practitioners and clinics 
we believe that our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on our historical knowledge and relationship with our customers 
accounts receivable are generally collected within days of the agreed terms 
inventories inventories  net of reserves  increased  or  to  as of june   compared to  as of june  during fiscal year  we increased our inventory of parts in conjunction with the introduction of the dynatron solarisplus product line  ultra tables product line and the series product line 
in addition  inventory levels fluctuate based on the timing of large inventory purchases from overseas suppliers 
accounts payable accounts payable increased  or  to  as of june   from  as of june  the increase in accounts payable is a result of increased inventories  the timing of our weekly payments to suppliers and the timing of purchases of product components 
accounts payable are generally not aged beyond the terms of our suppliers 
we take advantage of available early payment discounts when offered by our vendors 
cash and cash equivalents our cash position as of june  was  compared to cash of  as of june  we expect that cash flows from operating activities  together with amounts available through an existing line of credit facility  will be sufficient to cover operating needs in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months 
if we experience an adverse operating environment  including a further worsening of the general economy in the united states  or unusual capital expenditure requirements  additional financing may be required 
however  no assurance can be given that additional financing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
line of credit during fiscal year  the outstanding balance on our line of credit remained steady with a balance outstanding of  as of june   compared to  as of june  interest on the line of credit is based on the day libor rate as of june  plus 
the line of credit is collateralized by accounts receivable and inventories 
borrowing limitations are based on approximately of eligible inventory and up to of eligible accounts receivable  up to a maximum credit facility of  interest payments on the line are due monthly 
as of june   the borrowing base was approximately  resulting in approximately  available on the line 
the line of credit is renewable on december  and includes covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of june   we were in compliance with the loan covenants or had received waivers of compliance 
if the line of credit is not extended  we will need to find additional sources of financing 
failure to obtain additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
all borrowings under the line of credit are presented as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the current ratio remained constant at to as of june  and june  current assets represented of total assets as of june  compared to as of june  debt long term debt excluding current installments totaled  as of june   compared to  as of june  long term debt is comprised primarily of the mortgage loans on our office and manufacturing facilities in utah and tennessee 
the principal balance on the mortgage loans is approximately  with monthly principal and interest payments of  for a more complete explanation of the long term debt  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable given the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year  for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
the following summary sets forth information regarding significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves the nature of our business requires that we maintain sufficient inventory on hand at all times to meet the requirements of our customers 
we record finished goods inventory at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost first in  first out or market 
raw materials are recorded at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory valuation reserves are maintained for the estimated impairment of the inventory 
impairment may be a result of slow moving or excess inventory  product obsolescence or changes in the valuation of the inventory 
in determining the adequacy of reserves  we analyze the following  among other things current inventory quantities on hand  product acceptance in the marketplace  customer demand  historical sales  forecast sales  product obsolescence  technological innovations  and character of the inventory as a distributed item  finished manufactured item or raw material 
any modifications to estimates of inventory valuation reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold within the statements of operations during the period in which such modifications are determined necessary by management 
as of june  and  our inventory valuation reserve balance  which established a new cost basis  was  and  respectively  and our inventory balance was  and  net of reserves  respectively 
revenue recognition our sales force and distributors sell our products to end users  including physical therapists  professional trainers  athletic trainers  chiropractors  medical doctors and aestheticians 
sales revenues are recorded when products are shipped fob shipping point under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed for shipping and handling of products are recorded as sales revenue 
costs for shipping and handling of products to customers are recorded as cost of sales 
allowance for doubtful accounts we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
in doing so  we analyze historical bad debt trends  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was  and  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  as of june  and  respectively 
deferred income tax assets in assessing the deferred income tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the years in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences 
we have available at june  and federal and state net operating loss nol carry forwards of  and  respectively 
the federal nols will expire in the state nols will expire depending upon the various rules in the states in which we operate 
our federal and state income tax returns for june    and are open tax years 
business plan and outlook during the past three years  we have focused much of our resources and energy on developing new and innovative products 
the scope of that r d effort has been more significant than at any time in our history 
as a result  we have introduced several important new products over the past year 
in june  we began shipping our new dynatron series electrotherapy ultrasound line of combination therapy devices 
this new line consists of four separate devices the dynatron  dynatron  dynatron and dynatron these four units provide seven different types of electrotherapy treatments and three frequencies of ultrasound  including our proprietary three frequency ultrasound transducers 
they are capable of delivering between three and five separate treatments simultaneously  depending on the model 
the ability to provide multiple treatments simultaneously is expected to be very helpful in busy clinics and training rooms  or for patients needing treatment of multiple areas of the body 
this new product line was specially designed to be sold through our expanding channel of general line distributors 
in december  we introduced a new line of motorized treatment tables 
the ultra and ultra are the first two of possibly several other future treatment tables manufactured for us by enraf nonius  a well established manufacturer of physical therapy products in europe 
these tables offer features popular to the practitioner such as full length foot bars that elevate and lower the table height together with a unique wheel raising system that lifts the table allowing an easy change between mobility and stability 
enraf tables are known for their high quality standards and are competitively priced for the us market 
in august  we introduced to the market our new dynatron solarisplus line of electrotherapy ultrasound phototherapy units 
this new product line consists of four new units the dynatron solarisplus    and these attractive new units provide our most advanced technology in combination therapy devices by adding phototherapy capabilities to enhanced electrotherapy and ultrasound combination devices 
the dynatron solarisplus line of products features a tri wave phototherapy probe and a tri wave phototherapy pad 
tri wave phototherapy features infrared  red and blue wavelength light 
the new dynatron solaris tri wave phototherapy pad is capable of treating large areas of the body via unattended infrared  red and blue wavelength phototherapy 
the tri wave phototherapy probe allows the practitioner to treat specific  targeted areas of the body in an attended treatment 
as part of the solarisplus product line  we also introduced a new display cart specifically designed for these units 
the solarisplus line is expected to quickly become popular for its power and versatility 
the new units are capable of simultaneously powering five electrotherapy channels  ultrasound therapy  a phototherapy probe and phototherapy pad 
no other device on the market offers such powerful simultaneous combination therapies 
in the quarter ended december   we anticipate introducing the thermostim probe one of the most innovative and revolutionary products in our history 
the thermostim probe will offer the ability to do thermal therapy hot and cold and or electrotherapy in a targeted  attended treatment 
the hand held probe is an accessory to the dynatron solarisplus family of products 
unlike its predecessor  also called the thermostim probe  this new probe does not require a water source to heat and cool the surface of the treatment face 
instead  a thermoelectric chip powers the thermal therapy controlled by the dynatron solarisplus console 
this innovative probe is expected to generate significant demand not only for the probe  but also for the new solarisplus units which serve as the control console for the probe 
it will be the catalyst to boost sales and attract new distributors beginning midway through fiscal year with most of the planned new products now released  r d costs cycled back to a lower level more in line with historical amounts during fiscal year those r d costs are expected to rise again during the first part of fiscal year as the new thermostim probe is finalized 
management is confident the investments made in r d will yield long term benefits and are important to assuring that we maintain our reputation in the industry for being an innovator and leader in product development 
in april  we began shipping the newly updated version of our product catalog to customers 
this new catalog not only includes our new proprietary products previously discussed  but also expands our offering of non proprietary products by hundreds of items in order to better service the broader needs of our customers 
it also provides an excellent new sales tool for all of our sales representatives in the field and the foundation for expanding our e commerce platform 
the new catalog includes an online electronic version of the catalog that is incorporated into our e commerce website 
the new catalog has been praised for its clarity and ease of use 
over the past few years  consolidations in our market have changed the landscape of our industry s distribution channels 
at the present time  we believe that there remain only two companies with a national direct sales force selling proprietary and distributed products dynatronics and patterson medical 
all other distribution in our market is directed through catalog companies with a limited direct sales force  or through independent local dealers that have limited geographical reach 
in the past year  we have reinforced our direct sales team that includes over direct sales employees and independent sales representatives 
in addition to these direct sales representatives  we continue to enjoy a strong relationship with scores of independent dealers 
we believe we have the best trained and most knowledgeable sales force in the industry 
we are actively seeking to expand our market penetration through increased distribution 
to accomplish this  we have  for the first time in our history  made available to all distributors and qualified sales persons  a family of proprietary combination therapy devices  the dynatron series 
the availability of these products is attracting new distributors and sales persons 
in addition  where these sales persons have had limited or no access to premier lines like the dynatron solarisplus products  they will now be able to access these products in certain geographical areas through the authorized sales representative or dealer who has the rights to the products in those territories 
making these products more widely available will increase our ability to expand distribution of not only our own proprietary products  but also those we distribute on behalf of other manufacturers 
this strategic expansion of distribution will begin to hit stride as the new thermostim product is released in the second fiscal quarter of pursuit of national accounts  including group purchasing organizations gpo continues to be a strategic endeavor 
however  securing such accounts has proven to be elusive as entrenched suppliers seem to dominate many of the large gpo accounts 
as a result  we have turned our attention more toward accessible national and regional accounts where we can more easily prove our value proposition 
while we have not abandoned efforts to secure gpo and large national account business  we have become more strategic in our approach to such business 
last year we were successful in qualifying to be an approved vendor to the federal government  including the veterans administration hospitals and medical facilities associated with military installations 
these types of contracts are strategically more accessible for us than gpo business 
economic pressures from the recent recession in the united states have affected available credit that would facilitate large capital purchases  and have also reduced demand for discretionary services such as those provided by the purchasers of our aesthetic products 
as a result  we reduced our expenses in the synergie department 
we believe that our aesthetic devices remain the best value on the market and we are seeking innovative ways to market these products  including strategic partnerships  both domestic and international  to help enhance sales momentum 
we have long believed that international markets present an untapped potential for growth and expansion 
adding new distributors in several countries will be the key to this expansion effort 
we remain committed to finding the most effective ways to expand our markets internationally 
over the coming year  our efforts will be focused on partnering with key manufacturers and distributors interested in our product line or technology 
our utah facility  where all electrotherapy  ultrasound  traction  phototherapy and synergie products are manufactured  is certified to iso  an internationally recognized standard of excellence in medical device manufacturing 
this designation is an important requirement in obtaining the ce mark certification  which allows us to market our products in the european union and in other international locations 
the introduction of several important new products has generated new interest on the part of some foreign distributors in asia  europe and south america 
as we secure ce mark certification for our products we will be better able to explore the interest of these distributors 
refining our business model for supporting sales representatives and distributors will also be a focal point of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the most efficient ways to maintain our satellite sales offices and warehouses 
the ongoing refinement of this model is expected to yield further efficiencies that will better achieve sales goals while  at the same time  reduce expenses 
our efforts to prudently reduce costs in the face of some economic uncertainty have made us a leaner operation 
during fiscal year we implemented almost  in expense reductions 
so far in fiscal we have identified another  annually in cost savings that have been or will be implemented to reduce expenses 
we will continue to be vigilant in maintaining appropriate overhead costs and operating costs while still providing support for anticipated increases in sales from our new products 
based on our defined strategic initiatives  we are focusing our resources in the following areas increasing market share of manufactured capital products by promoting sales of our new state of the art dynatron solarisplus and series products 
introducing additional new products such as the thermostim probe to better capitalize on opportunities in our core markets 
seeking to improve distribution of our products through recruitment of additional qualified sales representatives and dealers attracted by the many new products being offered and expanding the availability of proprietary combination therapy devices 
increasing market share with our new product catalog featuring a broader product offering 
continue to seek ways of increasing business with gpos  as well as through gsa contracts with the us government and to national and regional accounts 
improving operational efficiencies by scaling costs to be reflective of current levels of sales 
strengthening pricing management and procurement methodologies 
minimizing expense associated in the synergie department until demand for capital equipment re emerges  and  in the meantime  seeking additional independent distributors and strategic partnerships 
focusing international sales efforts on identifying key distributors and strategic partners who could represent the company s product line  particularly in europe and china 
exploring strategic business alliances that will leverage and complement our competitive strengths  increase market reach and supplement capital resources
