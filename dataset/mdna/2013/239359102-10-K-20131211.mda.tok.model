overview we are a leading provider of onshore seismic data acquisition services in the lower states of the united states 
during  we entered the canadian market by forming a new canadian subsidiary  which operated during the winter season 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients  mainly domestic oil and natural gas companies 
demand for our services depends upon the level of spending by these companies for exploration  production  development and field management activities  which depends  in part  on oil and natural gas prices 
significant fluctuations in domestic oil and natural gas exploration activities and commodity prices have affected the demand for our services  the number of crews we operate and our results of operations in years past  and such fluctuations continue to be the single most important factor affecting our business and results of operations 

table of contents during the majority of the and fiscal years we operated fourteen data acquisition crews 
during fiscal  we mostly operated fourteen data acquisition crews  except in the last fiscal quarter of when demand dictated we operate eight data acquisition crews 
we have maintained a balanced order book in terms of the client mix and geographical diversity with the majority of the projects in oil and liquids rich basins 
the majority of our crews are currently working in oil producing basins 
however  in recent years  we have experienced periods in which the services we provided were primarily to clients seeking natural gas 
while our revenues are mainly affected by the level of client demand for our services  our revenues are also affected by the pricing for our services that we negotiate with our clients and the productivity and utilization level of our data acquisition crews 
factors impacting productivity and utilization levels include crew downtime related to inclement weather  delays in acquiring land access permits  agricultural or hunting activity  holiday schedules  short winter days  crew repositioning or equipment failure  whether we enter into turnkey or term contracts with our clients  the number and size of crews and the number of recording channels per crew 
to the extent we experience these factors  our operating results may be affected from quarter to quarter 
consequently  our efforts to negotiate favorable contract terms in our supplemental service agreements  to mitigate permit access delays and to improve overall crew productivity may contribute to growth in our revenues 
as demand for our services continues to be steady  we were able to negotiate more favorable contract terms during fiscal and we experienced lower utilization rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal as our crews were affected by project preparation issues due to agricultural operation in key regions  weather delays  land access permit issues and softness in bid activity during the third fiscal quarter of our utilization rates were also affected by increasing crew efficiencies driven by improved crew processes and recent equipment purchases 
in several instances during the third fiscal quarter of  our data acquisition crews completed projects ahead of schedule and were idled in the fourth fiscal quarter as other projects were in preparatory and or permitting phases 
these reduced utilization rates negatively impacted our financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter of while these early project completions have a negative impact on utilization during the quarter in which they occur  we believe the increasing efficiency of our crews may enable us to increase our overall capacity 
as a result of the factors discussed above  we operated the equivalent of eight crews during the fourth fiscal quarter 
the company retained all key personnel required to redeploy existing crews during the period of low utilization 
we believe that the problems that led to lower utilization rates during the fourth quarter of fiscal have been resolved and we returned to full utilization with the operation of twelve large channel crews and one small channel crew in the middle of the first fiscal quarter of although our clients may cancel  delay or alter their service contracts on short notice and we continue to remain subject to land access permit and weather delays  our current order book reflects commitment levels sufficient to maintain operation of twelve large channel crews and one small channel crew into the middle of fiscal currently  most of our client contracts are turnkey contracts 
the percentage of revenues derived from turnkey contracts has represented approximately three quarters of our revenues in fiscal and for the past few years 
while turnkey contracts allow us to capitalize on improved crew productivity  we also bear more risks related to weather and crew downtime 
we expect the percentage of turnkey contracts to remain high as we continue to expand our operations in mid continent  western and southwestern regions of the united states in which turnkey contracts are more common 
over time  we have experienced continued increases in recording channel capacity on a per crew or project basis 
this increase in channel count demand is driven by client needs and is necessary in order to produce higher resolution images  increase crew efficiencies and undertake larger scale projects 
due to the increase in demand for higher channel counts  we have continued our investments in additional channels 
in response to project based channel requirements  we routinely deploy a variable number of channels on a variable number of crews in an effort to maximize asset utilization and meet client needs 
we believe we will realize the benefit of increased channel counts and flexibility of deployment through increased crew efficiencies  higher revenues and margins 
reimbursable third party charges related to our use of helicopter support services  permit support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources in areas with limited access are another important 
table of contents factor affecting our results 
revenues associated with third party charges declined as a percentage of revenue during fiscal and as a result of such third party charges falling at or below our historical average 
we expect that as we continue to expand our operations in the more open terrain of the mid continent  western and southwestern regions of the united states  the level of these third party charges will continue to be generally within or below our historical range of to of revenue 
as a result of the introduction of the cable less recording systems in and  we have realized increased crew efficiencies and increased revenue on projects using these cable less technologies 
in response to the continued demand for cable less recording systems  in the first quarter of fiscal we purchased  channels of wireless seismic rt system   single channel geospace technologies gsx units and four channel geospace technologies gsr units 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased  three channel geospace technologies gsx units  bringing our total fiscal investment in cable less recording channels to  as we have replaced cable based recording equipment with cable less equipment on certain crews  the cable based recording equipment continues to be deployed on existing crews as needed and we continue to phase out the older i o rsr recording systems 
of the thirteen crews currently in operation  one uses a leased fairfieldnodal zland cable less recording system  one uses the wireless seismic rt system  six use geospace technologies gsr recording systems and five use aram cable based recording systems 
during fiscal  we continued a large project that will continue well into in southern new mexico utilizing the fairfieldnodal zland cable less recording system 
during  we entered into the canadian market 
this market is highly seasonal and operates primarily from late november through march  depending upon weather conditions 
during fiscal  canadian operations did not significantly affect our fiscal financial results  although the canadian operations did impact the year over year comparisons 
while the winter season was not as robust as anticipated  we completed our first multi component d survey in canada  secured necessary industry safety audits and believe we performed at a high level of efficiency as a new entrant into the canadian market 
we anticipate operating one crew on two projects in canada in the winter season and do not expect these operations to have a significant impact on our fiscal financial results 
during fiscal  we began providing surface recorded microseismic services to some of our clients 
microseismic monitoring is used by clients who use hydraulic fracturing to extract hydrocarbon deposits to monitor their hydraulic fracturing operations 
we completed several projects in fiscal and believe our microseismic business will continue to provide growth opportunities 
these operations did not have a significant impact on our fiscal financial results  nor do we expect these operations to significantly impact our fiscal financial results 
while the markets for oil and natural gas have been very volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future  and we can make no assurances as to future levels of domestic exploration or commodity prices  we believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our market position by responding to our clients continuing desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
if economic conditions were to weaken  our clients reduce their capital expenditures or there is a significant sustained drop in oil and natural gas prices  it would result in diminished demand for our seismic services  could cause downward pressure on the prices we charge and would affect our results of operations 
fiscal highlights ebitda for the year ended september  increased to  compared to  for the same period of fiscal  an increase of percent  income from operations for fiscal increased percent to  from  in fiscal  
table of contents net income for the year ended september  of  or per share attributable to common stock  compared to net income of  or per share attributable to common stock in fiscal included in the fiscal results is a per share one time tax benefit related to a terminated merger agreement  revenues of  for the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september   revenues net of third party reimbursable charges increased percent in fiscal from fiscal  fiscal capital expenditures of  compared to  in fiscal  purchased  single channel geospace gsx units   three channel gsx units   channels of the wireless seismic rt system recording system and inova vibrator energy source units to increase recording capacity and improve efficiency  deployed a small crew equipped with  channels of the wireless seismic rt system recording system for small d and d projects as well as microseismic applications  completed several surface recording microseismic projects  completed first winter season of operations in canada  balanced portfolio of projects primarily in the eagle ford shale  niobrara shale  bakken shale  marcellus shale  permian basin including the cline shale and wolfcamp areas  and mississippi lime of kansas and oklahoma  and approximately million of working capital at september  results of operations fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of a significant decrease in third party charges during fiscal as compared to fiscal and a decrease in crew utilization during the fourth fiscal quarter 
third party charges related to our use of helicopter support services  specialized survey technologies and dynamite energy sources in areas of limited access decreased in fiscal from fiscal we are reimbursed for these third party charges by our clients 
the decline in third party charges is primarily a result of our continued operations in the more wide open terrain of the western united states 
fee revenue net of third party charges for fiscal increased from fiscal the increase in revenues net of third party charges during fiscal is a result of an overall increase in production and more favorable contract terms in as compared to increased utilization and the use of cable less equipment contributed to our increased production in fiscal other factors contributing nominally to our increased fee revenue net of third party changes included our line clearing services initiated during fiscal and the completion of our first canadian winter season 
despite decreases in third party charges and increases in fee revenues net of third party charges between fiscal and  we experienced increases in third party charges  which we believe are temporary  and decreases in fee revenue net of third party charges in our fourth fiscal quarter 
operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in reimbursed third party charges 
as discussed above  third party charges decreased in fiscal from fiscal operating expenses excluding third party charges in fiscal increased from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased field personnel and other expenses associated with higher utilization in as compared to and expenses associated with our first canadian winter season 
since the increase in fee revenues net of third party charges in fiscal exceeded the growth of operating costs excluding third party charges  our margins improved during fiscal improved turnkey rates  increased productivity  reduced third party charges and reduced equipment rental and repair costs all contributed to this improvement in margins 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and represented of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the primary factor for the increase in general and administrative expenses was additional administrative costs to support our canadian operations 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation expense increased from fiscal to reflecting increased capital expenditures during fiscal our depreciation expense is expected to continue to increase in fiscal as a result of our significant capital expenditures in fiscal our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
income taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the effective tax rates for the income tax provision for fiscal and were and  respectively 
in fiscal  transaction costs that had been treated as permanent  non deductible expenses in fiscal became fully tax deductible upon the merger s termination and were treated as a discrete event in fiscal  which resulted in an income tax benefit 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  discrete items  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
fiscal year ended september  versus fiscal year ended september  operating revenues 
our operating revenues decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the revenue decrease in fiscal was primarily the result of a significant decrease in third party charges and is not indicative of declining operations 
third party charges decreased in fiscal from fiscal due to continued operations in the more wide open terrain of the western united states while fee revenue net of third party charges for fiscal increased from fiscal the increase in revenues net of third party charges is a result of increased utilization  production and more favorable contract terms in as compared to operating costs 
our operating expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the decrease in reimbursed charges 
as discussed above  third party charges decreased in fiscal from fiscal operating expenses excluding third party charges in fiscal increased from fiscal this increase resulted primarily from increased field personnel and other expenses associated with higher utilization in as compared to the increase in revenues net of third party charges of in fiscal at the same time operating costs excluding third party charges increased only resulted in an overall improvement in our margins during fiscal improved turnkey rates  increased productivity  reduced third party charges and reduced equipment rental and repair costs all contributed to this improvement in margins 
general and administrative expenses were of revenues in fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the primary factor for the decrease in general and administrative expenses was the absence during fiscal of fiscal transaction costs of  associated with the terminated merger agreement with tgc 
without the effect of the transaction costs  general and administrative expense increased by  the increase in administrative expense was primarily due to increased employee costs to support expanded field operations and start up costs associated with our canadian operations 
we recognized  of depreciation expense in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation expense increased from fiscal to reflecting increased capital expenditures during fiscal and 
table of contents our total operating costs for fiscal were  a decrease of from fiscal primarily due to the factors described above 
income taxes 
income tax expense was  for fiscal and  for fiscal the effective tax rates for the income tax provision for fiscal and were and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was reduced significantly in fiscal by transaction costs that had been treated as permanent  non deductible expenses 
in fiscal  these costs became fully tax deductible upon the merger s termination and were treated as a discrete event in the first quarter of fiscal  which resulted in an income tax benefit 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  discrete items  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
use of ebitda non gaap measure we define ebitda as net income loss plus interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense 
our management uses ebitda as a supplemental financial measure to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structures  taxes or historical cost basis  our liquidity and operating performance over time in relation to other companies that own similar assets and that we believe calculate ebitda in a similar manner  and the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient for us to pay potential interest costs 
we also understand that such data are used by investors to assess our performance 
however  the term ebitda is not defined under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and ebitda is not a measure of operating income  operating performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
when assessing our operating performance or liquidity  investors and others should not consider this data in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss  cash flow from operating activities or other cash flow data calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our ebitda may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures utilized by other companies since such other companies may not calculate ebitda in the same manner as us 
further  the results presented by ebitda cannot be achieved without incurring the costs that the measure excludes interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the reconciliation of our ebitda to our net income loss and net cash provided by operating activities  which are the most directly comparable gaap financial measures  are provided in the tables below reconciliation of ebitda to net income loss years ended september  in thousands net income loss depreciation interest expense income  net income tax expense ebitda 
table of contents reconciliation of ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities years ended september  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities changes in working capital and other items noncash adjustments to income ebitda liquidity and capital resources introduction 
our principal sources of cash are amounts earned from the seismic data acquisition services we provide to our clients 
our principal uses of cash are the amounts used to provide these services  including expenses related to our operations and acquiring new equipment 
accordingly  our cash position depends as do our revenues on the level of demand for our services 
historically  cash generated from our operations along with cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks have been sufficient to fund our working capital requirements  and to some extent  our capital expenditures 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for fiscal and  for fiscal these amounts primarily reflect an increase in operating margins and steady revenues between periods 
our cash provided by operations was further positively impacted by cash collected from prior periods 
our collection experience during the period expressed as an average number of days in accounts receivable has remained at approximately sixty over the last twelve months 
amounts in our trade accounts receivable that are over sixty days as of september  represents less than of our total trade accounts receivables  which is below our historical levels 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at september  is adequate to cover exposures related to our trade account balances 
net cash used in investing activities was  in fiscal and  in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal and of  and  respectively  net of noncash capital expenditures and noncash capital lease obligations  were funded from excess cash reserves and cash flow from operations 
proceeds of  from our third term note as defined below and  from our second term note as defined below supplemented the capital expenditure purchases in and  respectively 
during fiscal and  excess cash reserves and maturities of certificates of deposit of  and  respectively  were invested in  and  of certificates of deposit  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities in fiscal of  primarily includes  in proceeds from our third term note that was used to purchase equipment for our canadian operations and principal payments for all three term notes of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  that primarily represented  in proceeds from our second term note that were used to purchase geospace technologies gsr recording equipment and subsequent principal payments for both the term note as defined below and second term note of  capital expenditures 
for fiscal year  we made capital expenditures of  primarily to purchase  single channel geospace technologies gsx units   three channel geospace technologies gsx units  four channel geospace technologies gsr units  for a total increase of  in geospace cable less recording channels 
in addition  we purchased  aram aries recording channels   channels of wireless seismic rt system  additional conventional geophones  vehicles to improve our fleet and to meet necessary maintenance capital requirements 
these purchases reflect our belief that the trend towards increased channel counts and energy sources in our industry will continue 
our board of directors has approved an initial fiscal capital budget of  which will be used  in part  to purchase additional vibrator energy sources units  increase channel count  make technical improvements in various phases of our operations 
table of contents and meet maintenance capital requirements 
we believe that these additions will allow us to maintain our competitive position as we respond to client desire for higher resolution subsurface images 
we continually strive to supply our clients with technologically advanced d data acquisition recording services and data processing capabilities 
we maintain equipment in and out of service in anticipation of increased future demand for our services 
capital resources 
historically  we have primarily relied on cash generated from operations  cash reserves and borrowings from commercial banks to fund our working capital requirements and  to some extent  our capital expenditures 
recently  we have funded some of our capital expenditures through equipment term loans and capital leases 
we have also funded our capital expenditures and other financing needs from time to time through public equity offerings 
our revolving line of credit loan agreement is with western national bank 
the agreement was renewed june  under the same terms as the previous agreement and permits us to borrow  repay and reborrow  from time to time until june   up to million based on the borrowing base calculation as defined in the agreement 
our obligations under this agreement are secured by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral 
interest on the facility accrues at an annual rate equal to either the day london interbank offered rate libor  plus two and one quarter percent  or the prime rate  minus three quarters percent  as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of 
interest on the outstanding amount under the loan agreement is payable monthly 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants for credit facilities of this type  including limitations on disposition of assets  mergers and reorganizations 
we are also obligated to meet certain financial covenants under the loan agreement  including maintaining specified ratios with respect to cash flow coverage  current assets and liabilities and debt to tangible net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants including specified ratios as of september  and have the full line of credit available for borrowing 
we have not utilized the revolving line of credit during the fiscal years ended september  or our credit loan agreement includes a term loan feature under which we have two outstanding term loans 
these term loans were confirmed and brought under the renewed credit loan agreement in june on june   we entered into a first term loan by obtaining  in financing for the purchase of geospace technologies gsr equipment term note 
the term note is repayable over a period of months at  per month plus any applicable interest in excess of 
the term note bears interest at an annual rate equal to either the day libor  plus two and one quarter percent  or the prime rate  minus three quarters percent  as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of  and otherwise has the same terms as our revolving line of credit 
the term note is collateralized by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral and matures with all outstanding balances due on june  on may   we entered into a multiple advance term note second term note under our credit loan agreement 
the second term note allows us to borrow from time to time up to million to purchase equipment 
on july   we borrowed  under the second term note to purchase geospace technologies gsr recording equipment 
the outstanding principal under the second term note is amortized over months 
the second term note bears interest at an annual rate equal to either the day libor  plus two and one quarter percent  or the prime rate  minus three quarters percent  as we direct monthly  subject to an interest rate floor of  and otherwise has the same terms as our revolving line of credit 
the second term note is collateralized by a security interest in our accounts receivable  equipment and related collateral and matures with all outstanding balances due on may  see additional discussion in note  subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
on february   our subsidiary dawson seismic services ulc dss entered into a promissory note third term note with wells fargo equipment finance company 
dss obtained  in financing for the purchase of equipment 
the third term note is repayable over a period of months at  per month and bears interest at an implied annual fixed rate of 
the third term note is collateralized by a security interest in the dss equipment and matures with all outstanding balances due on february  
table of contents in the second quarter of fiscal  we began leasing vehicles from enterprise fleet management under capital leases 
these capital lease obligations are payable in to monthly installments and mature between december and november at september   we had leased vehicles under these capital leases 
the following table summarizes payments due in specific periods related to our contractual obligations with initial terms exceeding one year as of september  payments due by period in s contractual obligations total within year years years after years operating lease obligations office space capital lease obligations debt obligations total in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec covering the periodic offer and sale of up to million in debt securities  preferred and common stock and warrants 
the registration statement allows us to sell securities in one or more separate offerings with the size  price and terms to be determined at the time of sale 
the terms of any securities offered would be described in a related prospectus to be filed separately with the sec at the time of the offering 
the filing of the shelf registration statement will enable us to act quickly if and when opportunities arise 
we believe that our capital resources and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our current operational needs 
we believe we will be able to finance our capital requirements through cash generated from operations  cash on hand  through borrowings under our revolving line of credit  additional equipment term loans and capital leases 
however  our ability to satisfy our working capital requirements and fund future capital requirements will depend principally upon our future operating performance  which is subject to the risks inherent in our business  including the demand for our seismic services from clients 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
effect of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
because of the use of assumptions and estimates inherent in the reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we prepare our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our review of past due accounts  our past experience of historical write offs and our current client base 
while the collectability of outstanding client invoices is continually assessed  the inherent volatility of the energy industry s business cycle can cause swift and unpredictable changes in the financial stability of our clients 

table of contents property  plant and equipment 
our property  plant and equipment is capitalized at historical cost and depreciated over the useful life of the asset 
our estimation of this useful life is based on circumstances that exist in the seismic industry and information available at the time of the purchase of the asset 
as circumstances change and new information becomes available  these estimates could change 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet  and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the results of operations for the period 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment when triggering events occur suggesting deterioration in the assets recoverability or fair value 
recognition of an impairment charge is required if future expected undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets and the fair value of the assets is below the carrying value of the assets 
our forecast of future cash flows used to perform impairment analysis includes estimates of future revenues and expenses based on our anticipated future results while considering anticipated future oil and gas prices  which is fundamental in assessing demand for our services 
if the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows  we measure the amount of possible impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its fair value 
revenue recognition 
our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
these contracts are either turnkey or term agreements 
under both types of agreements  we recognize revenues when revenue is realizable and services are performed 
services are defined as the commencement of data acquisition or processing operations 
revenues are considered realizable when earned according to the terms of the service contracts 
under turnkey agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of data acquired rate  as services are performed 
under term agreements  revenue is recognized on a per unit of time worked rate  as services are performed 
in the case of a cancelled service contract  we recognize revenue and bill our client for services performed up to the date of cancellation 
we also receive reimbursements for certain out of pocket expenses under the terms of our service contracts 
we record amounts billed to clients in revenue at the gross amount including out of pocket expenses that are reimbursed by the client 
in some instances  we bill clients in advance of the services performed 
in those cases  we recognize the liability as deferred revenue 
as services are performed  those deferred revenue amounts are recognized as revenue 
in some instances  the contract contains certain permitting  surveying and drilling costs that are incorporated into the per unit of data acquired rate 
in these circumstances  these set up costs that occur prior to initiating revenue recognition are capitalized and amortized as data is acquired 
stock based compensation 
we measure all employee stock based compensation awards  which include stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  using the fair value method and recognize compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures  in our financial statements 
we record compensation expense as operating or general and administrative expense as appropriate in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss consolidated statements of operations on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock options or restricted stock awards 
income taxes 
we account for our income taxes with the recognition of amounts of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and by using an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we determine deferred taxes by identifying the types and amounts of existing temporary differences  measuring the total deferred tax asset or liability using the applicable tax rate in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the year of an enacted rate change 
the 
table of contents deferred tax asset is reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our methodology for recording income taxes requires judgment regarding assumptions and the use of estimates  including determining our annual effective tax rate and the valuation of deferred tax assets  which can create a variance between actual results and estimates and could have a material impact on our provision or benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory federal rate of for certain items such as state and local taxes  non deductible expenses  discrete items  expenses related to share based compensation that were not expected to result in a tax deduction and changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  that updated guidance related to disclosure of reclassification amounts out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the standard requires that companies present  either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
asu was effective for us as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes to operating concentration of credit risk and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreements  commodity futures  options or other derivative financial instruments 
during  we began to conduct business in canada which subjects our results of operations and cash flow to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
concentration of credit risk 
our principal market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices  which affect demand for and pricing of our services  and the risk related to the concentration of our clients in the oil and natural gas industry 
since all of our clients are involved in the oil and natural gas industry  there may be a positive or negative effect on our exposure to credit risk because our clients may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
as an example  changes to existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers or our clients 
in the normal course of business  we provide credit terms to our clients 
accordingly  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our clients and maintain allowances for possible losses 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts of  at september  is adequate to cover exposures related to our trade account balances 
we generally provide services to certain key clients that account for a significant percentage of our accounts receivable at any given time 
our key clients vary over time 
we extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry  including our key clients  for the acquisition of seismic data  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
this concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key clients and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
if any of these significant clients were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired  alter their exploration or development strategy  or for any other reason  our results of operations could be affected 
because of the nature of our contracts and clients projects  our largest clients can change from year to year  and the largest clients in any year may not be indicative of the largest clients in any subsequent year 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on the outstanding indebtedness under our credit loan agreement  which has variable interest rates 
amounts drawn under the revolving line of credit and equipment term loans bear interest at variable rates based on the lower of the prime rate  minus three quarters percent  or the day libor  plus a margin of two and one quarter percent  subject to an interest rate floor of for the term note and the revolving line of credit and an interest rate floor of for the second 
table of contents term note 
at september   our interest rate was for the term note and the revolving line of credit and for the second term note 
we have cash in the bank which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
historically  we have not experienced any losses in such accounts  however  volatility in financial markets may impact our credit risk on cash and short term investments 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled
