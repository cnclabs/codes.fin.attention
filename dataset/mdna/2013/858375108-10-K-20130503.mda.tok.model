the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties  and our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the table of contents 
overview we are a national retailer offering the fashion merchandise  service and presentation of a better department or specialty store at prices comparable to off price retail chains 
our focused assortment of merchandise features current season moderate to better fashion apparel for women and men  as well as accessories  shoes and home fashions 
highlights comparable store sales for increased percent compared to and total sales increased percent 
net income for was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share for cash and cash equivalents at year end was million after payment of a million dividend  compared to million at year end we had no outstanding debt at fiscal year end 
outlook in  we are continuing to embrace our value proposition with controlled couponing and even lower prices on selected merchandise 
our goal is to build on the sales increases we experienced in primarily by deepening our relationship with existing customers  attracting new customers and increasing our share of existing customers spending 
we expect the following factors to influence our business in the gross profit rate is expected to be slightly lower than in as we continue to manage our selling prices and couponing and from lower margins on e commerce sales in the second half of the year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses are expected to increase approximately million as a result of the following we will incur approximately million in start up costs related to the launch of our new e commerce business and the transition of our supply chain from third party to company operated locations 
depreciation will increase by approximately million as a result of recent years investments in capital 
sg a included the impact of certain expenses and income not expected to reoccur in  including million of professional fees related to the restatement of our financial statements and million of breakage income on unused gift and merchandise return cards as a result of changes in breakage assumptions 
the effective tax rate for the year is expected to be approximately percent 
current plans are to open four stores  close three stores and relocate four stores to better locations in their respective markets in capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million  including million for continuing information system upgrades  million for distribution center equipment and software  and the remainder for new and relocated stores  store remodels and new fixtures 
we will be launching our new e commerce business in mid to late with a representative merchandise selection 
this will enable us to reach new customers and increase our share of existing customers spend through a multi channel approach 
as noted above  this initiative will actually have a negative bottom line impact in from start up costs and margins that are lower than for our brick and mortar stores due to relatively high fulfillment costs at our initial expected sales volume levels 
this is an important initiative from which we expect significant future benefit as we grow our sales 
another important initiative for is the transition of our supply chain distribution centers from third party to company operated locations beginning in the second quarter 
while this change will not result in an immediate savings in distribution expenses due to start up costs and an initial capital investment in equipment and software  this initiative offers an excellent return on our investment with positive impact starting in

liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is the sale of merchandise inventories 
capital requirements and working capital needs are funded through a combination of internally generated funds  available cash  credit terms from vendors and our revolving credit facility 
working capital is needed to support store inventories and capital investments for new store openings and to maintain existing stores 
historically  our working capital needs are lowest in the first quarter and highest at the end of the third quarter and beginning of the fourth quarter as we build inventories for the holiday selling season 
as of february   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of borrowing availability under our credit agreement 
we believe that we will continue to generate positive cash flows from operations on a full year basis 
internally generated cash  along with our available cash and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreement  will provide the means needed to fund our operations 
the following table presents cash flows data for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal in thousands cash provided by used in restated restated operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal cash provided by operating activities results primarily from operating income and changes in working capital

capital expenditures in  and include approximately million  million and million  respectively  for systems improvements  with the largest portion for our new merchandise information system 
the remaining capital amounts are for opening and remodeling stores  including upgrades to fitting rooms  lighting  flooring and fixtures 
we also replaced our point of sale system hardware during  primarily with assets acquired through capital leases 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures in  with million for continuing information systems upgrades  million for distribution center equipment and software and the remainder for new and relocated stores  store remodels and new fixtures 
the cost of opening a new store ranges from  to  for fixtures  equipment  leasehold improvements and pre opening costs primarily advertising  stocking and training 
pre opening costs are expensed at the time of opening 
initial inventory investment for a new store is approximately  
table of contents cash used in financing activities financing activities in include million for payment of a special dividend of per share 
financing activities for also include million for payment of a special dividend of per share 
there were no dividends paid in during we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
during we repurchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million compared to million shares at a cost of million in capital lease payments were million and million for and  respectively 
there were no capital lease payments in in october  we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na the credit agreement provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility which can be increased to million 
the credit agreement matures on february  the amount available for borrowing was million at february  and is based on of eligible credit card receivables and inventories less reserves  as defined in the credit agreement 
the amount available for borrowing represents the capped borrowing base of million reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
we did not use our revolving credit facility in or  other than for outstanding letters of credit 
we had no direct borrowings at february  impact of inflation although we expect that our operations will be influenced by general economic conditions  including rising food  fuel and energy prices  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by such factors in the future 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at february  in thousands total less than year years years after years operating leases capital leases purchase obligations a total a represent open purchase orders with vendors for merchandise not yet received and recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the above table does not include long term debt as we did not have any direct borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility at february  other long term liabilities on the balance sheet include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  deferred compensation  deferred rent liability  postretirement benefit liability and other long term liabilities that do not have specific due dates  so are excluded from the preceding table 
other long term liabilities also include long term store closing reserves  a component of which is future minimum payments under non cancelable leases for closed stores 
these future minimum lease payments for these closed stores total million and are included in the above table 
off balance sheet arrangements we have outstanding standby letters of credit totaling million securing certain insurance programs at february  if certain conditions were to occur under these arrangements  we would be required to satisfy the obligations in cash 
due to the nature of these arrangements and based on historical experience  we do not expect to make any payments  therefore  the letters of credit are excluded from the preceding table 
there are no other off balance sheet arrangements that could affect our financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require adjustments of these estimates in future periods 
a summary of the more significant accounting policies follows 
retail inventory method and inventory valuation 
inventories are valued using the lower of cost or market value  determined by the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the use of the retail inventory method results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant 
table of contents management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markon  markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the corresponding charge to cost of goods sold 
in addition  failure to take appropriate permanent markdowns currently can result in an overstatement of inventory 
we perform physical inventory counts at all stores annually 
included in the carrying value of merchandise inventories is a reserve for shrinkage 
shrinkage is estimated based on historical physical inventory results as a percentage of sales for the year 
the difference between actual and estimated amounts in any year may cause fluctuations in quarterly results  but is not a factor in full year results 
vendor allowances 
we receive allowances from some of our vendors primarily related to markdown reimbursement  damaged defective merchandise and vendor compliance issues 
vendor allowances are recorded when earned 
allowances received from vendors related to profitability of inventory recently sold are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold in the later of the period that the merchandise markdown is incurred or the allowance is negotiated 
allowances received from vendors related to damaged defective inventory are reflected as reductions to the cost of merchandise as it is received 
allowances received due to vendors failure to comply with our policies primarily violations of shipping and merchandise preparation requirements are reflected as a reduction of the cost of the merchandise when compliance issues are identified during the receiving process 
although it is unlikely that there will be a significant reduction in historical levels of vendor support  if a reduction were to occur  we could experience higher cost of merchandise sold 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors used in the review include management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows 
for long lived assets held for use  an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the assets is less than the carrying value of the assets 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value 
fair value  as used in our asset impairment calculations  is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
impairment reviews are performed for individual stores during the fourth quarter  or more frequently should circumstances change 
a significant change in cash flows could result in an increase in asset impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in asset impairment charges 
store closing costs 
we record costs associated with store closing activities when they are incurred  generally the cease use date 
lease termination costs are recorded net of estimated sublease income that could reasonably be obtained for the properties 
in the event we are not successful in subleasing closed store locations  additional store closing costs may be recorded 
during  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in store closing charges 
insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for various risks including workers compensation  general liability and associate related health care benefits 
we are responsible for paying the claims that are less than the insured limits 
the reserves recorded for these claims are actuarially estimated based on claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
these reserve estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims filed and settled 
the estimated accruals for these reserves could be significantly affected if future claims differ from historical trends and other actuarial assumptions 
as of february  and january   insurance reserves of million and million  respectively  were included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other liabilities 
historically  our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
income tax accounting guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
we perform a quarterly assessment of our net deferred tax assets to determine realization 
there was no valuation allowance required as of february  or january  as of january   the company had a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset which was released in income tax reserves 
we record liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to federal and state income taxes 
these liabilities reflect our best estimate of our ultimate income tax liability based on the tax code  regulations  and pronouncements of the jurisdictions in which we do business 
estimating our ultimate tax liability involves significant judgments regarding the application of complex tax regulations across many jurisdictions 
if actual results differ from estimated results  our effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended accounting standards codification asc topic  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires most entities to present changes in net income and other comprehensive income in either a single statement of comprehensive income or two separate  but consecutive  statements 
the objective of these amendments is to improve the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
we adopted this guidance in fiscal and have included the addition of the consolidated statements of comprehensive income in our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facility which are at variable rates 
the facility permits debt commitments up to million  which can be increased to million  has a february maturity date and bears interest at spreads over the prime rate and libor 
we had no borrowings under our revolving credit facility during  other than fees charged by the lender and outstanding letters of credit
