item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
overview we develop and manufacture a broad line of pre programmed universal remote control products  audio video accessories  and software that are marketed to enhance home entertainment systems 
our customers operate in the consumer electronics market and include subscription broadcasters  oems  international retailers  private labels  and companies in the computing industry 
we also sell integrated circuits  on which our software and ir code database  or library  is embedded  to oems that manufacture wireless control devices  cable converters or satellite receivers for resale in their products 
since our beginning in  we have compiled an extensive ir code library that covers over  individual device functions and approximately  individual consumer electronic equipment brand names 
our library is regularly updated with ir codes used in newly introduced av devices 
these ir codes are captured directly from the remote control devices or the manufacturer written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database 
we believe that our universal remote control library contains device codes that are capable of controlling virtually all ir controlled set top boxes  televisions  audio components  dvd players  and cd players  as well as most other infrared remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules worldwide 
we operate as one business segment 
we have twenty four subsidiaries located in argentina  cayman islands  france  germany  hong kong  india  italy  the netherlands  singapore  spain  brazil  british virgin islands  people republic of china and the united kingdom 
to recap our results for our net sales decreased to million for from million for our gross margin percentage improved from in to in this improvement was primarily due to an increase in units produced internally versus units produced by third party manufacturers in when compared to in addition  in the third quarter of  we received a lump sum payment related to a confidential settlement and license agreement with logitech 
this lump sum payment was recognized as revenue in the third quarter of see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note 
operating expenses  as a percent of sales  increased from in to in primarily due to an increase in research and development costs in an effort to continue to develop new technologies and products 
in addition  legal fees increased as a result of litigation efforts associated with protecting our patented technologies 
our operating income decreased to million for from million for our operating margin percentage of in was approximately flat compared to in our strategic business objectives for include the following continue to develop industry leading technologies and products with attractive gross margins in order to improve profitability  continue to increase our market share in new product categories  such as smart devices and game consoles  further penetrate the growing asian and latin american subscription broadcasting markets  acquire new customers in historically strong regions  increase our share with existing customers  and continue to seek acquisitions or strategic partners that complement and strengthen our existing business 
we intend for the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as how certain accounting principles  policies and estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
table of contents during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  warranties  inventory valuation  business combination purchase price allocations  our review for impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and compensation expense 
actual results may differ from these judgments and estimates  and they may be adjusted as more information becomes available 
any adjustment may be significant and may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably may have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may materially impact the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the accounting policies mentioned below  see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note for other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on the sale of products when title of the goods has transferred  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement such as a purchase order from the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns 
the provision recorded for estimated sales returns and allowances is deducted from gross sales to arrive at net sales in the period the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
the allowance for sales returns balance at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we accrue for discounts and rebates on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded based on our current expectations  after considering historical experience 
changes in such accruals may be required if future rebates and incentives differ from our estimates 
rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits 
rebates and incentives are recognized as cost of sales if we provide products or services for payment 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on a variety of factors  including credit reviews  historical experience  length of time receivables are past due  current economic trends and changes in customer payment behavior 
also  we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become aware of a customer inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer operating results or financial position 
our historical reserves have been sufficient to cover losses from uncollectible accounts 
however  because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we incurred million  million  and million of bad debt expense in   and  respectively 
we also license our intellectual property including our patented technologies  trademarks  and database of infrared codes 
when our license fees are paid on a per unit basis we record license revenue when our customers ship a product incorporating our intellectual property  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue for term license fees is recognized on a straight line basis over the effective term of the license when we cannot reliably predict in which periods  within the term of the license  the licensee will benefit from the use of our patented inventions 
warranty we warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship arising during normal use 
we service warranty claims directly through our customer service department or contracted third party warranty repair facilities 
our warranty periods range up to three years 
we estimate and recognize product warranty costs  which are included in cost of sales  as we sell the related products 
warranty costs are forecasted based on the best available information  primarily historical claims experience and the expected cost per claim 
the costs we have incurred to service warranty claims have been minimal 
however  actual claim costs may differ from the amounts estimated 
if a significant product defect were to be discovered on a high volume product  our financial statements may be materially impacted 

table of contents inventories our wireless remote control device  component part  and raw material inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for the estimated difference between cost and estimated market value based upon our best estimates of market conditions 
we carry inventory in amounts necessary to satisfy our customers inventory requirements on a timely basis 
we continually monitor our inventory status to control inventory levels and write down any excess or obsolete inventories on hand 
our total excess and obsolete inventory reserve on december  and was million and million  respectively  or and  respectively  of total inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which may have a material impact on our financial statements 
such circumstances may include  but are not limited to  the development of new competing technology that impedes the marketability of our products or the occurrence of significant price decreases in our raw material or component parts  such as integrated circuits 
each percentage point change in the ratio of excess and obsolete inventory reserve to inventory would impact cost of sales by approximately million 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets and the liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development ipr d  based upon their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant fair value estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management estimates the fair value of certain intangible assets by utilizing the following but not limited to future free cash flow from customer contracts  customer lists  distribution agreements  acquired developed technologies  trademarks  trade names and patents  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and cash flows from the products once they are completed  brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions regarding the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio  and discount rates utilized in discounted cash flow models 
our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  however  unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets we assess long lived and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important which may trigger an impairment review  if significant  include the following underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the assets  changes in the strategy of our overall business  negative industry or economic trends  a decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a variance between our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the carrying value of the asset is larger than its undiscounted cash flows  the asset is impaired 
the impairment is measured as the difference between the net book value of the asset and the asset estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated utilizing the assets projected discounted cash flows 
in assessing fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  the discount rate and other factors 
capitalized software development costs at each balance sheet date  we compare the unamortized capitalized software development costs to the net realizable value of the related product 
the amount by which the unamortized capitalized software development costs exceed the net realizable value of the related product is written off 
the net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues attributable to each product reduced by its estimated future completion and disposal costs 
any remaining amount of capitalized software 
table of contents development costs that have been written down are considered to be the cost for subsequent accounting purposes  and the amount of the write down is not subsequently restored 
goodwill we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill on december of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances may include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available  and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
we have a single reporting unit 
on december   we had goodwill of million 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we conduct a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
in the first step we compare the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit carrying amount  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit based on income and market approaches 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
under the market approach  we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of enterprise value to ebitda for comparable companies 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
to calculate the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is first allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the reporting unit fair value over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate market comparables 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in determining our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
income taxes we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them  which is in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions  respectively 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided us taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
the decision to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely outside the united states is based on our projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business may impact our effective tax rate 

table of contents we are subject to income taxes in the united states and foreign countries  and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
however  our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges in accordance with the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribed by us gaap 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgments and estimates 
we have recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  we believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate 
our reserve for uncertain tax positions is primarily attributable to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations  including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions  and any related interest 
we review our reserves quarterly  and we may adjust such reserves due to proposed assessments by tax authorities  changes in facts and circumstances  issuance of new regulations or new case law  previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination  negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices  execution of advanced pricing agreements  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  the resolution of entire audits  or the expiration of statutes of limitations 
the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits may be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and  therefore  may have a material impact on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
stock based compensation we recognize the grant date fair value of stock based compensation awards as expense  net of estimated forfeitures  in proportion to vesting during the requisite service period  which ranges from one to four years 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock awards utilizing the average of the high and low trade prices of our company shares on the date they were granted 
we have evaluated the available option pricing models and the assumptions we may utilize to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
we have elected to utilize the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions utilized in the black scholes model include risk free interest rate  expected volatility  and expected life in years 
our risk free interest rate over the expected term is equal to the prevailing us treasury note rate over the same period 
as part of our assessment of possible expected volatility assumptions  management determined that historical volatility calculated based on our actively traded common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than implied volatility 
therefore  we calculate the expected volatility of our common stock utilizing its historical volatility over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock option 
to determine our expected life assumption  we examined the historical pattern of stock option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernible patterns based on employee classification 
from this analysis  we identified two classifications executives and board of directors and non executives 
our estimate of expected life is computed utilizing historical exercise patterns and post vesting behavior within each of the two identified classifications 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure regarding stock based compensation 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income the comparability of information for and compared to is affected by the acquisition of enson during the fourth quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for were million  a decrease of compared to million in net income for was million or per diluted share compared to million or per diluted share in millions of total millions of total net sales business consumer total net sales net sales in our business lines subscription broadcasting  oem  and computing companies were of net sales in compared to in net sales in our business lines in decreased by to million from million in the prolonged sluggish global economy has had an adverse effect on television sales  which  in turn  directly affects our sales to consumer electronics companies 
partially offsetting the decrease in sales to consumer electronics companies is an increase in net sales within subscription broadcasting 
net sales in subscription broadcasting have remained strong in north america and have grown significantly  on a percentage basis  in latin america  specifically brazil 
net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail and private label were of net sales in compared to in net sales in our consumer lines in increased by to million from million in international retail sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased sales in the uk and latin america 
in addition  north american retail sales increased million  from million to million 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million compared to million in gross profit as a percent of sales increased to in from in this improvement is primarily due to an increase in units produced internally versus units produced by third party manufacturers 
gross profit in was also positively affected by us entering into a licensing agreement with a customer in the gaming industry  as well as the signing of a long term  confidential settlement and license agreement with logitech 
compared to  this favorability was partially offset by pricing pressure from customers 
research and development r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in the increase is due to additional labor dedicated to general r d activities in an effort to continue to develop new products and technologies 

table of contents selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in legal expenses increased by million as a result of litigation costs related to protecting our intellectual property 
employee bonus expense increased by million 
partially offsetting these expense increases was a million favorable currency effect due primarily to the euro weakening compared to the us dollar 
interest income expense  net 
net interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to lower credit needs during  primarily as a result of positive operating cash flows which allowed for the paydown of debt associated with the acquisition of enson 
other income expense  net 
net other expense was million in compared to net other expense of million in this increase was driven by a higher amount of foreign currency losses in  driven by fluctuations in the foreign currency rates relating to the argentinian peso  brazilian real  chinese yuan renminbi and euro 
income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in and our effective tax rate was in compared to in the increase in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a million million net of federal benefit valuation allowance that we recorded in against our deferred tax assets related to california research and experimentation credits 
at december   we believed it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized 
in addition  as the result of a tax law change in china  approximately million of deferred tax assets were no longer valid resulting in their write down 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales

this was primarily due to the increase of sales to the latin america subscription broadcasting market and the acquisition of new domestic customers in our business category during net sales in our consumer lines one for all retail  private label  custom installers  and direct import were of net sales in compared to in net sales in our consumer lines in decreased by to million from million in net sales in north american retail decreased by million  or  from million in to million in in addition  our custom installer sales decreased by million  from million in to million in partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in international retail sales  from million in to million in the net sales in our consumer lines were positively impacted by the strengthening of the euro and the british pound compared to the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in net sales of approximately million 
net of the favorable currency effect  international retail sales increased by million due primarily to the analog to digital transition that took place in some european countries 
gross profit 
gross profit in was million compared to million in gross profit as a percent of sales decreased to in from in  due primarily to our sales mix  as a higher percentage of our total sales was comprised of our lower margin business category 
this shift in sales composition was expected as a result of our acquisition of enson  which sells exclusively within the business category 
in addition  during  customers gravitated more towards our lower margin products which put downward pressure on our gross margin percentage 
research and development expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to additional labor dedicated to general research development activities in an effort to continue to develop new technologies and products 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the strengthening of the euro compared to the us dollar resulted in an increase of million 
excluding the currency effect  sg a expenses increased by million  primarily due to an increase of million of operating expenses from enson  which included an increase of million of intangible asset amortization during in addition  total wages increased by million and our newly established operating entity in brazil increased operating expenses by million 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in bonus expense of million 
interest income expense  net 
we incurred million of net interest expense in compared to thousand of net interest income in the increase in interest expense was due to drawing on our line of credit during other income expense  net 
net other expense was million in compared to net other income of million in the expense in was driven by foreign currency losses of million whereas we experienced million in foreign currency gains in income tax expense 
income tax expense was million in compared to million in  and our effective tax rate was in compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate was due primarily to a higher percentage of income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions  the statute of limitations expiring during on certain tax positions recorded in the united states  and lower interest expense resulting from fewer uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash in thousands year ended december  increase decrease year ended december  increase decrease year ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used for investing activities cash used for provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash december  increase decrease december  cash and cash equivalents working capital net cash provided by operating activities increased million in when compared to  driven largely by a million improvement in cash flows associated with inventories 
in  there were two items that resulted in a permanent increase to our inventory levels 
first  as a result of labor issues we previously experienced resulting from the chinese new year  as well as the fact that both of our factories located in china shut down for a week during the chinese new year holiday period  we made a conscious effort to increase our inventory levels during the latter half of the year in order to prevent supply issues 
second  in the second quarter of  we altered our shipping terms with a significant customer that resulted in us holding title to inventories until shipments are received by this particular customer 
the aforementioned items had an adverse effect on cash flows in  however  for  the higher inventory levels were already in the base year 
working capital changes in also included a million increase in cash flows related to accounts payable and accrued expenses that was due primarily to payment timing related to fourth quarter inventory purchases and increased incentive compensation accruals  offset by a million decrease in cash flows associated with accounts receivable that was driven primarily by year end collection timing 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million during cash flows decreased by million during due to increased inventories 
in the second quarter of  we altered our shipping terms with a significant customer that results in us holding title to inventories until the shipments are received by this particular customer 
we also increased our investment in safety stock on certain products as a result of the timing of the chinese new year 
in addition  cash inflows related to accounts receivable decreased million  from million in to million in due primarily to net sales increasing from million in the fourth quarter of to million in the fourth quarter partially offsetting these decreases to cash flow from operations was an increase to net income of 
table of contents million and an increase in depreciation and amortization of million 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was a direct result of the acquisition of enson assets limited 
net cash used for investing activities during was million compared to million and million of net cash used during and  respectively 
during and  cash used for investing activities consisted of our investments in property  plant  and equipment as well as internally developed patents 
during  our million time deposit investment matured  which was initially entered into during the cash proceeds from the time deposit were used to purchase enson during  which amounted to a million cash outflow net of cash acquired 
please refer to item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements notes and for additional disclosure regarding our acquisition of enson 
net cash used for financing activities was million during compared to net cash used for financing activities of million during and net cash provided by financing activities of million during during  we made net debt payments of million compared to million in in  we issued million of debt in order to fund the acquisition of enson  of which we repaid million by december  proceeds from stock option exercises were million during compared to proceeds of million and million during and  respectively 
in addition  we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million during  compared to  and  shares at a cost of million and million during and  respectively 
we hold these shares as treasury stock and they are available for reissue 
presently  except for using a minimal number of these treasury shares to compensate our outside board members  we have no plans to distribute these shares  although we may change these plans if necessary to fulfill our on going business objectives 
from time to time  our board of directors authorizes management to repurchase shares of our issued and outstanding common stock 
repurchases may be made to manage dilution created by shares issued under our stock incentive plans or whenever we deem a repurchase is a good use of our cash and the price to be paid is at or below a threshold approved by our board 
as of december   we had  shares available for repurchase under the board authorizations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations primarily include contractual payments to purchase tooling assets and inventory 
liquidity historically  we have utilized cash provided from operations as our primary source of liquidity  as internally generated cash flows have been sufficient to support our business operations  capital expenditures and discretionary share repurchases 
our working capital needs have typically been greatest during the third and fourth quarters when accounts receivable and inventories increase in connection with the fourth quarter holiday selling season 
we believe our current cash balances and anticipated cash flow to be generated from operations will be sufficient to cover cash outlays expected during  however  because our cash is located in various jurisdictions throughout the world  we may at times need to borrow from our revolving line of credit until we are able to transfer cash among our various entities 
our liquidity is subject to various risks including the market risks identified in the section entitled qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in item a 

table of contents on december  cash and cash equivalents total debt available borrowing resources our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world 
the majority of our cash is held outside of the united states and may be repatriated to the united states but  under current law  would be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
we have not provided for the united states federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes as this cash is considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
our intent is to meet our domestic liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
we utilize a variety of tax planning strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
on december   we had million  million  million and million of cash and cash equivalents in the united states  asia  europe  and south america  respectively 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to liquidity  credit and other relevant risks by placing our cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions we believe are high quality 
on october   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement amended credit agreement with us bank national association us bank 
under the amended credit agreement  the existing secured revolving credit line credit line was increased from million to million and the expiration date was extended from november  to november  the amended credit agreement required that the credit line be used to pay off the remaining outstanding balance of the existing term loan with us bank 
the credit line may be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes including acquisitions  share repurchases and capital expenditures 
amounts available for borrowing under the credit line are reduced by the balance of any outstanding letters of credit  of which there were none at december  all obligations under the credit line are secured by substantially all of our us personal property and tangible and intangible assets as well as of our ownership interest in enson assets limited  our wholly owned subsidiary which controls our manufacturing factories in the prc 
under the amended credit agreement  we may elect to pay interest on the credit line based on libor plus an applicable margin varying from to or base rate based on the prime rate of us bank or as otherwise specified in the amended credit agreement plus an applicable margin varying from to 
the applicable margins are calculated quarterly and vary based on our leverage ratio as set forth in the amended credit agreement 
there are no commitment fees or unused line fees under the amended credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement includes financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio and minimum liquidity levels 
in addition  the amended credit agreement also contains other customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the amended credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements see item financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of these risks and the use of financial instruments to mitigate our risk exposure 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt 
although at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  from time to time we need to borrow amounts for working capital and other liquidity needs 

table of contents under the amended credit agreement that became effective on october   we may elect to pay interest on outstanding borrowings on our credit line based on libor or a base rate based on the prime rate of us bank plus an applicable margin as defined in the amended credit agreement 
a basis point increase in interest rates would have had an insignificant effect on reported net income for the year ended december  we cannot make any assurances that we will not need to borrow additional amounts in the future or that funds will be extended to us under comparable terms or at all 
if funding is not available to us at a time when we need to borrow  we would have to use our cash reserves  including potentially repatriating cash from foreign jurisdictions  which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial position and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk at december  we had wholly owned subsidiaries in argentina  brazil  cayman islands  france  germany  hong kong  india  italy  the netherlands  the prc  singapore  spain  and the united kingdom 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases  assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the most significant foreign currencies to our operations during were the euro  british pound  chinese yuan renminbi  indian rupee  singapore dollar  argentinian peso and brazilian real 
for most currencies  we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to the foreign currency 
even where we are a net receiver  a weaker us dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange agreements to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted income and cash flows denominated in foreign currencies 
the terms of these foreign currency exchange agreements normally last less than nine months 
we recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency denominated exposures 
it is difficult to estimate the impact of fluctuations on reported income  as it depends on the opening and closing rates  the average net balance sheet positions held in a foreign currency and the amount of income generated in local currency 
we routinely forecast what these balance sheet positions and income generated in local currency may be and we take steps to minimize exposure as we deem appropriate 
alternatively  we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures  primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge 
we do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the sensitivity of earnings and cash flows to the variability in exchange rates is assessed by applying an approximate range of potential rate fluctuations to our assets  obligations and projected results of operations denominated in foreign currency with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures 
based on our overall foreign currency rate exposure at december   we believe that movements in foreign currency rates may have a material effect on our financial position 
we estimate that if the exchange rates for the euro  british pound  chinese yuan renminbi  indian rupee  singapore dollar  argentinian peso  and the brazilian real relative to the us dollar fluctuate from december   net income and total cash flows in the first quarter of would fluctuate by approximately million and million  respectively
