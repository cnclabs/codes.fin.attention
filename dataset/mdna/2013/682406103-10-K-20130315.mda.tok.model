item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust 
we acquire  own and manage a geographically diversified portfolio of retail  industrial  health and fitness  office  flex and other properties  a substantial portion of which are leased under long term net leases 
as of december   we owned properties and our joint ventures owned seven properties 
the properties are located in states 
we face a variety of risks and challenges in our business 
as more fully described under item a risk factors  we  among other things  face the possibility we will not be able to acquire accretive properties on acceptable terms  lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all and that our tenants may not be able to pay their rental and other obligations 
we seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio by diversifying among types of properties and industries  locations  tenants and scheduled lease expirations 
as a result    and of our contractual rental income is derived from retail  industrial  health and fitness  office  and other properties  respectively  only one tenant accounts for or more of our contractual rental income  properties in only two states account for more than of contractual rental income excluding the effect of properties leased to a single tenant but located in multiple states ie  haverty furniture and pantry pride  and through  there is only one year in which the percentage of our contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds of our contractual rental income and approximately of our contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in and thereafter 
we monitor the risk of tenant non payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation 
generally  based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants  we monitor a tenant financial condition through one or more of the following actions reviewing tenant financial statements  obtaining other tenant related financial information  regular contact with tenant representatives  tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants 
in acquiring properties  we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired  which analysis takes into account  among other things  the estimated value of the property  local demographics and the ability to re rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination 
summary of results in  our net income increased to million from million in the increase is due primarily to an increase in income from discontinued operations and  to a lesser extent  an increase in income from continuing operations 
income from discontinued operations increased in to million from million in the increase in income from discontinued operations is attributable to the gain of million from the sale in of five properties 
income from continuing operations increased to million from million in contributing to the increase were increases in  among other things  rental revenues  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures and gain on sale of real estate 
partially offsetting the increase were increases in depreciation and amortization expense  real estate acquisition expense and federal excise and state taxes and the inclusion in of a million gain on settlement of debt 

table of contents highlights and recent developments in  we purchased eleven properties with contractual rental income of approximately million for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  sold five properties  for an aggregate of million and a net gain of million 
the properties sold accounted for million of income from operations of discontinued operations in  refinanced the approximately million of mortgage debt secured by the eleven properties leased to haverty furniture and bearing interest of per year 
the new mortgage debt  in the aggregate principal amount of million  matures september  subject to the lender option to call the debt for any reason on days notice at any time after september  and bears interest of per year  and amended our credit facility to  among other things  reduce our interest rate floor from to  increase our permitted borrowings from million to million and extend the facility maturity from march  to march  as of december  and march   no borrowings were outstanding under the facility 
in the first quarter of  we elected not to participate in the redevelopment plan proposed by our joint venture partner in the plano property  and thereafter  our partner exercised its right to purchase our interest in the venture for approximately million 
we anticipate that this transaction will be completed in results of operations comparison of years ended december  and total revenues the following table compares revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change total revenues total revenues 
the increase is attributable to rental revenues of million earned from properties acquired by us beginning march of which million is attributable to properties acquired in  and  of real estate tax and expense reimbursements from tenants primarily from properties we acquired since july

general and administrative expenses 
contributing to the increase were increases of approximately i  in payroll and payroll related expenses due to higher levels of compensation and to a lesser extent  additional employees and ii  in non cash compensation expense related to restricted stock awards due to the increase in the number of awards granted  the higher fair value of such awards at the time of grant and changes in assumptions relating to restricted stock units

interest expense 
the following table summarizes interest expense for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change interest expense credit line interest mortgage interest total credit line interest the decrease is due to the million  or  reduction in the weighted average balance outstanding under our line of credit 
in february  we applied million of our public offering proceeds to reduce the then outstanding balance on our credit line

amortization of deferred financing costs 
the increase is due to  incurred in connection with financings on four properties we acquired in   incurred in connection with the amendment of our line of credit in january and  due to the accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs relating to two mortgage loans that were paid in full in february discontinued operations the following table compares discontinued operations for the periods indicated year ended december  increase decrease dollars in thousands change discontinued operations income from operations net gain on sales income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations includes the i results of operations and the gain on sale of three of our properties  one of which was sold during and two of which were sold in and ii the results of operations of five properties sold in liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital include cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  refinancing existing mortgage loans  obtaining mortgage loans secured by our unencumbered properties  issuance of our equity securities and property sales 
our available liquidity at march  was approximately million  including approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving line of credit including the million required deposit balance 
liquidity and financing we expect to meet substantially all of our operating cash requirements including dividend payments from cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not 
table of contents adequate to cover all of our operating needs  we will be required to use our available cash and cash equivalents or draw on our credit line to the extent permitted to satisfy operating requirements 
mortgage debt in aggregate principal amount of million inclusive of million of debt amortization payments is payable from january  through december  ie  million in  million in and million in 
we intend to make debt amortization payments from operating cash flow and  though no assurance can be given that we will be successful in this regard  generally intend to refinance or extend the mortgage loans which mature in through we intend to repay the amounts not refinanced or extended from our existing funds and sources of funds  including our available cash and our credit line to the extent available 
we continually seek to refinance existing mortgage loans on terms we deem acceptable  in order to generate additional liquidity 
additionally  in the normal course of our business  we sell properties when we determine that it is in our best interests  which also generates additional liquidity 
further  since each of our encumbered properties is subject to a non recourse mortgage with standard carve outs  if our in house evaluation of the market value of such property is substantially less than the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage loan  we may determine to convey such property to the mortgagee in order to terminate our mortgage obligations  including payment of interest  principal and real estate taxes  with respect to such property 
typically  we utilize funds from our credit facility to acquire a property and  thereafter secure long term  fixed rate mortgage debt on such property 
we apply the proceeds from the mortgage loan to repay borrowings under the credit facility  thus providing us with the ability to re borrow under the credit facility for the acquisition of additional properties 
as a result  in order to grow our business  it is important to have a credit facility in place 
credit facility we can borrow up to million pursuant to our revolving credit facility which is available to us for the acquisition of commercial real estate  repayment of mortgage debt  property improvements and general working capital purposes  provided  that if used for property improvements and working capital purposes  such use will not exceed the lesser of million and of the borrowing base and if used for working capital purposes  will not exceed million 
the facility matures on march  and bears interest at the greater of i day libor plus and ii 
there is an unused facility fee of per annum on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and million 
we are required to maintain at least million in average deposit balances 
the terms of our revolving credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit  among other things  the incurrence of liens  and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to  among other things  the minimum amount of tangible net worth  the minimum amount of debt service coverage  the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage  the maximum amount of debt to value  the minimum level of net income  certain investment limitations and the minimum value of unencumbered properties and the number of such properties 
net proceeds received from the sale  financing or refinancing of properties are generally required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under this facility 

table of contents contractual obligations the following sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations mortgages payable interest and amortization mortgages payable balances due at maturity credit facility purchase obligations total assumes that the interest rate on the million variable rate mortgage debt per annum maturing in is fixed in november at per annum with a year amortization schedule 
there was no balance outstanding as of december  we may borrow up to million under such facility 
includes million payable annually pursuant to the compensation and services agreement at the rate in effect at december  and assuming such agreement continues for only five years  amounts payable for office space leased from a related party and amounts payable pursuant to a ground lease 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that mortgage interest and amortization payments excluding repayments of principal at maturity of approximately million due through will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that debt obligations due through of approximately million will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and refinancings 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all debt obligations when payments become due  and we may need to issue additional equity  obtain long or short term debt  or dispose of properties on unfavorable terms 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders pursuant to internal revenue procedures 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 

table of contents it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
our board of directors reviews the dividend policy regularly to determine if any changes to our dividend should be made

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these critical accounting policies include the following  discussed below 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management determination of relative fair values of these assets 
we assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information 
the fair values associated with below market rental renewal options are determined based on our experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions 
the portion of the values of the leases associated with below market renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant payment history and the financial condition of the tenant 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we are required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which has an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken  and will decrease total assets and stockholders equity 

table of contents carrying value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment to the carrying value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the current financial statements or other available financial information of the tenant  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  if the undiscounted cash flow analysis yields an amount which is less than the asset carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value is less than the asset carrying amount 
the estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge  but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
these swaps are used for hedging purposes not for speculation 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
at december   we had eight interest rate swap agreements outstanding including one held by two of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
the fair market value of the interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there had been an increase of basis points in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have increased by approximately million 
if there were a decrease of basis points in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have decreased by approximately million 
these changes would not have any impact on our net income or cash 
our mortgage debt  after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements and excluding a million mortgage maturing in  bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
as of december   if there had been an increase of basis points on the million mortgage debt  interest expense would have increased by approximately  and a decrease of basis points would have decreased interest expense by approximately  our credit facility is a revolving variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
we assessed the market risk for our revolving credit facility and believe that there is no foreseeable market risk because interest is charged at the greater of i day libor 
table of contents plus and ii per annum 
at december   day libor plus was approximately  therefore  an increase or decrease of basis points on this interest rate would not have any impact on our interest expense related to this facility 
the fair market value of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value at december  for the year ended december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair market value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt includes the million variable rate mortgage debt maturing in and assumes that effective november  the interest rate is fixed at per annum and such debt provides for principal payments on a year amortization schedule 
our credit facility matures on march  and bears interest at the greater of i and ii day libor plus
