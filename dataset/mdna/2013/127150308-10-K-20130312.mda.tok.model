net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non comparable stores  as well as credit card activation fees and sales royalties 
a store is not included in comparable store sales until the first day of the fiscal month following the twelfth full month of sales 
non comparable store sales include sales generated at new stores prior to the period when they are considered comparable stores and sales generated from stores that we have since closed 
comparable stores sales percentages shown in the chart above are calculated based upon the number of weeks in the respective fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  located elsewhere in this document 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies and estimates which are described below 
inventories 
our finished goods inventories at our retail stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
we take markdowns due to changes in fashion and style  based on the following factors i supply on hand  ii historical experience and iii our expectations as to future sales 
we do not anticipate any significant change in our markdown strategy that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
we believe that our rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
inventories other than finished goods at retail stores  called production inventory  primarily consists of piece goods  trim and work in process 
the company values production inventory at the lower of cost or market value using first in first out valuation method 
the company reviews the inventory for factors such as age  obsolescence  potential use  or other factors that may indicate a decline in its value 
the company records a reserve against the cost of the production inventory to account for any decline in its value 
finite long lived assets 
the company judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and exceeds the fair market value 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  
table of contents significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or underperforming business trends 
the company evaluates finite lived assets in accordance with impairment or disposal of long lived assets under topic property  plant and equipment of the financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc 
finite lived assets are evaluated for recoverability in accordance with topic of the fasb asc whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  the company estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss  equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair market value of the asset is recognized 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
the company evaluated its finite lived assets during fiscal  and and  as a result  recorded an impairment charge of million for underperforming stores   for underperforming stores and  for underperforming stores  respectively 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of various trade names associated with the cache name 
the company evaluates its intangible assets in accordance with intangibles goodwill and other  topic of the fasb asc 
during fiscal  the company performed impairment testing  which considered the company fair value to determine whether an impairment charge related to the carrying value of the company recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its adrienne victoria reporting unit was necessary 
the company considered many factors in evaluating whether the carrying value of the recorded goodwill was recoverable 
factors used to determine this primarily include declines in stock price and the market capitalization in relation to the book value of the company  discounted projected cash flows of the reporting unit and valuation of companies comparable to the reporting unit 
as a result of this testing  an impairment charge of million was recorded against the remaining carrying value of goodwill during fiscal self insurance 
we are self insured for losses and liabilities related primarily to employee health and welfare claims up to certain thresholds 
losses are accrued based upon our estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based on company experience 
adjustments to earnings resulting from changes in historical loss trends were not significant for fiscal and the company earnings were impacted by an increase in employee health and welfare claims of  for fiscal  as compared with fiscal we maintain stop loss insurance coverage which covers us for benefits paid in excess of limits as defined in the plan 
therefore we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in earnings

the company is recognizing the estimated 
table of contents unredeemed merchandise credits and gift cards over a fourteen quarter period with recognized in the first quarter to in the fourteenth quarter subsequent to the issue date 
the company has determined that redemption would be remote based on the fact that  by the fourteenth quarter since issue date  the redemption rate approximated  indicating that the probability of such merchandise credits and gift cards being redeemed is remote

this guidance requires the company to recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  using applicable tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
at december   the company maintained million of net deferred tax assets  of which approximately million related to federal tax operating loss carry forwards and million

as of december  and december   the company had no reserve recorded for tax contingencies 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based awards programs  including grants of stock options  is recorded in accordance with compensation stock compensation  topic of the fasb asc

all employee stock options were granted at or above the grant date market price
