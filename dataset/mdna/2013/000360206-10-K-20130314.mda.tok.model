item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we engineer  manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of rooftop units  chillers  air handling units  make up air units  heat recovery units  condensing units  commercial self contained units and coils 
these products are marketed and sold to retail  manufacturing  educational  medical and other commercial industries 
we market our products to all states in the united states and certain provinces in canada 
foreign sales were approximately of our sales 
our business can be affected by a number of economic factors  including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate 
the recent state of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets 
a further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability 
sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built  which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates  inflation  consumer spending habits  employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control 
we sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers representatives and our internal sales force 
the demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors 
the commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts  but has a lag factor of months 
housing starts  in turn  are affected by such factors as interest rates  the state of the economy  population growth and the relative age of the population 
when new construction is down  we emphasize the replacement market 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are labor  raw materials  component costs  factory overhead  freight and engineering expense 
the principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel  copper and aluminum and are obtained from domestic suppliers 
we also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components  including compressors  motors and electrical controls 
the price levels of our raw materials have moderated from the high prices we experienced a year ago  but the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the us economy  a weakening global economy  and november s presidential election 
for the year ended december   the price for copper increased by approximately and the cost for steel and aluminum decreased approximately and respectively  from a year ago 
for the year ended december  prices for copper and steel increased approximately and  respectively from prior year  while the cost of aluminum decreased approximately 
we attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancelable and non cancelable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of to months 
we expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  from time to time we use derivative contracts to partially mitigate the volatility in the prices for some of these commodities 
we did not enter into a derivative contract for any of our key raw materials during the years ended december  and the following are key highlights and events that impacted our results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition in net sales for were million  the highest in the company s history  compared to million in the increase in net sales can be attributed to gains in market share in the non residential and replacement markets along with price increases introduced earlier in the year 
we estimate that we have captured approximately share of the rooftop market and a share of the coil market 
approximately of our sales were generated from the sale to the renovation and replacement markets and from new construction markets 
income from operations was million compared to million in the increase in operational income can be attributed to higher sales and improved productivity during the year 
net income for was million  up by million  compared to million in we paid million in capital expenditures  a decrease of million from we paid cash dividends of million in compared to million in the dividends included a one time special dividend of  in addition to the regular semi annual dividend of  declared by the board on november   due to our strong financial position

liquidity and capital resources our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time 
general on july  we renewed the line of credit with the bank of oklahoma  national association 
the revolving line of credit matures on july  we expect to renew our line of credit in july with favorable terms as we do not anticipate a tightening of funds in the financial markets 
under the line of credit  there is one standby letter of credit of million 
at december  we have approximately million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility 
no fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount 
as of december   there was no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and million borrowings were outstanding at december  interest on borrowings is payable monthly at libor plus

at december  we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility 
these covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our tangible net worth  total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio and working capital 
at december  our tangible net worth was million  which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was to which meets the requirement of not being above to our working capital was million  which meets the requirement of being at or above million 
we repurchased shares of stock under our authorized stock buyback programs  employees k savings  investment plan  and from option exercises of our directors and officers in the open market in the amount of million for million shares  million for million shares and million for approximately million shares of stock in  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   and we paid cash dividends of million  million  and million respectively 
based on historical performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance  the projected cash flows generated from our operations  our existing committed revolving credit facility or comparable financing and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in and the foreseeable future 
statement of cash flows the table below reflects a summary of our net cash flows provided by operating activities  net cash flows used in investing activities  and net cash flows used in financing activities for the years indicated 
in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in this increase was due to higher net income and a favorable change in working capital 
for the year ended december   net income increased by million 
for  net income decreased by million from significant fluctuations in working capital were as follows inventory less cash was used in as we experienced decreases in raw materials prices from the prior year end 
overall  inventories decreased million to million at december  compared to million the previous year 
more cash was used in as improved demand resulted in increased volume and higher prices for raw materials  component  and parts in our inventory balance as compared to resulting in decreased cash flows of million 
accounts receivable increased by approximately million from the prior year primarily as a result of increased sales 
in  we experienced improved collection rates as a result of targeted sales discounts for some of our selected customers 
this resulted in a decrease in our accounts receivable balance of approximately million from accrued liabilities accrued liabilities increased cash flows by approximately million due to an increase in customer product pre payments and credits of approximately million  an increase in payroll and employee benefit accruals of approximately million and an increase in the accrual of amounts due to our representatives of approximately million 
accrued liabilities decreased cash flows by approximately million in due to changes in certain reserves estimates as a result of better and improved experience and a decreased in amounts due to our representatives offset by a slight increase in accrued payroll and employee benefits

net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared with million in the change in investing activities is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from investments in that were offset by a net increase in capital expenditures during capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in were primarily investments in our manufacturing and production equipment to support our growth and improve efficiencies with equipment which combines the latest advancement in automation and laser technology 
the capital expenditure program for is estimated to be approximately million 
many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our ceo and board of directors without incurring substantial charges 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  compared with million during the change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately million of share repurchases as well as dividend payments of million  and reduced borrowings and increased payments on our credit facility resulting in no outstanding borrowings at december  net cash used in financing activities during the year ended december  was million  compared with million during the change in financing activities is primarily related to approximately million of share repurchases as well as dividend payments of million  partially offset by an increase in net borrowing of approximately million and stock options and restricted stock awards exercised 
off balance sheet arrangements we are not party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
commitments and contractual agreements we have no material contractual agreements as of december  contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we closely monitor these claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may  when resolved  have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
while we are unable to estimate the ultimate dollar amount of exposure or loss in connection with these matters  we make accruals as warranted 
we believe that we have adequately provided in our consolidated financial statements for the potential impact of these contingencies 
we also believe that the outcomes will not significantly affect the long term results of operations  our financial position or our cash flows 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions  and such differences could be material 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from sales of products when the products are shipped and the title and risk of ownership pass to the customer 
final sales prices are fixed and based on purchase orders 
sales allowances and customer incentives are treated as reductions to sales and are provided for based on historical experiences and current estimates 
in addition  the company presents revenues net of sales tax and net of certain payments to our independent manufacturer representatives representatives 
representatives are national companies that are in the business of providing hvac units and other related products and services to customers 
the end user customer orders a bundled group of products and services from the representative and expects the representative to fulfill the order 
only after the specifications are agreed to by the representative and the customer  and the decision is made to use an aaon hvac unit  will we receive notice of the order 
we establish the amount we must receive for our hvac unit minimum sales price  but do not control the total order price which is negotiated by the representative with the end user customer 
we are responsible for billings and collections resulting from all sales transactions  including those initiated by our representatives 
the representatives submit the total order price to us for invoicing and collection 
the total order price includes our minimum sales price and an additional amount which may include both the representatives fee and amounts due for additional products and services required by the customer 
these additional products and services may include controls purchased from another manufacturer to operate the unit  start up services  and curbs for supporting the unit third party products 
all are associated with the purchase of a hvac unit but may be provided by the representative or another third party 
the company is under no obligation related to third party products 
the representatives do not provide us with a break out of the amount of the total order price over the minimum sales price which includes the representatives fee and third party product amounts due to representatives 
the due to representatives amount is paid only after all amounts associated with the order are collected from the customer 
the amount of payments to our representatives was million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated to cover the risk of loss related to accounts receivable 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends in collections and write offs  current customer status  the age of the receivable  economic conditions and other information 
aged receivables are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if the reserve is adequate and adjusted accordingly at that time 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective judgments 
thus  changes in these factors or changes in economic circumstances may significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
inventory reserves we establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes  the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions  the required parts needed for part supply sales  replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage 
warranty a provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized 
the warranty period is the earlier of one year from the date of first use or months from date of shipment for parts only  an additional four years on compressors if applicable  years on aluminized steel gas fired heat exchangers if applicable  years on stainless steel heat exchangers if applicable  and years on gas fired heat exchangers in rl products if applicable 
with the introduction of the rq product line in  our warranty policy for the rq series was implemented to cover parts for two years from date of unit shipment and labor for one year from date of unit shipment 
warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period  historical warranty trends and associated costs  and any known identifiable warranty issue 
due to the absence of warranty history on new products  an additional provision may be made for such products 
our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience 
should actual claim rates differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required 
medical insurance a provision is made for medical costs associated with our medical employee benefit plan  which is primarily a self funded plan 
a provision is made for estimated medical costs based on historical claims paid and potential significant future claims 
the plan is supplemented by employee contributions and any claim over  is covered by insurance 
stock compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock awards  based on their fair values at the time of grant 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized on a straight line basis during the service period of the related share based compensation award 
forfeitures are estimated based on the company historical experience 
the fair value of each option award and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions such as the expected volatility  the expected term of the options granted  expected dividend yield  and the risk free rate 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 presentation of comprehensive income and the update to this standard was issued december this standard eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
the amendment requires that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in the two statement approach  the first statement should present total net income and its components followed consecutively by a second statement that should present total other comprehensive income  the components of other comprehensive income  and the total of comprehensive income 
the amendment must be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  primarily from commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  occasionally we use financial derivatives to economically hedge our commodity price risk 
we do not use financial derivatives for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our revolving credit facility  which bears a variable interest rate of libor plus 
at december  we had no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
commodity price risk we are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and occasionally we use fixed price cancellable and non cancellable contracts with our major suppliers for periods of to months to manage this exposure 
from time to time we use financial derivatives to economically hedge our commodity price risk 
we do not have committed commodity derivative instruments in place at december
