our business strategy also involves assessing our portfolio of products with a view of divesting non core product lines that do not align with our objectives 
history of our business we were incorporated in delaware on january  for the purpose of holding the clinical and medical products businesses of cardinal health  inc cardinal health in anticipation of spinning off from cardinal health 
we completed the spinoff from cardinal health on august  our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by cardinal health of established healthcare companies  including the acquisition in of viasys healthcare inc viasys  a developer of respiratory care systems  and the acquisition in of the assets of enturia  inc enturia  a manufacturer of skin antiseptic products 
since the spinoff  we have taken steps to expand and refine our product offerings  including through the acquisitions and divestitures described below 

table of contents acquisitions date business may medegen  a manufacturer of clinically differentiated iv needleless access valves and administration sets  including our maxguard and maxplus products april vestara  a developer of technology solutions that enable the safe  efficient disposal and tracking of environmentally sensitive pharmaceutical waste august rowa  a german based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies april phacts  a technology and consulting company that helps hospital pharmacies better manage inventory  reduce pharmaceutical costs  and streamline operations june uk medical holdings  a leading distributor of specialized medical products to the national health service and private healthcare sector in the united kingdom november intermed  a leading respiratory technologies company based in brazil divestitures date business october audiology  a manufacturer and marketer of hearing diagnostic equipment may research services  a clinical trial service provider to pharmaceutical firms march onsite services  a surgical instrument management and repair service provider april international surgical products  a distributor of medical supplies and surgical products outside the united states july nicolet  a manufacturer of neurodiagnostic monitoring equipment the results of our audiology business  our international surgical products business  and our nicolet business are reflected in discontinued operations in the financial information included throughout this annual report on form k 
business segments leading up to our spinoff from cardinal health  we organized our businesses into two reportable segments critical care technologies and medical technologies and services 
during the quarter ended september   we realigned our businesses into two new global operating and reportable segments  medical systems and procedural solutions  in order to reduce complexity  provide clearer governance for our investments and make it easier for our customers to do business with us 
additionally  during the quarter ended september   we combined our respiratory diagnostics products with the respiratory technologies business line within the medical systems segment 
our respiratory diagnostics products had previously been reported within the procedural solutions segment as other 
our historical financial information for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect these changes to our operating and reportable segments 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements for certain segment financial data relating to our business 
the following business discussion is based on our two segments as they were structured for fiscal year medical systems segment the medical systems segment is organized around our medical equipment business lines 
in our medical systems segment  we develop  manufacture and market capital equipment and related supplies for medication management  which includes our infusion and medication dispensing technologies  supply dispensing technologies and respiratory technologies 
our products are designed to enable healthcare professionals to improve patient safety by reducing medication errors and improving administrative controls  while 
table of contents simultaneously improving workflow and increasing operational efficiency 
we sell these products primarily through our direct sales force  but use third party distributors as well  particularly outside the united states 
many of our products in this segment are integrated with other information systems within the hospital  including financial and business systems that support patient admissions  discharges and transfers  operational systems that include inventory management and clinical systems that include pharmacy information and electronic medical records 
we offer comprehensive value added services and programs  software and clinical education which are designed to enhance our customers utilization of our medical equipment products 
our project management  field service organization and customer call centers support our customers before  during and after product installation 
our project management teams assist customers with the development of project implementation plans which are designed to ensure rapid  seamless implementation of our products 
our field service organization provides on site expertise to resolve customers service issues 
our customer call centers provide additional support to our customers 
we also maintain a remote access system to help us quickly diagnose and rapidly resolve customers service issues 
the following chart presents the medical systems segment s key business lines and core products business line core products infusion systems iv medication safety and infusion therapy delivery systems  including dedicated disposables  software applications and related patient monitoring equipment sold primarily under the alaris brand dispensing technologies automated dispensing machines and related applications for distributing and managing medication and medical supplies sold primarily under the pyxis and rowa brands respiratory technologies respiratory ventilation equipment and dedicated circuits used during respiratory therapy  as well as equipment for respiratory diagnostics sold primarily under the avea  vela  and ltv series brands in addition  our medical systems segment includes our medmined business  which develops data mining surveillance software to help hospitals identify adverse drug events and hais 
infusion systems we are a leader in the design  development and marketing of iv infusion systems that deliver medications and other fluids directly into a patient s veins in precise  measured quantities over a wide range of infusion rates 
we have the largest installed base of large volume infusion pumps a key component of the infusion system in the united states 
we sell infusion products primarily to hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers and transport services 
our alaris system  sold primarily in the united states  is a sophisticated smart pump system that enables simultaneous iv medication and fluid administration from multiple infusion delivery modules  such as syringe pumps  large volume pumps  and patient controlled analgesia pumps  while at the same time monitoring vital signs such as respiratory activity and blood oxygen levels 
the alaris system utilizes our proprietary guardrails software application that alerts a clinician when an infusion parameter is outside the institution s pre established limitations known as a data set for that medication  thereby helping hospitals reduce iv medication administration errors 
using a centralized server  data sets and continuous quality improvement cqi data from the alaris system can be managed wirelessly 
cqi data is then evaluated by clinicians and used to determine best practices and refine the data sets 
in addition  data from the alaris system may be transmitted to other hospital information systems  including electronic medication administration records  pharmacy information systems  alarms  management applications and documentation systems 

table of contents in north america  each of our current large volume infusion pumps uses only dedicated disposable administration sets designed and manufactured by or for us for that particular pump 
accordingly  when we sell a large volume infusion pump to a customer  the sale results in a long term revenue stream associated with the dedicated disposables 
it also establishes a long term relationship with the customer that we believe provides an opportunity to sell additional products and services  including our clinically differentiated non dedicated iv sets and accessories  which comprise part of our infection prevention business line of our procedural solutions segment 
the international infusion systems market is more regionalized and fragmented than the united states market  and in many cases have different clinical practices than in the united states 
we have developed infusion products tailored to meet the different needs of certain of these markets 
as regions become more aware of the importance of patient safety  we expect the demand for more sophisticated products  like the alaris system  will increase as it has in the united states 
our infusion systems have an established presence in countries with a focus on patient safety  such as the united kingdom and australia 
dispensing technologies we are the leading provider of point of care systems that automate the dispensing of medications and supplies in hospitals and other healthcare facilities in the united states 
we sell our dispensing products primarily to hospitals and other healthcare facilities including oncology clinics  ambulatory surgical centers  long term care facilities and physician offices 
internationally  standards for clinical and pharmacy practice  the prevalence of clinical information systems and regulatory and reimbursement policies tend to vary by country and region 
for that reason  the international market for our current medication and supply dispensing products is in an early stage of development and one which we consider a long term growth opportunity 
in august  we acquired rowa  a german based company whose robotic medication storage and retrieval systems are designed to address elements of pharmacy operations requirements which are common outside of the united states 
the complexity of the medication dispensing process is a significant contributor to hospital inefficiencies 
in  we championed the concept of decentralized medication management where medications are securely maintained and accessed at the nurse s unit and became the first to introduce automated dispensing products to the market 
our dispensing technologies products are designed to help healthcare professionals reduce medication errors  enhance administrative controls  improve clinician workflow  increase operational efficiency and improve billing accuracy 
in addition  our products enable healthcare professionals to provide safer patient care by helping to ensure that the right medications are delivered in the right doses via the right routes to the right patients at the right times 
our pyxis medication management products automate the management of medications from the pharmacy to the nursing unit and integrate with other operational and information systems within the hospital 
other pyxis products that are focused on medication management include the pyxis anesthesia system for medication dispensing in the or  the pyxis connect physician order management system which streamlines the physician order process  decreases order turnaround time and reduces transcription errors  and the pyxis ecostation system  which can help hospitals identify  classify and segregate pharmaceutical waste and facilitate tracking and regulatory control reporting requirements 
our product offering also includes phacts pharmacy inventory management software which helps hospital pharmacies better manage inventory  reduce pharmaceutical costs  and streamline operations 
in addition  we have other product offerings that are designed to help secure  track and replenish supplies of controlled substances and help ensure the accuracy of medication orders filled in the pharmacy and delivered to the pyxis medstation system 
in addition to medication dispensing  we also offer a comprehensive portfolio of medical supply management systems at the point of use  including the pyxis supplystation system and the pyxis procedurestation system  
table of contents which are supply dispensing systems with controlled access and radio frequency features that deliver custom solutions tailored to meet the needs of each customer 
we also offer wireless handheld technology that supports both our infusion and dispensing businesses 
our positive patient identification applications for bedside verification are critical enablers of our integrated medication management and patient safety capabilities 
we believe these technologies can also help healthcare providers improve patient charting and review 
to help provide financial flexibility to our customers  we offer them the opportunity to lease our dispensing products 
we provide the financing for the majority of our customers under our leasing program rather than relying on third party providers of credit 
respiratory technologies we develop  manufacture  market and service mechanical ventilators and associated proprietary consumables for patients with respiratory disorders 
patients with a need for respiratory support are among the highest cost  highest risk  largest and fastest growing hospital populations 
we offer an extensive line of industry leading mechanical ventilators marketed globally that treat respiratory insufficiency

based on their compact size and versatility  ltv series ventilators are used in critical care  emergency departments  long term care and home care  as well as emergency transport and military applications 
in november  we acquired intermed  a brazil based company that designs  manufactures and markets a variety of ventilators and respiratory care devices for infant  pediatric and adult patients that are used in hospitals in brazil and across latin america 
several of our ventilator systems  including the ltv series ventilators  use only dedicated disposable ventilator circuits in the provision of respiratory therapy 
accordingly  when we sell an ltv series ventilator  the sale results in a long term revenue stream associated with the dedicated disposables 
we also manufacture and market specialty ventilators such as high frequency oscillatory ventilators hfov and sipap 
our hfovs are designed to provide superior pulmonary gas exchange  while protecting the patient s lungs from damage that may be caused by the cyclic expansion and contraction characteristic of conventional mechanical ventilation 
our hfov products are primarily used to treat children and premature infants who suffer from acute respiratory failure and adults who suffer from acute lung injury 
sipap is a unique form of non invasive support for infants  which has been shown to lower work of breathing and reduce the need for more costly invasive forms of support 
our customers face increasing pressure to manage costs and outcomes 
to meet these challenges  we developed an innovative system approach to respiratory care by leveraging the experience gained by our infusion and dispensing businesses related to medical device interoperability 
we now offer the carefusion ventilation system  which enables customers to access actionable information to support respiratory care and help them to improve clinical and operational outcomes 
this system approach also enables a new level of interoperability with hospital electronic medical record applications 
the system includes a handheld  positive patient id application that automates the collection of ventilator documentation data at the point of care and wirelessly transmits it to the hospital electronic medical record system 
in addition  our respiratory technologies business line includes our respiratory diagnostics products  which includes pulmonary function testing equipment  metabolic and stress testing equipment  spirometers and other equipment sold under our jaeger  sensormedics and other brands

we intend to continue our focus on research and development as a key strategy for growth  which will focus on internal and external investments in those fields that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability 

table of contents quality management we place significant emphasis on providing quality products and services to our customers 
quality management plays an essential role in understanding and meeting customer requirements  effectively resolving quality issues and improving our products and services 
we have a network of quality systems throughout our business lines and facilities that relate to the design  development  manufacturing  packaging  sterilization  handling  distribution and labeling of our products 
to assess and facilitate compliance with applicable requirements  we regularly review our quality systems to determine their effectiveness and identify areas for improvement 
we also perform assessments of our suppliers of raw materials  components and finished goods 
in addition  we conduct quality management reviews designed to inform management of key issues that may affect the quality of products and services 
from time to time  we may determine that products manufactured or marketed by us do not meet our specifications  published standards or regulatory requirements 
when a quality issue is identified  we investigate the issue and seek to take appropriate corrective action  such as withdrawal of the product from the market  correction of the product at the customer location  notice to the customer of revised labeling or other actions 
any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 
regulatory matters regulation of medical devices in the united states the development  manufacture  sale and distribution of our medical device products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation 
most notably  all of our medical devices sold in the united states are subject to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdc act  as implemented and enforced by the united states food and drug administration fda 
the fda  and in some cases other government agencies  administers requirements for the design  testing  safety  effectiveness  manufacturing  labeling  advertising and promotion  distribution and post market surveillance of our products 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we market must first receive either clearance by submitting a premarket notification k or approval by filing a premarket approval application pma from the fda pursuant to the fdc act 
in addition  certain modifications made to marketed devices also may require k clearance or approval of a pma supplement 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from four to twelve months  but it can last longer 
the process of obtaining pma approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
it generally takes from one to three years or even longer 
in  the fda issued draft guidance related to its medical device k clearance process  and through this guidance the fda established additional pre market requirements 
the fda intends to issue additional guidance documents and regulations over the coming months  which is expected to  among other things  revise certain aspects of the k review process 
although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives  the fda is expected to make changes that would make the k clearance process and pma approval more expensive for us to bring many of our medical devices to market and could result in delays of future launches of new or modified medical devices 
in addition  we cannot be sure that k clearance or pma approval will be obtained for any product that we propose to market 
after a device is placed on the market  numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply 
those regulatory requirements include the following product listing and establishment registration  adherence to the quality system regulation qsr which requires stringent design  testing  control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures  labeling requirements and fda prohibitions against the promotion of off label uses or indications  adverse event reporting  post approval restrictions or conditions  including post approval clinical trials or other required testing  post market surveillance requirements  the fda s recall authority  whereby it can ask for the recall of products from the market  and requirements relating to voluntary corrections or removals 
the fda is also expected to issue final guidance documents and regulations over the coming months regarding 
table of contents the unique device identification udi system  which will require manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers 
while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety  it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling  which could increase our costs 
our manufacturing facilities  as well as those of certain of our suppliers  are subject to periodic and for cause inspections to verify compliance with the qsr as well as other regulatory requirements 
if the fda were to find that we or certain of our suppliers have failed to comply with applicable regulations  it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions  such as product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  consent decrees  injunctions to halt manufacturing and distributing products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals  import detentions of products made outside of the united states  restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device manufactured or distributed by us 
any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 
regulation of medical devices outside of the united states medical device laws also are in effect in many of the non united states markets in which we do business 
these laws range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our products to requests for product data or certifications 
inspection of and controls over manufacturing  as well as monitoring of device related adverse events  are components of most of these regulatory systems 
most of our business is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate  and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation 
for example  the european commission ec has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through european medical device directives with which manufacturers must comply 
under these regulations  manufacturers must have received product ec certification from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the european union 
certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products with an ec mark 
products covered by the ec regulations that do not bear the ec mark may not be sold or distributed within the european union 
regulation of drugs we market a line of topical antiseptics that are regulated by the fda and comparable international authorities as nonprescription or over the counter otc drugs 
these products are marketed in the us under a new drug application approved by the fda and through appropriate international regulatory pathways  or through the otc drug monograph process 
otc drugs are regulated and we must comply with good manufacturing practices  for example  our manufacturing facilities or those of our contract manufacturers must be registered and all facilities are subject to inspection by federal and state authorities 
outside the united states  regulatory authorities regulate our otc products in a manner similar to the fda 
in the united states  advertising of otc drugs is regulated by the federal trade commission in conjunction with the fda  which imposes certain restrictions on our promotional activities for these products 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with regulatory requirements  we could face sanctions ranging from warning letters  injunctions  product seizures  civil or criminal enforcement actions  consent decrees  or removal of the product from distribution 
any of these actions could have an adverse effect on our business 
healthcare laws we are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the united states targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry  which generally prohibit us from soliciting  offering  receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare  medicaid or other government sponsored healthcare programs 
healthcare costs have been and continue to be a subject of study  investigation and regulation by governmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world 

table of contents the united states federal government continues to scrutinize potentially fraudulent practices affecting medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
payers have become more influential in the marketplace and increasingly are focused on drug and medical device pricing  appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs of healthcare 
violations of fraud and abuse related laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions  including substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
other regulatory requirements we are also subject to the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws applicable in non united states jurisdictions that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to non united states government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
because of the predominance of government sponsored healthcare systems around the world  most of our customer relationships outside of the united states are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti bribery laws 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws 
we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree  and in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
in the sale  delivery and servicing of our medical devices and software outside of the united states  we must also comply with various export control and trade embargo laws and regulations  including those administered by the department of treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac and the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security bis which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and or with certain individuals identified by the united states government 
despite our global trade and compliance program  our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents 
violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions  including substantial fines and imprisonment 
raw materials we use a wide variety of resin  metals and electrical components for production of our products 
we primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers  some of which are single source suppliers 
we purchase materials from selected suppliers based on quality assurance  cost effectiveness and constraints resulting from regulatory requirements  and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability 
global commodity pricing can ultimately affect pricing of certain of these raw materials 
though we believe we have adequate available sources of raw materials  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to access the quantity of raw material needed to sustain operations as well as at a cost effective price 
environmental our manufacturing operations worldwide are subject to many requirements under environmental laws 
in the united states  the united states environmental protection agency and similar state agencies administer laws that restrict the emission of pollutants into the air  discharges of pollutants into bodies of water and disposal of pollutants on the ground 
violations of these laws can result in significant civil and criminal penalties and incarceration 
the failure to obtain a permit for certain activities may be a violation of environmental law and subject the owner and operator to civil and criminal sanctions 
most environmental agencies also have the power to shut down an operation if it is operating in violation of environmental law 
united states laws also typically allow citizens to bring private enforcement actions in some situations 
outside the united states  the environmental laws and their enforcement vary and may be more burdensome 
for example  some european countries impose environmental taxes or require manufacturers to take back used products at the end of their useful life  and others restrict the materials that manufacturers may use in their products and require redesign and labeling of products 
although such laws do not currently have a significant impact on our products  they are expanding rapidly in europe 
we have management programs and processes in place that are intended to minimize the potential for violations of these laws 

table of contents other environmental laws  primarily in the united states  address the contamination of land and groundwater and require the clean up of such contamination 
these laws may apply not only to the owner or operator of an on going business  but also to the owner of land contaminated by a prior owner or operator 
in addition  if a parcel is contaminated by the release of a hazardous substance  such as through its historic use as a disposal site  any person or company that has contributed to that contamination  whether or not it has a legal interest in the land  may be subject to a requirement to clean up the parcel 
employees at june   we employed approximately  people across our global operations  with approximately  employed in the united states 
in europe  some of our employees are represented by unions or works councils 
overall  we consider our employee relations to be good

item a 
risk factors we urge you to carefully consider the following risks and other information in this annual report on form k in evaluating us and our common stock 
any of the following risks  as well as additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
the risk factors generally have been separated into two groups risks related to our business and risks related to our common stock 
risks related to our business we may be unable to effectively enhance our existing products or introduce and market new products or may fail to keep pace with advances in technology 
the healthcare industry is characterized by evolving technologies and industry standards  frequent new product introductions  significant competition and dynamic customer requirements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the industry could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features and functions of competing products  as well as the pricing models for such products 
the success of our business depends on our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new 
table of contents products and adapt to these changing technologies and customer requirements 
the success of new product development depends on many factors  including our ability to anticipate and satisfy customer needs  obtain regulatory approvals and clearances on a timely basis  develop and manufacture products in a cost effective and timely manner  maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property and differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
to compete successfully in the marketplace  we must make substantial investments in new product development whether internally or externally through licensing  acquisitions or joint development agreements 
our failure to enhance our existing products or introduce new and innovative products in a timely manner would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
even if we are able to develop  manufacture and obtain regulatory approvals and clearances for our new products  the success of those products would depend upon market acceptance 
levels of market acceptance for our new products could be affected by several factors  including the availability of alternative products from our competitors  the price and reliability of our products relative to that of our competitors  the timing of our market entry  and our ability to market and distribute our products effectively 
we are subject to complex and costly regulation 
our products are subject to regulation by the fda and other national  supranational  federal and state governmental authorities 
it can be costly and time consuming to obtain regulatory clearance and or approval to market a medical device or other product 
clearance and or approval might not be granted for a new or modified device or other product on a timely basis  if at all 
regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative  administrative or judicial action  which may further increase our costs or reduce sales 
unless an exception applies  the fda requires that the manufacturer of a new medical device or a new indication for use of  or other significant change in  an existing medical device obtain either k pre market clearance or pre market approval before those products can be marketed or sold in the united states 
modifications or enhancements to a product that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device  technology  materials  labeling  packaging  or manufacturing process may also require a new k clearance 
in  the fda issued draft guidance related to its k pre market clearance process  and through this guidance the fda established additional pre market requirements 
the fda intends to issue additional guidance documents and regulations over the coming months  which is expected to  among other things  revise certain aspects of the k review process 
although we cannot predict with certainty the future impact of these initiatives  it appears that the time and cost to get many of our medical devices to market could increase significantly 
in addition  we are subject to regulations that govern manufacturing practices  product labeling and advertising  and adverse event reporting that apply after we have obtained clearance or approval to sell a product 
our failure to maintain clearances or approvals for existing products  to obtain clearance or approval for new or modified products  or to adhere to regulations for manufacturing  labeling  advertising or adverse event reporting could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
further  if we determine a product manufactured or marketed by us does not meet our specifications  published standards or regulatory requirements  we may seek to correct the product or withdraw the product from the market  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
many of our facilities and procedures and those of our suppliers are subject to ongoing oversight  including periodic inspection by governmental authorities 
compliance with production  safety  quality control and quality assurance regulations can be costly and time consuming 
the fda is also expected to issue final guidance documents and regulations over the coming months regarding the unique device identification udi system  which will require manufacturers to mark certain medical devices with unique identifiers 
while the fda expects that the udi system will help track products during recalls and improve patient safety  it will require us to make changes to our manufacturing and labeling  which could increase our costs 

table of contents the sales and marketing of medical devices is under increased scrutiny by the fda and other enforcement bodies 
if our sales and marketing activities fail to comply with fda regulations or guidelines  or other applicable laws  we may be subject to warnings or enforcement actions from the fda or other enforcement bodies 
a number of companies in the healthcare industry have been the subject of enforcement actions related to their sales and marketing practices  including their relationships with doctors and off label promotion of products 
in april  we received a federal administrative subpoena from the department of justice 
in addition  in september  we received a federal administrative subpoena from the office of inspector general oig of the department of health and human services 
in august  we received another federal administrative subpoena from the department of justice containing additional information requests 
all three subpoenas request documents and other materials that relate primarily to our sales and marketing practices for our chloraprep skin preparation product and information regarding our relationships with healthcare professionals 
in april  we announced an agreement in principle pursuant to which we expect to pay the government approximately million to resolve the government s allegations 
in connection with these matters  we also entered into a non prosecution agreement and will continue to cooperate with the government 
the agreement in principle remains subject to several conditions  including the completion and execution of a formal settlement agreement and other required documentation 
there can be no assurance that we complete the required documentation or finalize the settlement with the government on the proposed terms or at all 
the amount and timing of the payment are subject to the final terms of the settlement agreement 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k for more information 
we cannot control the pace or scope of any investigation and responding to the subpoena requests and any investigation will require the allocation of resources  including management time and attention 
if we were to become the subject of an enforcement action  including any action resulting from the investigation by the department of justice or oig  it could result in negative publicity  penalties  fines  the exclusion of our products from reimbursement under federally funded programs and or prohibitions on our ability to sell our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
cost containment efforts of our customers  purchasing groups  third party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
many existing and potential customers for our products within the united states are members of gpos and idns in an effort to reduce costs 
gpos and idns negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members 
due to the highly competitive nature of the gpo and idn contracting processes  we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major gpos and idns across our product portfolio 
furthermore  the increasing leverage of organized buying groups may reduce market prices for our products  thereby reducing our profitability 
while having a contract with a gpo or idn can facilitate sales to members of that gpo or idn  it is no assurance that sales volume of those products will be maintained 
the members of such groups may choose to purchase from our competitors due to the price or quality offered by such competitors  which could result in a decline in our sales and profitability 
in addition  our capital equipment products typically represent a sizeable initial capital expenditure for healthcare organizations 
changes in the budgets of these organizations  the timing of spending under these budgets and conflicting spending priorities  including changes resulting from adverse economic conditions  can have a significant effect on the demand for our capital equipment products and related services 
in addition  the implementation of healthcare reform in the united states  which may reduce or eliminate the amount that healthcare organizations may be reimbursed for our capital equipment products and related services  could further impact demand 
any such decreases in expenditures by these healthcare facilities and decreases in demand for our capital equipment products and related services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents distributors of our products may begin to negotiate terms of sale more aggressively in an effort to increase their profitability 
failure to negotiate distribution arrangements having advantageous pricing or other terms of sale could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we fail to implement distribution arrangements successfully  it could cause us to lose market share to our competitors 
outside the united states  we have experienced downward pricing pressure due to the concentration of purchasing power in centralized governmental healthcare authorities and increased efforts by such authorities to lower healthcare costs 
our failure to offer acceptable prices to these customers could adversely affect our sales and profitability in these markets 
current economic conditions have and may continue to adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy and the economic outlook of the united states  europe and other parts of the world have had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
recessionary conditions and depressed levels of consumer and commercial spending have caused and may continue to cause our customers to reduce  modify  delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and have caused and may continue to cause vendors to reduce their output or change terms of sales 
we have observed certain hospitals delaying as well as prioritizing capital purchasing decisions  which has had and we expect will continue to have an adverse impact on our financial results into the foreseeable future 
in addition  as a result of these recessionary conditions  our customers in and outside of the united states  including foreign governmental entities or other entities that rely on government healthcare systems or government funding  may be unable to pay their obligations on a timely basis or to make payment in full 
if our customers cash flow or operating and financial performance deteriorate or fail to improve  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us 
these conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers  which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products 
we also extend credit through an equipment leasing program for a substantial portion of sales to our dispensing product customers 
this program and any similar programs that we may establish for sales of our other capital equipment  exposes us to certain risks 
we are subject to the risk that if these customers fail to pay or delay payment for the products they purchase from us  it could result in longer payment cycles  increased collection costs  defaults exceeding our expectations and an adverse impact on the cost or availability of financing 
these risks related to our equipment leasing program may be exacerbated by a variety of factors  including adverse economic conditions  decreases in demand for our capital equipment products and negative trends in the businesses of our leasing customers 
any inability of current and or potential customers to pay us for our products or any demands by vendors for different payment terms may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to realize any benefit from our cost reduction and restructuring efforts and our profitability may be hurt or our business otherwise might be adversely affected 
we have engaged in restructuring activities in the past and may engage in other restructuring activities in the future 
these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities are complex 
if we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities  or any other restructuring activities that we may take in the future  any expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized  and our operations and business could be disrupted 
in addition  the costs associated with implementing restructuring activities might exceed expectations  which could result in additional future charges 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights or may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient 
we cannot be sure that our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents to us  that patents issued to or licensed by us in the past or in the future will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors or that these patents will remain valid or sufficiently broad to preclude our competitors from introducing technologies similar to those covered by our patents and patent applications 
in addition  our ability to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the united states  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market position in such countries by utilizing technologies that are similar to those developed or licensed by us 
competitors also may harm our sales by designing products that mirror the capabilities of our products or technology without infringing our intellectual property rights 
if we do not obtain sufficient protection for our intellectual property  or if we are unable to effectively enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitiveness could be impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenue 
we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation 
patent litigation is costly to defend and can result in significant damage awards  including treble damages under certain circumstances  and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or force us to make significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the affected products 
at any given time  we are involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of patent infringement actions  the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
we can expect to face additional claims of patent infringement in the future 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
defects or failures associated with our products and or our quality system could lead to the filing of adverse event reports  product recalls or safety alerts with associated negative publicity and could subject us to regulatory actions 
manufacturing flaws  component failures  design defects  off label uses or inadequate disclosure of product related information could result in an unsafe condition or the injury or death of a patient 
these problems could lead to a recall of  or issuance of a safety alert relating to  our products and result in significant costs and negative publicity 
due to the strong name recognition of our brands  an adverse event involving one of our products could result in reduced market acceptance and demand for all products within that brand  and could harm our reputation and our ability to market our products in the future 
in some circumstances  adverse events arising from or associated with the design  manufacture or marketing of our products could result in the suspension or delay of regulatory reviews of our applications for new product approvals or clearances 
we may also voluntarily undertake a recall of our products  temporarily shut down production lines  or place products on a shipping hold based on internal safety and quality monitoring and testing data 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to sustain an effective quality control system and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to our quality system 
our quality system plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements  preventing defects and improving our products and services 
while we have a network of quality systems throughout our business lines and facilities  quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products 
a quality or safety issue may result in a public warning letter from the fda  or potentially a consent decree 
we are currently operating under an amended consent decree with the fda  as discussed further below 
in addition  we may be subject to product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  injunctions to halt manufacturing and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals  import detentions of products made outside the united states  restrictions on operations or withdrawal 
table of contents or suspension of existing approvals 
any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are currently operating under an amended consent decree with the fda and our failure to comply with the requirements of the amended consent decree may have an adverse effect on our business 
we are operating under an amended consent decree with the fda related to our infusion pump business in the united states 
we entered into a consent decree with the fda in february related to our alaris se pumps  and in february  we and the fda amended the consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states 
in accordance with the amended consent decree  and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree  we implemented a corrective action plan to bring the alaris system and all other infusion pumps in use in the united states market into compliance  had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert 
in july  the fda notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree  which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities 
the costs associated with these ongoing audits  and any actions that we may need to take resulting from these audits  could be significant 
we have no reserves associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 
as such  we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because  among other things  the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree  and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree 
moreover  the matters addressed in the amended consent decree could lead to negative publicity that could have an adverse impact on our business 
the amended consent decree authorizes the fda  in the event of any violations in the future  to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing  recall products and take other actions 
we may also be required to pay monetary damages if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k for more information 
any of the foregoing matters could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may incur product liability losses and other litigation liability 
we are  and may be in the future  subject to product liability claims and lawsuits  including potential class actions  alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury 
any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could be costly to defend and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of insurance 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all because insurance varies in cost and can be difficult to obtain 
our failure to successfully defend against product liability claims or maintain adequate insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are involved in a number of legal proceedings 
legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable  and the outcome can result in excessive verdicts and or injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business  or we may enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages that exceed our insurance coverage  if any 
in addition  we cannot predict the results of future legislative activity or future court decisions  any of which could lead to an increase in regulatory investigations or our exposure to litigation 
any such proceedings or investigations  regardless of the merits  may result in substantial costs  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns and additional restrictions on our sales or the use of our products  which could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we rely on the performance of our information technology systems  the failure of which could have an adverse effect on our business and performance 
our business requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure 
these systems are vulnerable to interruption by fire  power loss  system malfunction  computer viruses  cyber attacks and other events  which are beyond our control 
systems interruptions could reduce our ability to manufacture and provide service for our products  and could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 
the level of protection and disaster recovery capability varies from site to site  and there can be no guarantee that any such plans  to the extent they are in place  will be totally effective 
in addition  security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us  our employees  partners  customers  or our suppliers  which may result in significant costs and government sanctions 
in particular  if we are unable to adequately safeguard individually identifiable health information  we may be subject to additional liability under domestic and international laws respecting the privacy and security of health information 
we also are pursuing initiatives to transform our information technology systems and processes 
many of our business lines use disparate systems and processes  including those required to support critical functions related to our operations  sales  and financial close and reporting 
we are implementing new systems to better streamline and integrate critical functions  which we expect to result in improved efficiency and  over time  reduced costs 
while we believe these initiatives provide significant opportunity for us  they do expose us to inherent risks 
we may suffer data loss or delays or other disruptions to our business  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to successfully implement new information technology systems and processes  we may fail to realize cost savings anticipated to be derived from these initiatives 
an interruption in our ability to manufacture our products  an inability to obtain key components or raw materials or an increase in the cost of key components or raw materials may adversely affect our business 
many of our key products are manufactured at single locations  with limited alternate facilities 
if we experience damage to one or more of our facilities  or our manufacturing capabilities are otherwise limited or stopped due to quality  regulatory or other reasons  it may not be possible to timely manufacture the relevant products at previous levels or at all 
in addition  if the capabilities of our suppliers and component manufacturers are limited or stopped  due to quality  regulatory or other reasons  it could negatively impact our ability to manufacture our products and could expose us to regulatory actions 
further  for reasons of quality assurance or cost effectiveness  we purchase certain components and raw materials from sole suppliers 
we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials 
a reduction or interruption in manufacturing  or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components that are acceptable to us  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third party payers  we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers 
if the cost of key components or raw materials increases and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions  we could experience lower margins and profitability 
new regulations related to conflict minerals may increase our costs and adversely affect our business 
we are subject to the sec s newly adopted regulations  which require us to determine which of our products contain certain specified minerals  referred to under the regulations as conflict minerals  and  if so  to perform an extensive inquiry into our supply chain  in an effort to determine whether or not such conflict minerals originate from the democratic republic of congo drc  or an adjoining country 
under the regulations  we are required to file a report with the sec by may   to disclose and report whether or not such conflict 
table of contents minerals originate from the drc or an adjoining country 
at this time  we have determined that certain of our products contain such specified minerals and have developed a process by which we can identify where such minerals originated 
we expect to incur additional costs to comply with these disclosure requirements  including costs related to determining the sources of the specified minerals used in our products  which may adversely affect our business 
in addition  the number of suppliers who provide conflict free minerals may be limited  which may make it difficult to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so 
we may engage in strategic transactions  including acquisitions  investments  or joint development agreements that may have an adverse effect on our business 
we may pursue transactions  including acquisitions of complementary businesses  technology licensing arrangements and joint development agreements to expand our product offerings and geographic presence as part of our business strategy  which could be material to our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not complete transactions in a timely manner  on a cost effective basis  or at all  and we may not realize the expected benefits of any acquisition  license arrangement or joint development agreement 
other companies may compete with us for these strategic opportunities 
we also could experience negative effects on our results of operations and financial condition from acquisition related charges  amortization of intangible assets and asset impairment charges  and other issues that could arise in connection with  or as a result of  the acquisition of an acquired company or business  including issues related to internal control over financial reporting  regulatory or compliance issues and potential adverse short term effects on results of operations through increased costs or otherwise 
these effects  individually or in the aggregate  could cause a deterioration of our credit profile and or ratings and result in reduced availability of credit to us or in increased borrowing costs and interest expense 
we could experience difficulties  expenditures  or other risks in integrating an acquired company  business  or technology  including  among others diversion of management resources and focus from ongoing business matters  retention of key employees following an acquisition  demands on our operational resources and financial and internal control systems  integration of an acquired company s corporate and administrative functions and personnel  liabilities of the acquired company  including litigation or other claims  and consolidation of research and development operations 
in addition  we may face additional risks related to foreign acquisitions  including risks related to cultural and language differences and particular economic  currency  political  and regulatory risks associated with specific countries 
if an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our existing business  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we may engage in the divestiture of some of our non core product lines which may have an adverse effect on our business 
our business strategy involves assessing our portfolio of products with a view of divesting non core product lines that do not align with our objectives 
any divestitures may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings  as well as significant write offs  including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
divestitures could involve additional risks  including difficulties in the separation of operations  services  products and personnel  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  the disruption of our business and the potential loss of key employees 
we may not be successful in managing these or any other significant risks that we encounter in divesting a product line 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of our divestitures 

table of contents we may face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes 
in march  comprehensive healthcare reform legislation was signed into law in the united states through the passage of the patient protection and affordable health care act and the health care and education reconciliation act ppaca 
among other initiatives  the legislation implemented a annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the united states  effective january as this excise tax is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense  it has and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations 
in fiscal year  we paid approximately million related to six months of the medical device tax 
we currently expect the impact of the tax to be approximately million to million in fiscal year and annually thereafter 
in addition  the ppaca significantly alters medicare and medicaid reimbursements for medical services and medical devices  which could result in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our products 
as additional provisions of healthcare reform are implemented  we anticipate that congress  regulatory agencies and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access 
we cannot predict with certainty what healthcare initiatives  if any  will be implemented at the state level  or what ultimate effect federal healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation may have on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services 
however  the implementation of new legislation and regulation may lower reimbursements for our products  reduce medical procedure volumes and adversely affect our business  possibly materially 
we may need additional financing in the future to meet our capital needs or to make opportunistic acquisitions and such financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  and may be dilutive to existing stockholders 
we intend to increase our investment in research and development activities  expand our sales and marketing activities  and may make acquisitions 
our ability to take these and other actions may be limited by our available liquidity  including our ability to access our foreign cash balances in a tax efficient manner 
as a consequence  in the future  we may need to seek additional financing 
we may be unable to obtain any desired additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if we lose an investment grade credit rating or adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could negatively affect our business 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution of their ownership interest 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations due to restrictive covenants 
additionally  our ability to make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations will depend on our operating and financial performance  which in turn is subject to prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states 
our operations outside of the united states are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non united states laws  regulations and customs 
sales to customers outside of the united states made up approximately of our revenue in the fiscal year ended june   and we expect that non united states sales will contribute to future growth as we continue to focus on expanding our operations in markets outside the united states 
the risks associated with our operations outside the united states include healthcare reform legislation  changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs  changes in non united states government programs  multiple non united states regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict our ability to manufacture and sell our products  
table of contents possible failure to comply with anti bribery laws such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws in other jurisdictions  different local medical practices  product preferences and product requirements  possible failure to comply with trade protection and restriction measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in establishing  staffing and managing non united states operations  different labor regulations or work stoppages or strikes  changes in environmental  health and safety laws  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws  including changes regarding taxation of income earned outside the united states  political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  economic instability  including the european financial crisis or other economic instability in other parts of the world and the impact on interest rates  inflation and the credit worthiness of our customers  uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures  minimal or diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries  and regulatory changes that may place our products at a disadvantage 
these risks  individually or in the aggregate  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  we are subject to compliance with the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar anti bribery laws  which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
while our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws  we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws  despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics 
the occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business  performance  prospects  value  financial condition  and results of operations 
we are also exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if the united states dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries such as the euro  where we sell our products  our united states dollar reported revenue and income will decrease 
additionally  we incur significant costs in foreign currencies and a fluctuation in those currencies value can negatively impact manufacturing and selling costs 
changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and  in some instances  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulations that could result in significant liability  require us to change our business practices and restrict our operations in the future 
we are subject to various united states federal  state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry  including anti kickback and false claims laws 
violations of these laws are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions  including substantial fines  imprisonment and exclusion from participation in healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
these laws and regulations are wide ranging and subject to changing interpretation and application  which could restrict our sales or marketing practices 
furthermore  since many of our customers rely on reimbursement from medicare  medicaid and other governmental programs to cover a substantial portion of their expenditures  our exclusion from such programs as a result of a violation of these laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness  which could adversely affect our business and our ability to meet our obligations 
we have outstanding billion of senior unsecured notes 
this significant amount of debt has important risks to us and our investors  including requiring a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments on this debt  making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations  
table of contents increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt  which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  placing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt as we are  and limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise  pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock 
in addition  we maintain a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility maturing july  
to the extent that we draw on our credit facility or otherwise incur additional indebtedness  the risks described above could increase 
further  if we increase our indebtedness  our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected 
our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to repay all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due  and we may not be able to borrow money  sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms  or at all  to refinance our debt 
as a result of various restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our senior unsecured notes  our financial flexibility will be restricted in a number of ways 
the agreement governing the credit facility subjects us to several financial and other restrictive covenants  including limitations on liens  subsidiary indebtedness and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the failure to timely file our periodic reports with the sec could result in a default under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the indenture governing our senior unsecured notes 
in fiscal year  we failed to timely file certain of our periodic reports with the sec 
while we are now in compliance with these reporting covenants  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain all waivers related to any future filing delays or remedy any future events that could trigger an event of default under the credit agreement for our senior unsecured credit facility and the indenture for our senior unsecured notes 
our credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial ratio tests on an ongoing basis that may require us to take action and reduce debt or act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
events beyond our control  including changes in general economic and business conditions  may affect our ability to meet those financial ratios and financial condition tests 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to meet those tests or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet those tests 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our credit facility 
if an event of default under our credit facility or senior unsecured notes occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if such an acceleration of indebtedness were to arise from an event of default  we may not have sufficient funds to repay such indebtedness 
any acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we are a large multinational corporation with operations in the united states and international jurisdictions 
as such  we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the united states federal  state and local governments and of many international jurisdictions 
from time to time  various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions 
we cannot be sure that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives 
in addition  united states federal  state and local  as well as international  tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations 
there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

cardinal health is before the internal revenue service irs appeals office with respect to its fiscal years through  and is under audit for fiscal years through during the quarter ended september   cardinal health received an irs revenue agent s report for the fiscal years ending june  through that included notices of proposed adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between our foreign and domestic subsidiaries and the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries  which we have appealed 
the amount of additional tax proposed by the irs in these notices totals million  excluding penalties and interest 
during the quarter ended june   we and cardinal health entered into a closing agreement with the irs to effectively settle the matters related to the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries 
as part of the settlement  we agreed to pay million million net of tax which includes million of interest 
this closing agreement resolves million of the original million of additional tax proposed by the irs related to fiscal years through in addition  during the quarter ended december  we received an irs revenue agent s report for fiscal years and that included notices of proposed adjustment related to transfer pricing arrangements between foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
we and cardinal health disagree with the irs regarding its application of the united states treasury regulations to the arrangements under review and the valuations underlying such adjustments and intend to vigorously contest them 
we are currently before the irs appeals office for fiscal years through  and continue to engage in substantive discussions related to these fiscal years 
during the quarter ended september   the irs commenced the tax audit for the fiscal years and and the short period july  through august  as part of cardinal health s tax audit of its federal consolidated returns for fiscal years through during the quarter ended december   the irs commenced the tax audit for the short period september  through june  furthermore  during the quarter ended june   the irs commenced the tax audit for fiscal year we have not received any notices of proposed adjustment for these audit periods to date 
we regularly review our tax reserves and make adjustments to our reserves when appropriate 
accounting for tax reserves involves complex and subjective estimates by management  which can change over time based on new information or changing events or circumstances  including events or circumstances outside of our control 
although we believe that we have provided appropriate tax reserves for any potential tax exposures  we may not be fully reserved and it is possible that we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of our reserves 
the tax matters agreement that we entered into with cardinal health in connection with the separation generally provides that the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability related to our business is our responsibility 
any future change in estimate or obligation could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k filed for a discussion of the notices of proposed adjustment for our fiscal years ended through and our settlement agreement with the irs 
if there is a determination that the separation is taxable for united states federal income tax purposes because the facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings underlying the irs ruling or tax opinions are incorrect or for any other reason  then cardinal health and its shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant united states federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities 
in connection with the separation  cardinal health received a private letter ruling from the irs substantially to the effect that  among other things  the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is tax free for united states federal income tax purposes under sections a and a d of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code 
in addition  cardinal health received opinions of weil  gotshal manges llp and wachtell  lipton  rosen katz  co counsel to cardinal health  to the effect that the contribution and the distribution qualified as a transaction that is described in sections a and a d of the code 
the ruling and opinions relied on certain facts  assumptions  representations and undertakings from cardinal health and us regarding the past and future conduct of the companies respective businesses and other 
table of contents matters 
if any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings were incorrect or not otherwise satisfied  cardinal health and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities 
notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax counsel  the irs could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts  assumptions  representations or undertakings are not correct  have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinions that are not covered by the private letter ruling  or for other reasons  including as a result of certain significant changes in the stock ownership of cardinal health or us after the separation 
if the separation is determined to be taxable for united states federal income tax purposes  cardinal health and its shareholders that are subject to united states federal income tax could incur significant united states federal income tax liabilities and we could incur significant liabilities 
our success depends on our ability to recruit and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development  sales  marketing and operations personnel 
experienced personnel in our industry are in high demand and competition for their talents is intense 
if we are unable to recruit and retain key personnel  our business may be harmed 
achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors  including the intense competition for such highly skilled personnel  fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions  changes in our senior management  competitors hiring practices  and the effectiveness of our compensation programs 
if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate such personnel in sufficient numbers and on a timely basis  we may experience difficulty in implementing our business strategy  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective 
under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules promulgated by the sec  companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting 
as part of this process  we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting  our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting  and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to and report on management s assessment and the effectiveness our internal control over financial reporting 
management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of june   identified a material weakness related to our accounting for our dispensing sales type leases 
this material weakness could lead to a loss of investor confidence and could have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 
as described in item a controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting  we have developed and implemented new control procedures regarding our accounting for sales type leases  including the revised fair value estimation process for our leased assets  and we concluded that we had remediated this material weakness as of june  we will need to monitor and evaluate these procedures to ensure that they are operating effectively 
we may be at risk for future material weaknesses  particularly if these new procedures do not operate effectively 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations  lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock 
risks related to our common stock your percentage of ownership in us may be diluted in the future 
as with any publicly traded company  your percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future because of equity issuances for acquisitions  capital market transactions or otherwise  including equity awards that we expect will be granted to our directors  officers and employees 

table of contents our stock price may fluctuate significantly 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  some of which may be beyond our control  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in earnings estimated by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates  the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies  and domestic and foreign economic conditions 
certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by laws  and of delaware law  may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company  which could decrease the trading price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  our amended and restated by laws and delaware law contain provisions that are intended to deter coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids by making such practices or bids unacceptably expensive to the raider and to encourage prospective acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors rather than to attempt a hostile takeover 
these provisions include  among others the inability of our stockholders to call a special meeting  rules regarding how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at stockholder meetings  the right of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  the division of our board of directors into three classes of directors  with each class serving a staggered three year term  a provision that stockholders may only remove directors with cause  the ability of our directors  and not stockholders  to fill vacancies on our board of directors  and the requirement that stockholders holding at least of our voting stock are required to amend certain provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by laws relating to the number  term and election of our directors  the filling of board vacancies  stockholder notice procedures and the calling of special meetings of stockholders 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
we believe these provisions will protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors and by providing our board of directors with more time to assess any acquisition proposal 
these provisions are not intended to make our company immune from takeovers 
however  these provisions will apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and could delay or prevent an acquisition that our board of directors determines is not in the best interests of our company and our stockholders 
these provisions may also prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors

overview we are a global medical technology company with proven and industry leading products and services designed to measurably improve the safety  quality  efficiency and cost of healthcare 
we offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in the areas of medication management  infection prevention  operating room or effectiveness  respiratory care and surveillance and analytics 
our offerings include established brands used in hospitals throughout the united states and approximately countries worldwide 
our strategy is to enhance growth by focusing on healthcare safety and productivity  driving innovation and clinical differentiation  accelerating our global growth and pursuing strategic opportunities 
our primary customers in the united states include hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers  clinics  long term care facilities and physician offices 
for the fiscal years ended june  and  we generated revenue of billion and billion  respectively 
we generated income from continuing operations of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year approximately of our fiscal year revenue was from customers outside of the united states 
we were incorporated in delaware on january  for the purpose of holding the clinical and medical products businesses of cardinal health in anticipation of spinning off from cardinal health 
we completed the spinoff from cardinal health on august  we have incurred one time expenditures in connection with the separation from cardinal health capital and expense  primarily associated with employee related costs  costs to start up certain stand alone functions and information technology systems and other one time transaction related costs 
in fiscal years and  we incurred approximately million and million  respectively  of these one time expenditures 
we have funded these costs through cash from operations and cash on hand 
the capital portion of these expenditures is amortized over their useful lives and the other expenditures are expensed as incurred  depending on their nature 
we did not incur any expense associated with the separation in fiscal year  and we believe that all substantive expenditures associated with standing up operations from the spinoff are complete 
additionally  we have incurred increased costs as an independent  publicly traded company  primarily as a result of higher charges than in the past from cardinal health for transition services and from establishing or expanding the corporate support for our businesses  including information technology  human resources  treasury  tax  risk management  accounting and financial reporting  investor relations  legal  procurement and other services 
we believe cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these additional corporate expenses going forward 
factors affecting our results of operations the overall global economic environment  industry growth and trends healthcare related industries are generally less susceptible than some other industries to fluctuations in the overall economic environment 
however  some of our businesses rely on capital spending from our customers primarily hospitals  which can be influenced by a variety of economic factors  including interest rates  access to financing and endowment fluctuations 
significant changes in these economic factors can affect the sales of our 
table of contents capital equipment products  such as infusion pumps  dispensing equipment and ventilators 
additionally  sales volumes for some of our businesses are dependent on hospital admissions 
changes in admissions due to difficult economic times can affect our results for surgical and single use products  such as infusion and respiratory disposable sets  surgical instruments and skin antiseptic products 
healthcare providers globally are focused on reducing the rising costs to deliver care 
as a result  hospitals have prioritized and  in some cases  constrained their capital equipment purchases 
despite seeing some improvement during fiscal year  we continue to anticipate it will take time before significant market improvements are realized 
even in this environment  we believe our medical systems business is well positioned  and will strengthen with improvements in hospital capital equipment spending 
since  procedural volumes in acute care facilities have decreased  although procedural volumes have been relatively stable during fiscal year procedural volumes in acute care facilities represent one indicator for the demand of the disposable products sold within our procedural solutions operating segment 
in addition to procedural volumes  demand for many of our procedural solutions products is created when physicians convert their existing practices away from legacy methods and adopt our clinically differentiated products 
as a result  we believe our clinically differentiated product revenue has consistently outperformed trends in acute care facility procedural volumes 
healthcare reform we are also affected by uncertainties in the healthcare industry related to healthcare reform 
in march  comprehensive healthcare reform was enacted in the united states through the passage of the patient protection and affordable health care and the health care and education reconciliation acts 
among other initiatives  the legislation implemented a annual excise tax on the sales of certain medical devices in the united states  effective january as this excise tax is recorded as a selling  general and administrative expense  it has  and will continue to have  an adverse effect on our operating expenses and results of operations 
in fiscal year  we paid approximately million related to six months of the medical device tax 
we currently expect the impact of the tax to be approximately million to million in fiscal year and annually thereafter 
in addition  as the united states federal government implements additional provisions of healthcare reform  we anticipate that congress  regulatory agencies and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods with an objective of ultimately reducing healthcare costs and expanding access 
the uncertainties regarding the implementation and impact of the enacted healthcare reform measures  as well as other potential reform initiatives in the future  may have an adverse effect on our customers purchasing decisions regarding our products and services 
global restructuring during fiscal year our operations were impacted by our global restructuring program 
this program  announced in august the plan  was designed to reduce our cost structure and streamline operations  and was initially expected to result in a reduction of approximately positions 
the plan resulted in a reduction of approximately positions in fiscal this program provided operating expense savings of approximately million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of reducing headcount and eliminating unfilled positions 
of the million of savings  approximately million was a result of year over year savings in selling  general and administrative expense sg a and lower cost of sales expense  and million was a result of not filling open positions 
the final restructuring costs associated with the plan were million and were incurred as of june  innovation and new products our business strategy relies significantly on innovation to develop and introduce new products and to differentiate our products from our competitors 
our investment expense in research and development during 
table of contents fiscal year was million  or of revenues 
looking forward  we remain committed to producing a pipeline of innovative products to continue to support our growth strategies 
our internal and external investments will be focused on initiatives that we believe will offer the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability 
with a significant investment in research and development  a strong focus on innovation and a well managed innovation process  we believe we can continue to innovate and grow 
if  however  our future innovations are not successful in meeting customers needs or prove to be too costly versus their perceived benefit  our growth may slow 
international and foreign exchange we sell our products in approximately countries and manufacture our products in seven countries in north america  europe  and latin america 
due to the global nature of our business  our revenue and expenses are influenced by foreign exchange movements 
in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were in currencies other than the united states dollar 
increases or decreases in the value of the united states dollar compared to other currencies will affect our reported results as we translate those currencies into united states dollars 
the percentage of fiscal year sales by major currencies was as follows united states dollar euro british pound all other acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions have historically played a role in our growth  and we have made several significant acquisitions in the last five years 
our business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions by cardinal health of established healthcare companies  including the acquisition in of viasys healthcare inc viasys  a developer of respiratory care systems  and the acquisition in of the assets of enturia  inc enturia  a manufacturer of skin antiseptic products 
since our spinoff from cardinal health  we have taken steps to expand and refine our product offerings  including through the acquisitions and divestitures described below 
acquisitions date business may medegen  a manufacturer of clinically differentiated iv needleless access valves and administration sets  including our maxguard and maxplus products april vestara  a developer of technology solutions that enable the safe  efficient disposal and tracking of environmentally sensitive pharmaceutical waste august rowa  a german based company specializing in robotic medication storage and retrieval systems for retail and hospital pharmacies april phacts  a technology and consulting company that helps hospital pharmacies better manage inventory  reduce pharmaceutical costs  and streamline operations june uk medical holdings  a leading distributor of specialized medical products to the national health service and private healthcare sector in the united kingdom november intermed  a leading respiratory technologies company based in brazil

the value of this ipr d was calculated based on a discounted cash flow method  which involved a number of significant assumptions  including timing of product deployment  revenues  margin  and associated discount rates 
effective july   ipr d associated with business combinations is initially recorded in the balance sheet at fair value and tested for impairment annually until it is put into service 
prior to july   all acquired ipr d was expensed immediately 
see note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
the ipr d associated with medegen is related to certain products that are under development and are expected to be launched in the next one to two years 
completion of these products is subject to certain regulatory approvals and logistics surrounding manufacturing the end products cost effectively 
the value of this ipr d is reviewed for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value may not be recoverable 
product quality and recalls product quality  particularly in life saving and sustaining technologies  plays a critical role in our success 
a quality or safety issue may result in public warning letters  product recalls or seizures  monetary sanctions  consent decrees  injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products  civil or criminal sanctions  refusal of a government to grant clearances or approvals or delays in granting such clearances or approvals  import detentions of products made outside the united states  restrictions on operations or withdrawal or suspension of existing approvals 
any of the foregoing events could disrupt our business and have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  recalls may negatively affect sales due to customer concerns about product quality 
for the fiscal years ended june  and  net charges related to product recalls were not material 
for the fiscal year ended june   net charges related to product recalls were million 
we are operating under an amended consent decree with the fda related to our infusion pump business in the united states 
we entered into a consent decree with the fda in february related to our alaris se pumps  and in february  we and the fda amended the consent decree amended consent decree to include all infusion pumps manufactured by or for carefusion  inc  our subsidiary that manufactures and sells infusion pumps in the united states 
the amended consent decree does not apply to intravenous administration sets and accessories 
while we remain subject to the amended consent decree  which includes the requirements of the consent decree  we have made substantial progress in our compliance efforts 
in accordance with the consent decree  we reconditioned alaris se pumps that had been seized by the fda  remediated alaris se pumps in use by customers  and had an independent expert inspect the alaris se pump facilities and provide a certification to the fda as to compliance 
as result of these efforts  in january  we announced that the fda had given us permission to resume the manufacturing and marketing of our alaris se pumps 
in accordance with the amended 
table of contents consent decree  and in addition to the requirements of the original consent decree  we also implemented a corrective action plan to bring the alaris system and all other infusion pumps in use in the united states market into compliance  had our infusion pump facilities inspected by an independent expert  and had our recall procedures and all ongoing recalls involving our infusion pumps inspected by an independent recall expert 
in july  the fda notified us that we can proceed to the audit inspection phase of the amended consent decree  which includes the requirement to retain an independent expert to conduct periodic audits of our infusion pump facilities 
the amended consent decree authorizes the fda  in the event of any violations in the future  to order us to cease manufacturing and distributing  recall products and take other actions 
we may be required to pay damages of  per day per violation if we fail to comply with any provision of the amended consent decree  up to million per year 
we cannot currently predict the outcome of this matter  whether additional amounts will be incurred to resolve this matter  if any  or the matter s ultimate impact on our business 
as of june   we do not believe that a loss is probable in connection with the amended consent decree  and accordingly  we have no reserves associated with compliance with the amended consent decree 
as such  we may be obligated to pay more costs in the future because  among other things  the fda may determine that we are not fully compliant with the amended consent decree and therefore impose penalties under the amended consent decree  and or we may be subject to future proceedings and litigation relating to the matters addressed in the amended consent decree 
in response to infusion product recalls and the amended consent decree  we have made substantial investments in quality systems and quality personnel headcount over the past several years 
while we believe that we have made significant improvements to our product quality and overall quality systems  further quality concerns  whether real or perceived  could adversely affect our results 
conversely  improving quality can be a competitive advantage and improve our results 
infusion business and market developments our consolidated results have also been affected by developments within our infusion business and the infusion market in the united states 
for several months of fiscal year  we placed a hold on shipping the alaris system while we sought fda clearance for a software correction 
we received the required clearance in july  and we subsequently resumed shipments 
this shipping hold resulted in a negative impact on our infusion revenues in fiscal year when we released the shipping hold in july  we saw higher demand  which resulted in higher revenues for fiscal year because of safety concerns  the fda has increased its scrutiny of infusion pumps 
during fiscal year  three of our competitors recalled their infusion pumps to correct safety concerns 
in addition  a fourth was ordered by the fda to recall and destroy as many as  of its infusion pumps and to provide refunds to its customers or replace pumps at no cost 
as a result  there was increased demand for infusion pumps in the united states in fiscal year and  as healthcare providers sought to replace or upgrade their existing equipment 
we experienced increased demand for our infusion pumps as a result  which contributed to higher infusion revenues for fiscal year and in order to successfully compete in this business environment  we temporarily discounted the pricing on our infusion pumps  in some cases up to or more 
in late fiscal year  a competitor that recalled infusion pumps during fiscal year  recalled additional infusion pumps to correct safety concerns  and it announced that it would stop selling several of its infusion pumps in the united states and seek to retire its older pump technologies from the market 
as a result  we believe we may experience increased demand for our infusion pumps in the united states 
in order to maximize this potential opportunity  we may again temporarily discount the pricing on our infusion pumps  particularly if our competitors offer discounted or free pumps to customers 
income taxes prior to the spinoff  our operations were included in cardinal health s united states federal and state tax returns or non united states jurisdictions tax returns 
in connection with the spinoff  we and cardinal health entered into 
table of contents a tax matters agreement that governs the parties respective rights  responsibilities and obligations with respect to taxes 
the tax matters agreement generally provides that the control of audit proceedings and payment of any additional liability related to our business is our responsibility 
for the period july  through the spinoff date from cardinal health on august   our operations were included in the consolidated income tax returns of cardinal health  however  income taxes were calculated and provided for carefusion on a separate return basis for fiscal year commencing with the period beginning september   we began to file stand alone income tax returns in the united states federal jurisdiction  various united states state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions 
basis of presentation the audited consolidated financial statements reflect the consolidated operations of carefusion corporation and its subsidiaries as a separate  stand alone entity subsequent to august  periods presented prior to our august  spinoff from cardinal health have been prepared on a stand alone basis and are derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of cardinal health 
certain lines of business that manufacture and sell surgical and exam gloves  drapes and apparel and fluid management products in the united states markets that were historically managed by us prior to the spinoff and were part of the clinical and medical products business of cardinal health  were retained by cardinal health as a result of the spinoff and are presented in these financial statements as discontinued operations 
our consolidated financial statements do not necessarily reflect what the results of operations  financial position and cash flows would have been had we operated as an independent  publicly traded company during the periods prior to the spinoff from cardinal health 
leading up to our spinoff from cardinal health  we organized our business into two reportable segments critical care technologies and medical technologies and services 
during the quarter ended september   we realigned our business into two new global operating and reportable segments  medical systems and procedural solutions  in order to reduce complexity  provide clearer governance for our investments and make it easier for our customers to do business with us 
additionally  during the quarter ended september   we combined our respiratory diagnostics products with the respiratory technologies business line within the medical systems segment 
our respiratory diagnostics products had previously been reported within the procedural solutions segment as other 
financial information for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect these changes to our operating and reportable segments 
the medical systems segment is organized around our medical equipment business lines 
within the medical systems segment  we operate our dispensing technologies  infusion systems and respiratory technologies business lines 
the dispensing technologies business line includes equipment and related services for medication and supply dispensing 
the infusion systems business line includes infusion pumps and dedicated disposable infusion sets and accessories 
the respiratory technologies business line includes respiratory ventilators and dedicated disposable ventilator circuits and accessories  as well as our respiratory diagnostics products 
we also include our data mining surveillance service business within the medical systems segment  which we report as other 
the procedural solutions segment is organized around our disposable products business lines 
within the procedural solutions segment  we operate our infection prevention  medical specialties and specialty disposables business lines 
the infection prevention business line includes single use skin antiseptic and other patient preparation products and non dedicated disposable iv infusion administration sets and accessories 
the medical specialties business line includes interventional specialty products used for biopsy  drainage and other procedures  as well as reusable surgical instruments 
the specialty disposables business line includes non dedicated disposable ventilator circuits and oxygen masks used in respiratory therapy

table of contents revenue in our medical systems segment decreased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily a result of decreased revenues in the dispensing technologies million  infusion systems million  and respiratory technologies million business lines 
revenue in the dispensing technologies business line decreased million to million  primarily due to a decrease in the volume of equipment installations in advance of a new product release 
revenue in the infusion systems business line decreased million to million  primarily due to the net impact of a decrease in the volume of pump installations offset in part by an increase in equipment pricing and in dedicated disposable volumes 
revenue in the respiratory technologies business line decreased million to million as a result of continued constraints on hospital capital spending in the current year 
revenue in our procedural solutions segment increased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in procedural solutions revenue was due to growth in the medical specialties million  infection prevention million  and specialty disposables million business lines 
revenue in the infection prevention business line increased by million to million as a result of increased sales of skin preparation products and non dedicated infusion disposables 
revenue in the medical specialties business line increased by million to million primarily as a result of international expansion and continued strength in pleural drainage and biopsy categories 
increased revenue in the specialty disposables business line of million to million  is primarily attributable to an increase in demand as a result of a heavier flu season during the current year and increased distribution activities for bronchial hygiene products 
gross margin and cost of products sold gross margin increased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin was and for fiscal year and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin was primarily the result of infusion capital pricing improvements  manufacturing savings  and lower recall charges compared to prior year 
favorable manufacturing cost reductions had a positive impact on gross margin as a percentage of revenue 
manufacturing savings resulted from a cost benefits recognized through strategic sourcing of raw materials  b manufacturing efficiencies associated with lean transformation  and c reduced overhead spending 
selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses sg a and research and development expenses decreased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to savings associated with restructuring activities and a reduction in the amortization of intangible assets 
these decreases were partially offset by the onset of the new medical device excise tax that was implemented in fiscal year as part of the healthcare reform in the united states and the costs associated with the operations of intermed and uk medical 
r d expenses increased to million compared to the prior fiscal year as we continue to invest in next generation platforms primarily in each of our medical systems business lines 
restructuring and acquisition integration charges restructuring and acquisition integration charges decreased million to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
we periodically incur costs to implement smaller restructuring efforts for specific operations 
these restructuring plans focus on various aspects of operations  including closing and consolidating certain manufacturing operations  rationalizing headcount and aligning operations in the most strategic and cost efficient structure 

table of contents operating income operating income increased million  or  to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
segment profit in our medical systems segment increased million to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in segment profit was primarily driven by manufacturing costs savings  improved infusion capital pricing  lower recall charges compared to the prior year  and a reduction in sg a  offset by a increase in r d expenses 
segment profit in the procedural solutions segment increased million to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to increased gross margin and reductions in restructuring and acquisition integration charges as compared to the prior year

this decrease was primarily due to lower interest expenses associated with our senior debt 
provision for income taxes income tax expense increased by million to million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the effective tax rate for fiscal year was compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to changes in our business income mix by jurisdiction and an increase in tax expense as a result of the reserve for the expected government settlement accrued during the fiscal year ended june   a portion of which is not deductible 
we are currently before the irs appeals office for the fiscal years through  and we are engaged in substantive discussions with the irs appeals office related to our through fiscal years 
during the quarter ended june   we and cardinal health entered into a closing agreement with the irs to effectively settle the matters related to the transfer of intellectual property among our subsidiaries for fiscal years through we expect to resolve the remaining matters related to fiscal years through within the next twelve months 
during the quarter ended september   we commenced the tax audit for the fiscal years and and the short period july  through august  as part of cardinal health s tax audit of its federal consolidated returns for fiscal years through during the quarter ended december   the irs commenced the tax audit for the short period september  through june  furthermore  during the quarter ended june   the irs commenced the tax audit for fiscal year we believe that we have provided adequate contingent tax reserves for these matters 
however  if upon the conclusion of these audits  the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves  our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment

table of contents revenue in our medical systems segment increased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
revenue increased largely as a result of increased sales of million and million for our dispensing technologies and infusion systems business lines  respectively 
revenue in our dispensing technologies business line increased million primarily as a result of new business from competitive displacements  increased renewals and upgrades from existing customers  and the year over year impact of our acquisition of rowa million 
revenue in our infusion systems business line increased million as a result of organic business growth in both capital and dedicated disposable products and continued sales growth and demand for our infusion pumps 
revenue in our procedural solutions segment decreased by to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the revenue decrease is primarily attributable to decreased revenues from the specialty disposables business line million and the impact of the sale of the onsite services business  which had million in sales in the prior year 
these decreases were partially offset by year over year growth in our infection prevention business line million 
gross margin and cost of products sold gross margin increased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenue  gross margin was and for fiscal year and  respectively 
the overall increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher sales associated with our infusion systems and dispensing technologies business lines 
margin as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily as a result of temporarily discounting the pricing on our infusion pumps 
during fiscal  a large infusion pump manufacturer was required to remove one of its product lines from the market in connection with a fda recall 
in order to successfully compete in this business environment  we temporarily discounted the pricing on our infusion pumps  in some cases up to or more 
selling  general and administrative and research and development expenses sg a and research and development expenses decreased to  million compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sg a expenses million primarily related to lower one time costs associated with our spinoff from cardinal health incurred in fiscal year compared to costs incurred in the prior fiscal year million  and partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses million

loss from discontinued operations  net of tax loss from discontinued operations  net of tax totaled million for fiscal year compared to loss from discontinued operations of million for fiscal year the increase is a result of a loss from the disposal of the nicolet business  which we classified as discontinued operations during fiscal year and divested in july additionally  included in discontinued operations in the prior year are results from the international surgical products business  which was sold on april  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to these discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources overview historically  we have generated  and expect to continue to generate  positive cash flow from operations 
cash flows from operations primarily represent inflows from net income adjusted for depreciation and other non cash items and outflows from investment in sales type leases entered into  as we sell and install dispensing equipment  and other increases in working capital needed to grow the business 
cash flows from investing activities represent our investment in intellectual property and capital equipment required to grow our business  as well as acquisitions 
cash flows from financing activities primarily represent net proceeds from debt issuance  settlement of long term borrowings  and outflows related to the share repurchase program  as discussed below 
our cash balance at june  was  million 
of this balance   million is held outside of the united states and is denominated in united states dollars as well as other currencies 
in august  we used million of our cash balances to repay upon maturity million of our outstanding senior notes 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that our current domestic cash flow from operations and domestic cash balances are sufficient to meet domestic operating needs 
it is our intention to indefinitely reinvest all current and future foreign earnings in order to ensure sufficient working capital and expand existing operations outside the united states 
additionally  we intend to fund foreign acquisitions primarily through the use of unrepatriated cash held by foreign subsidiaries 
however  should our domestic cash needs exceed our current or future domestic cash flows  we could repatriate foreign cash or utilize our senior unsecured revolving credit facility  both of which would result in increased expense 
we believe that our future cash from operations together with our access to funds available under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the capital markets will provide adequate resources to fund both short term and long term operating requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new business development activities 
in february  we announced that our board of directors had approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our common stock through open market and private transactions 
this share repurchase program was completed in june under this program  we repurchased a 
table of contents total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million excluding commissions and fees during the fiscal year ended june  and a total of million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million excluding commissions and fees as of june  in august  we announced that our board of directors had approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
under this program  we are authorized to repurchase our shares in open market and private transactions through december we expect to manage the pace of repurchases under this program based on market conditions and other relevant factors  and we currently intend to complete approximately million of repurchases authorized by this program in fiscal sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows from continuing operations for the fiscal years ended june    and fiscal year ended june  in millions cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities fiscal years ended june  and june  net operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased million to million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily associated with trade receivables  which contributed a year over year reduction in cash flow of million 
this decrease is attributable to stabilization achieved during fiscal year in the accounts receivable portfolio as compared to the fiscal year domestic and international collection efforts 
additionally  a decrease in cash flows within operating assets and liabilities  including accounts payable  and other accrued liabilities and other operating items resulted in a cash flow decrease of million 
these decreases in cash flow were offset by an increase in income from continuing operations  adjusted for the impact of non cash items  of million  and an increase in cash flow resulting from changes in inventories and sales type leases of million 
net cash used in continuing operations from investing activities decreased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in amounts paid for acquisitions of million offset by a decrease in amounts received for divestitures of million 
further  activities associated with long lived asset investments resulted in a decrease in cash outflows of million 
net cash used in continuing operations from financing activities increased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
this increase is largely due to the share repurchase program  which increased to million  compared to million of repurchase activities during fiscal year additionally  there was an increase in cash used in the repayment of senior notes million upon maturity in august these increases in cash used were offset by receipt of net proceeds from the march issuance of senior notes million and an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises  net of shares withheld for tax purposes million as compared to the prior year 
fiscal years ended june  and june  net operating cash flow from continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the impact of cash inflows associated with trade receivables of million  which is attributable to improved collections as a result of system 
table of contents stabilization gained post implementation and increased focus on collections from customers in europe 
an increase in income from continuing operations of million also impacted the increase in operating cash flow at june  additionally  activities within operating assets and liabilities  including inventories  accounts payable  sales type leases  other accrued liabilities and other operating items  contributed to an increase in cash flow of million from the prior year 
these increases in cash flow were offset by decreases in cash flow from the impact of non cash items of million 
net cash used in continuing operations from investing activities increased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in amounts paid for acquisitions of million and a decrease in amounts received for divestitures of million 
during the year ended june   we completed the acquisitions of rowa  phacts and uk medical holdings 
the increase in cash paid for acquisitions was offset by a decrease in cash outflows associated with long lived asset investment activities of million 
net cash used in continuing operations from financing activities increased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
this increase is largely due to initiation of the share repurchase program  which resulted in an increase in cash outflow of million compared to the prior year 
further  net cash transferred through discontinued operations resulted in a decrease of million compared to prior years discontinued operation activities 
the remaining decrease of million is the result of other financing activities 
capital resources senior unsecured notes 
in july  we sold billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and received net proceeds of billion the july notes 
in august  we used million in cash to repay upon maturity the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and received net proceeds of approximately million the march notes 
accordingly  we have billion of senior notes outstanding  as follows million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the indenture for the senior notes limits our ability to incur certain secured debt and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions 
in accordance with the indenture  we may redeem the senior notes prior to maturity at a price that would equal or exceed the outstanding principal balance  as defined 
in addition  if we undergo a change of control and experience a below investment grade rating event  we may be required to repurchase all of the senior notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal balance plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in connection with the issuance of the july notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec to conduct an exchange offer for the notes 
in accordance with the registration rights agreement  we filed a form s with the sec and conducted an exchange offer for the july notes  which we completed on february  the purpose of the exchange offer was to allow the holders of the july notes  which were issued in a private placement transaction and were subject to transfer restrictions  to exchange their notes for new notes that did not have these restrictions and are registered under the securities act 
all of the outstanding july notes were exchanged in the exchange offer 
in connection with the issuance of the march notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the notes pursuant to which we agreed to file a registration statement with the sec to conduct an exchange offer for the notes 
under this registration rights agreement  we have until march  to file a registration statement with the sec for the march notes 

table of contents revolving credit facility 
in july  we entered into a five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility with an aggregate available principal amount of million 
effective as of december   we increased the aggregate commitments available under the credit facility from million to million  pursuant to the exercise of the accordion feature under the credit facility 
at june   we had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on july  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum based upon the british bankers association libor rate or the alternate base rate  in each case plus an applicable margin  which varies based upon carefusion s debt ratings 
the credit facility also requires us to pay a quarterly commitment fee to the lenders under the credit facility on the amount of the lender s unused commitments thereunder based upon carefusion s debt ratings 
the credit facility contains several customary covenants including  but not limited to  limitations on liens  subsidiary indebtedness  dispositions  and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the credit facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of no more than as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters  and a consolidated interest coverage ratio of at least as of the end of any period of four fiscal quarters 
the credit facility is subject to customary events of default  including  but not limited to  non payment of principal or other amounts when due  breach of covenants  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  cross default to other material indebtedness  certain erisa related events  certain voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy events  and change of control 
dividends we currently intend to retain any earnings to finance research and development  acquisitions and the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we use our excess cash to fund our share repurchase program 
the declaration and payment of any dividends in the future by us will be subject to the sole discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements of our operating subsidiaries  covenants associated with certain of our debt obligations  legal requirements  regulatory constraints and other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
moreover  should we pay any dividend in the future  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends 
contractual obligations as of june   our contractual obligations  including estimated payments due by fiscal year  are as follows payments due by fiscal year in millions thereafter total long term debt other long term liabilities interest on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total financial obligations represents maturities of our long term debt obligations  excluding capital lease obligations described below  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
amounts are presented gross of debt issuance discounts of million at june  represents cash outflows by period for certain of our long term liabilities in which cash outflows could be reasonably estimated 
certain long term liabilities  such as unrecognized tax benefits of million and deferred taxes of million  tax associated accruals of million  deferred compensation obligations of 
table of contents million and other long term liabilities of million  have been excluded from the table above because of the inherent uncertainty of the underlying tax positions or because of the inability to reasonably estimate the timing of any cash outflow 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest obligation is calculated based on each outstanding debt stated or coupon rate  or existing variable rate as of june   as applicable 
represents minimum rental payments and the related estimated future interest payments for operating leases having initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms  including the following fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the maximum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur 
purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table 
in addition  contracts that can be unilaterally cancelled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period 
in addition to the contractual obligations set forth above  we expect that we will make payments to the irs related to ongoing appeals of prior tax years under audit 
we are currently before the irs appeals office for fiscal years through in addition  we have commenced federal income tax audits for fiscal years through we believe that we have provided adequate reserves for these matters 
however  if upon the conclusion of these audits  the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount that is materially different than our current reserves  our overall tax expense and effective tax rate may be materially impacted in the period of adjustment 
further  even if we are adequately reserved for these matters  final settlement would require us to make a cash payment to the irs  which could be material 
if we determine to repatriate foreign cash or utilize our revolving credit facility to fund the payment to the irs  it may result in increased costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
off balance sheet arrangements at june   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies and sensitive accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant effect on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and require use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience  trends  and management s judgment 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and believe our estimates to be reasonable 
other companies applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies applied in preparing our audited consolidated financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions 
for additional accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we generate revenue through the sale and lease of equipment  software  services  medical products  supplies  and the income associated with the financing of our equipment leases 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  product delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends on a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our obligations 
determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized may involve subjective or complex judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable  but actual results may differ from our estimates 
the significant judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive and could result in material differences under other assumptions and conditions are those described below 
evaluation of the significance of embedded software we sell and lease products with embedded software 
we regularly review these products to determine whether embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole 
if the embedded software is more than incidental to the product as a whole  the product is classified as a software product unless it is determined that the tangible elements and software elements of the product work together to deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole 
we consider the following characteristics to be indicators that embedded software is more than incidental to the product as whole software is a significant focus of the marketing effort or the software application is sold separately  significant internally developed software costs have been incurred  and if we provide telephone support  bug fixes  and or unspecified upgrades specific to the embedded software 
the evaluation process is often complex and subject to significant judgment as the products exhibit varying degrees of the indicators identified above  such as certain products are marketed as systems or solutions wherein it is implied  but not explicitly stated within marketing and sales collateral  that embedded software provides the basis for significant functionalities identified within the marketing efforts  internal software development costs are incurred during the product development process  separately priced extended warranty services provide post installation support relative to repair parts and services and also include telephone support and bug fixes for the software embedded within the products  and we are required by law to provide medical safety related bug fixes for products with embedded software elements 
in evaluating whether the tangible elements and software elements of the product together deliver the essential functionality of the product as a whole  we consider the following factors the frequency with which tangible elements are sold separately from the software elements  and whether the non software elements substantively contribute to the essential functionality of the product 

table of contents although we believe the software embedded within our infusion products  when sold with safety software  patient identification products  and certain diagnostic equipment is more than incidental to the product as a whole  the tangible elements and software elements work together to deliver the essential functionality of these products as a whole and therefore these products are not classified as software 
we have determined the embedded software within our other products  primarily our dispensing and respiratory products  is incidental to the products as a whole 
those products are therefore not classified as software 
generally  we classify our stand alone software application sales and any related post contract support related to these sales as software 
revenue recognition for leases we evaluate our lease transactions to determine the classification of the leases against the following criteria the lease transfers ownership of the property to the lessee by the end of the lease term  there is a bargain purchase option  the lease term is equal to or greater than of the economic life of the equipment  or the present value of the minimum lease payments are equal to or greater than of the fair market value of the equipment at the inception of the lease 
if a lease meets at least one of the criteria above and collectability of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable and there are no important uncertainties surrounding the amount of unreimbursable costs yet to be incurred under the lease  the lease is classified as a sales type lease 
all other leases are classified as operating leases 
the economic life of our leased products is the estimated remaining period during which the capital equipment products are expected to be economically usable by one or more users  with normal repairs and maintenance  for the purpose for which they were intended at the lease inception  without limitation by the lease term 
the value of our products is driven principally by their technological features and is subject to obsolescence due to advancements in technological features of next generation models 
we consider the economic life of our technology dependent capital equipment products to be five years based on the anticipated future technological advances of our products or that of our competitors 
additionally  five years represents the most frequent contractual lease term for our technology dependent principal products and virtually none of our leases are for original terms longer than five years 
our product configurations are customized for each customer s specific specifications  and there is no significant after market for our used equipment and the equipment is not re leased upon return 
upon return of the leased products  they are broken down and certain parts are reclaimed  but most of the parts are scrapped or discarded 
thus  we believe five years is representative of the period during which the technology dependent products are expected to be economically usable at the inception of the lease 
residual values  if any  are established at lease inception using estimates of the fair value of reclaimable component parts of the products at the end of the lease term 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our leased products for the purposes of lease classification and determination of the interest rate implicit in the lease 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification topic  leases asc  we define the fair value of a leased product at lease inception as its normal selling price  reflecting any volume or trade discounts that may apply 
we estimate the fair value of our leased products on a quarterly basis based upon transacted cash sales prices during the preceding twelve month period 
our products are sold as part of customized systems to a diverse range of customers  many of which are affiliated with a gpo or idn 
customers within each gpo or idn affiliation have unique purchasing behaviors and characteristics 
as a result of such diversity  there is a wide range of negotiated cash selling prices for our products 
consequently  our customers are grouped in customer classes and a best estimate of fair value is developed for each product specific to each customer class 
because our products are sold at a wide range of cash selling prices  we stratify our cash selling transactions based on product 
table of contents configuration and customer class  as discussed further below 
once we stratify our cash selling transactions  we calculate the weighted average selling price of each configured product using the interquartile range methodology 
this statistical methodology is used to remove outliers from the population of normal cash selling prices  which narrows the range of selling prices within each stratified customer class 
the resulting weighted average selling price is the single point estimate of fair value that we use as the normal selling price under asc based on this fair value estimate  we determine the implicit interest rate for each product subject to a sales type lease arrangement 
the implicit interest rate is the rate that causes the fair value of the product to equal the present value of the minimum lease payments and the present value of the product s residual value 
the interest rate implicit to the lease is then used to determine the amount of revenue recognized at the inception of the lease and the revenue recognized over the life of the lease 
estimating the fair value of our leased products can be subjective and thus subject to significant judgment 
we offer our customers many types of dispensing products  each of which is generally customizable in unique configurations 
our customers have the option of purchasing these products for cash or through a lease  with prices that can vary significantly based on their gpo or idn affiliation 
accordingly  in order to estimate the fair value of our leased products  we stratify our cash selling transactions to narrow the range of transacted sales prices for a leased product based on product configuration and customer class 
we believe that using these characteristics to narrow the range of cash selling prices to determine a single point estimate of fair value for each product  specific to each customer class  is appropriate because these characteristics are the primary drivers of the variability in our cash sales pricing product configuration we believe that stratifying our products based on product configuration is appropriate because our products can be customized into numerous configurations based on customer specifications 
our dispensing systems are highly configurable and custom designed for each customer based on size  site specific needs and cost constraints 
customer class we stratify our cash selling prices of similar product configurations by similar classes of customers based upon gpo or idn affiliation 
we believe the characteristics of the gpo or idn  including size  historical and expected purchasing volume  pre negotiated trade discounts  and preferred provider relationship  is an appropriate basis to stratify transacted cash selling prices to establish the normal selling price reflective of any normal volume or trade discounts for that product configuration 
approximately of our lease transactions in a given year do not have corresponding cash selling transactions for the same product configuration and customer class 
therefore  for these transactions  the estimated fair value is determined by reviewing the estimated fair value of the same product line with the closest similar configuration sold to the same customer class and adjusting this fair value by the expected pricing impact of the difference in product configuration  or reviewing the estimated fair value of the same product configuration sold to a different customer class and adjusting this fair value by the expected pricing impact of the difference in customer class 
we expect to experience variability in our fair value estimates for our dispensing products from period to period 
our single point estimate of fair value is calculated based on the weighted average selling price for a product within each stratified customer class 
consequently  period to period variability of such estimate may be caused by changes in the number and size of cash transactions for a particular product or group of products  as well as external factors such as changes in the competitive pricing environment and changes in the gpo or idn landscape  which can impact our cash sales transactions and thus our calculated estimates of fair value 
in addition  as our dispensing products progress through their life cycles and new products are introduced  we may sell fewer existing products or sell existing products at reduced prices  which can impact the cash transaction prices used to estimate the fair value of such products 

table of contents multiple element arrangements the majority of our transactions qualify as multiple element arrangements 
we use the relative selling price method to allocate contract proceeds to non software products  which are then individually recognized to revenue 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or management s estimated selling price if neither vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence is available 
the determination of vendor specific objective evidence associated with our products and services is generally based on historical evidence of sales of the same product in stand alone transactions and the contract renewal prices for post contract support and separately priced extended warranty services 
the determination of third party evidence is generally based on market data on sales of similar products and services  if available  however in most cases we and our competitors execute large multiple element arrangements which reduces our ability to determine the prices for individual products and services 
management s best estimate of selling price is developed consistent with the price at which we would transact if the deliverable were sold by us regularly on a stand alone basis 
in determining estimated selling price  we generally consider the following stand alone sales prices  established price lists  costs to produce  profit margins for similar products  market conditions  and customer stratification 
for software and software related products  we use the relative fair value method to allocate contract proceeds to each unit of accounting  whereby the evidence used in the determination of fair value estimates are based solely on vendor specific objective evidence 
to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for delivered elements of the transaction  we apply the residual method 
different conclusions as to selling price estimates may significantly affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition  the classification of leasing transactions  and the classification of revenue as product  service  rental or other income 
it is impossible to determine the effects of potential different conclusions as they relate to selling price estimates for components of our multiple element arrangements 
business combinations assumptions and estimates are used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
a significant portion of the purchase price in many of our acquisitions is assigned to intangible assets  which requires management to use significant judgment in determining fair value 
current and future amortization expense for such intangibles is affected by purchase price allocations and by the assessment of estimated useful lives of such intangibles  excluding goodwill 
we believe the assets recorded and the useful lives established are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
in conjunction with the review of a transaction  the status of the acquired company s research and development projects is assessed to determine the existence of ipr d 
in connection with certain acquisitions  we are required to estimate the fair value of acquired ipr d  which requires selecting an appropriate discount rate and estimating future cash flows for each project 
management also assesses the current status of development  nature and timing of efforts to complete such development  uncertainties and other factors when estimating the fair value 
costs are not assigned to ipr d unless future development is probable 
ipr d is recorded as an unamortized intangible asset until the underlying products are either completed and put into service  which would require commencing amortization over the estimated product life  or determining the products will not complete development  which would require impairing the portion of ipr d associated with that product 
until either determination is made  ipr d is subject to periodic impairment review  with impairments  if any  expensed to our consolidated statement of income 
during fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of medegen  which resulted in approximately million of ipr d associated with new products under development being recorded as an intangible asset 
the timing and recognition of both the in service date for these products as well as the potential of impairment involves significant judgment 

table of contents goodwill and other intangibles goodwill is the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities assumed in the business combination 
purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest impairment exists 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we conduct our goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level which is comprised of our medical systems and procedural solutions operating segments  as the business lines comprising each of the operating segments service a common group of customers  offer complementary products  and share a common strategy 
in conducting the annual impairment test of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  an optional qualitative assessment may be performed 
if the results of this qualitative assessment indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is not less than its carrying amount  then no further quantitative testing is required 
otherwise  the calculated fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill by performing the quantitative impairment test 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  then no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to assess impairment 
there are no active or inactive markets for our reporting units or indefinite lived intangible assets to derive approximate fair values  and accordingly  the valuation process is similar to the valuation of a closely held company or acquired indefinite lived intangible asset and considers valuation methods that are income based and market based 
our income based approach is a discounted cash flow method which utilizes an estimated discount rate to the projected after tax cash flows for the reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset 
our market based approach utilizes an estimated market based multiple to the reporting units estimated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the results of the income based and market based approaches are equally weighted to arrive at the total estimated fair value for each reporting unit for the purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing 
based on our annual impairment test as of the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  we did not record any goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible asset impairments 
the application of valuation methods requires significant judgment regarding appropriate inputs and assumptions and results in our best estimate of the fair value of an operating segment 
as with any estimate  inputs and assumptions can be subject to varying degrees of uncertainty 
informed market participants can differ in their perception of value for a reporting unit 
it is possible that one of our operating segments could experience goodwill impairment in the future 
restructuring and acquisition integration charges we separately identify restructuring and acquisition integration charges in sg a expenses 
a restructuring activity is a program whereby we fundamentally change our operations such as closing facilities  moving a product to another location or outsourcing the production of a product 
restructuring activities may also involve substantial re alignment of the management structure of a business line in response to changing market conditions 
acquisition integration charges are activities and costs to integrate acquired companies into the operations of our existing activities  including such functions as selling  manufacturing  information systems  and corporate related functions 
the majority of the charges related to restructuring and acquisition integration can be classified in one of the following categories employee related costs  exit costs including lease termination costs  asset impairments  and other integration costs 
employee related costs include severance and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease 
table of contents agreements less estimated sublease income 
other facility exit costs include costs to move equipment or inventory out of a facility as well as other costs incurred to shut down a facility 
asset impairment costs include the reduction in value of our assets as a result of the integration or restructuring activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
provision for income taxes prior to august   our income taxes as presented are calculated on a separate tax return basis  although our operations were historically included in cardinal health s united states federal and state tax returns or non united states jurisdictions tax returns 
cardinal health s global tax model was developed based on its entire portfolio of businesses 
accordingly  our tax results for periods prior to august  are not necessarily reflective of the results that we would have generated on a stand alone basis 
our income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and measurement of uncertain tax positions reflect management s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements 
the proper treatment of various tax issues  including transfer pricing  are subjective determinations that depend on the specific facts and circumstances at issue 
to estimate contingent tax reserves  management first concludes whether our positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
the reserve is then determined by evaluating and weighing the technical merits of alternative methodologies against each other and concluding on the positions that provide the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
to the extent there are any administrative or case law developments that provide additional evidence in favor or against the valuation methodologies utilized  the contingent tax reserve will be adjusted in the period that such developments occur 
loss contingencies we accrue for contingencies related to litigation and other claims arising out of our business based on degree of probability and range of possible loss 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
because these claims are often inherently unpredictable and unfavorable resolutions could occur  assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events 
we regularly review contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures 
the amount of ultimate loss may differ from these estimates 
share based compensation we maintain a stock incentive plan that provides for awards of non qualified and incentive stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance stock units for the benefit of certain of our officers  directors and employees 
at the time of the spinoff  cardinal health converted or adjusted outstanding stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units collectively  share based awards with respect to cardinal health common shares held by cardinal health and carefusion employees 
the manner of conversion for each employee was determined based on the date of the original share based award and the employment status of the employee at the spinoff date of august  we are responsible for fulfilling all share based awards related to our common stock  and cardinal health is responsible for fulfilling all share based awards related to cardinal health common shares  regardless of whether the employee holding the share based award is an employee of the company or cardinal health 
we record share based compensation expense for the share based awards with the offsetting impact recorded to additional paid in capital in our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of stock options granted by the company during the fiscal years ended june    and was valued utilizing a black scholes merton valuation model 
in addition  for performance stock units granted during fiscal year  which are subject to performance goals based on market conditions associated with stock price appreciation  we estimate fair value by utilizing a monte carlo valuation model 

table of contents our estimate of fair value depends on a complex process that requires the estimation of future uncertain events 
these events  estimates of which are entered within the valuation model include  but are not limited to  stock price volatility  the expected life  expected dividend yield and forfeiture rates 
once fair values are determined  current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed  even if the estimates used in the valuation model are different from actual results 
we are required to compare our estimated share based forfeiture rates to actual forfeiture rates and record any adjustments as necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding share based compensation including the valuation process 
new accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on our results of operations  financial positions and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we seek to manage these risks using hedging strategies that involve the use of derivative instruments 
we do not enter into any derivative agreements for trading or speculative purposes 
while we believe we have designed an effective risk management program  there are inherent limitations in our ability to forecast our exposures  and therefore  we cannot guarantee that our programs will completely mitigate all risks associated with unfavorable movement in either foreign exchange rates or interest rates 
additionally  the timing of the recognition of gains and losses related to derivative instruments can be different from the recognition of the underlying economic exposure 
this may impact our consolidated operating results and financial position 
interest rate risk interest income and expense on variable rate instruments are sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates across the world 
changes in interest rates primarily affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and to a significantly lesser extent the interest expense on our debt 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk by using derivative instruments such as swaps with financial institutions to hedge our risks on a portion of our probable future debt issuances 
in general  we may hedge material interest rate exposures up to several years before the forecasted transaction  however  we may choose not to hedge some exposures for a variety of reasons including prohibitive economic costs 
to the extent that forward interest rate swap agreements qualify for hedge accounting  the gain loss will be recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci and reclassified into earnings in the same line item associated with the forecasted transaction and in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in earnings immediately 
the notional amount of forward interest rate swap derivative instruments outstanding was million and million as of june  and june   respectively  with an estimated fair value gain of approximately million and an estimated fair value loss of million  as of june  and june   respectively 
the agreements require us to make payments based on fixed interest rates and receive payments based on variable benchmark libor interest rates 
as of june  and june   substantially all of our outstanding debt balances are fixed rate debt 
while changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on this debt  interest on any borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be exposed to interest rate fluctuations as the rate on this facility is variable 
at both june  and june   there were no outstanding amounts under our five year senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
in august  we used million of our cash balances to 
table of contents repay upon maturity million of our outstanding senior notes 
in march  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of approximately million

fixed rate notes are presented gross of million and million purchase discount at june  and june   respectively 
the estimated fair value of our long term obligations and other short term borrowings was  million and  million at june  and june   respectively 
the fair value of our senior notes at june  and was based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of the other obligations at june  and june   was based on either the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt and the current interest rates offered for debt or estimated based on discounted cash flows 
foreign currency risk we are a global company with operations in multiple countries and are a net recipient of currencies other than the united states dollar usd 
accordingly  a strengthening of the usd will negatively impact revenues and gross margins expressed in consolidated usd terms 
currently  we have foreign exchange risk associated with currency exposure related to existing assets and liabilities  committed transactions  forecasted future cash flows and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
we seek to manage our foreign exchange risk by using derivative instruments such as forwards  swaps and options with financial institutions to hedge our risks 
in general  we may hedge material foreign exchange exposures up 
table of contents to twelve months in advance  however  we may choose not to hedge some exposures for a variety of reasons including prohibitive economic costs 
the realized and unrealized gains and losses of foreign currency forward contracts and the re measurement of foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and loans are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
to the extent that cash flow hedges qualify for hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the forward contract will be recorded to aoci 
as the forecasted exposures affect earnings  the realized gain or loss on the forward contract will be moved from aoci to the consolidated statements of income 
the following table provides information about our foreign currency derivative instruments outstanding as of june  and june  june  june  in millions notional amount average contract rate notional amount average contract rate foreign currency forward contracts receive usd pay foreign currency euro australian dollar new zealand dollar south african rand mexico peso canadian dollar swiss franc japanese yen british pound hong kong dollar total estimated fair value foreign currency forward contracts pay usd receive foreign currency mexican peso euro indian rupee swiss franc british pound total estimated fair value foreign currency forward contracts pay foreign currency receive euros british pound total estimated fair value commodity price risk management we purchase commodities such as resins  printed circuit boards  latex  metals  various fuel products and polystyrene  among others for use in our manufacturing processes 
we typically purchase these commodities at market prices  and as a result are affected by market price fluctuations 
we have decided not to hedge these exposures as they are deemed immaterial
