item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital adequacy 
bank holding company regulation under the federal reserve guidelines  every bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for each of their bank subsidiaries 
the bank holding company is expected to commit resources to support a subsidiary bank  including at times when the holding company may not be in a financial position to provide such support 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the federal reserve s regulations  or both 
the source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies in situations where the bank holding company s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels 
this doctrine was codified by the dodd frank act  but the federal reserve board has not yet adopted regulations to implement this requirement 
the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act  limits the investments and activities of bank holding companies 
in general  a bank holding company is prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  providing services for its subsidiaries  and various non bank activities that are deemed to be closely related to banking 
the activities of the company are subject to these legal and regulatory limitations under the bank holding company act and the implementing regulations of the federal reserve board 
federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiary  if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
currently  bankcap partners is deemed a bank holding company for atlantic capital bank and the bank 
the position of bankcap partners as a source of strength to other depository institutions may limit its ability to serve as a source of strength for the bank and could adversely affect the bank s ability to access resources of bankcap partners 
federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiary  if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
a bank for which bankcap partners is deemed to be a bank holding company may be required to indemnify  or cross guarantee  the fdic against losses the fdic incurs with respect to any other bank controlled by bankcap partners 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation act of requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated by the fdic arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default 
accordingly  the bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to atlantic capital bank or any other financial institution for which bankcap partners is deemed to be a bank holding company 
atlantic capital bank is a georgia state non member bank headquartered in atlanta  georgia that was founded in atlantic capital bank operates as a full service  locally managed commercial bank that specifically targets the financial needs of middle market corporations  emerging growth companies  real estate developers and investors  and the principals of these companies  as well as affluent families

table of contents prompt corrective action immediately upon becoming undercapitalized  a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of section of the fdia  which a restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees  b require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital  c require submission of a capital restoration plan  d restrict the growth of the institution s assets  and e require prior approval of certain expansion proposals 
the appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions  if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long term cost to the dif  subject in certain cases to specified procedures 
these discretionary supervisory actions include a requiring the institution to raise additional capital  b restricting transactions with affiliates  c requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser  and d any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate 
these and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions 
any bank holding company that controls a subsidiary bank that has been required to submit a capital restoration plan will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan  subject to limitations on the bank holding company s aggregate liability in connection with providing such required assurances 
failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank being placed into receivership  if it becomes critically undercapitalized 
a bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent holding company in other ways 
these include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends or subordinated debt payments to the parent holding company by the bank  as well as limitations on other transactions between the bank and the parent holding company 
in addition  the federal reserve may impose restrictions on the ability of the bank holding company itself to pay dividends  or require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the subsidiary bank  or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
basel iii on december   the basel committee on banking supervision the basel committee proposed significant changes to bank capital and liquidity regulation  including revisions to the definitions of tier capital and tier capital applicable to basel committee s revised framework for the international convergence of capital management and capital standards basel iii 
on september   the oversight body of the basel committee announced a package of reforms that will increase existing capital requirements substantially over the next four years 
these capital reforms were endorsed by the g in november in september  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital and total capital ratios  in amounts equal to  and of risk weighted assets  respectively  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer of of risk weighted assets 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a counter cyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 
on june   the us banking agencies requested comment on three proposed rules that  taken together  would establish an integrated regulatory capital framework implementing the basel iii regulatory capital reforms in the us as proposed  the us implementation of basel iii would lead to significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios than those currently in place 
once adopted  these new capital requirements would be phased in over time 
additionally  the us implementation of basel iii contemplates that  for banking organizations with less than billion in assets  the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier capital would be phased out over a year period 
comments to the proposed rules were requested by september  in order to begin the gradual integration of the proposed rules on january  however  us banking agencies have delayed implementation of the proposed rules as they continue weighing views expressed during the comment period 
the ultimate impact of the us implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed 
at this point  we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any final regulations  if enacted  would have upon our earnings or financial position 
in addition  important questions remain as to how the numerous capital and liquidity mandates of the dodd frank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii 

table of contents dodd frank act the dodd frank act was signed by president obama in july the dodd frank act will result in a major overhaul of the current financial institution regulatory system 
a summary of certain provisions of the dodd frank act is set forth below  along with information set forth in the applicable sections of this supervision and regulation section 
among other things  the dodd frank act establishes a new  independent consumer financial protection bureau tasked with protecting american consumers from unfair  deceptive and abusive financial products and practices 
the dodd frank act also creates the financial stability oversight council  which focuses on identifying  monitoring and addressing systemic risks in the financial system 
the financial stability oversight council  among other tasks  makes recommendations for increasingly strict rules for capital  leverage and other requirements as a company s size and complexity increase 
the dodd frank act also requires the implementation of the volcker rule for banks and bank holding companies  which prohibits  with certain limited exceptions  proprietary trading  investment in and sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity funds  and generally otherwise limits the relationships with such funds 
the dodd frank act also includes provisions that  among other things  reorganize bank supervision and strengthen the federal reserve 
the dodd frank act includes savings associations and industrial loan companies  as well as banks  in the nationwide deposit limitation 
thus  no acquisition of any financial institution  not just a commercial bank  can be approved if the effect of the acquisition would be to increase the acquirer s nationwide deposits to more than of all deposits 
the dodd frank act also requires fees charged for debit card transactions to be both reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the card issuer 
further  the dodd frank act provides that the appropriate federal regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other covered financial institution that provides an insider or other employee with excessive compensation or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm 
in june  prior to the dodd frank act  the bank regulatory agencies promulgated the interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation policies  which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the impact of activities to achieve incentive compensation with the related risk to the financial institution of such behavior 
in february  federal banking and securities regulators released proposed regulations that set forth standards for incentive based compensation that prohibit compensation considered to be excessive or encourage risk that could result in a material financial loss 
while the proposed regulation applies only to covered financial institutions  meaning those institutions with billion or more in assets  the proposal rests on principles set forth in the dodd frank act and the interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation policies 
accordingly  we anticipate that federal banking regulators will apply certain of those standards to all financial institutions in determining whether they are in compliance with the guidance on sound incentive compensation policies  so that  together with the dodd frank act and the recent guidance  the proposed rules may impact the current compensation policies at the bank 
the collins amendment was incorporated into the dodd frank act requiring bank regulators to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies that are at least of the same nature as those applicable to financial institutions 
pursuant to the collins amendment  trust preferred securities trups issued by bank or thrift holding companies after may  will be counted as tier capital with an exception for certain small bank holding companies  where trups previously qualified as tier capital 
bank holding companies with billion in assets as of december  have five years to comply  and starting on january   these holding companies will share in the requirement by deducting one third of trups a year for the following three years from tier capital 
trups issued prior to may  by bank holding companies with less than billion in assets as of december  are exempt from these capital deductions entirely 
we anticipate that the requirements of the dodd frank act will be implemented over time and will be subject to regulatory rule making and implementation over the course of several years 
although we cannot predict the specific impact and long term effects that the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will have on us and our prospects  our target markets and the financial industry in general  we believe that the dodd frank act and the regulation promulgation thereunder may impose additional administrative obligations that will obligate us to incur additional expenses 
consumer financial protection bureau the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb was created under the dodd frank act to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection with broad rulemaking  supervision and enforcement authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that would apply to all banks and thrifts  including the equal credit opportunity act  truth in lending act  real estate settlement procedures act  fair credit reporting act  fair debt collection act  the consumer financial privacy provisions of the gramm leach bliley act and certain other statutes 
banking institutions with total assets of billion or less  such as the bank  remain subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws and such additional regulations as may be adopted by the cfpb 

table of contents the cfpb has already finalized rules relating to remittance transfers under the electronic fund transfer act  which requires companies to provide consumers with certain disclosures before the consumer pays for a remittance transfer 
these new rules took effect in february the cfpb has also amended certain rules under regulation c relating to home mortgage disclosure to reflect a change in the asset size exemption threshold for depository institutions based on the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers 
in addition  on january   the cfpb released its final ability to repay qualified mortgage rules  which amend the trust in lending act regulation z 
regulation z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer s ability to repay the loan 
the final rule implements sections and of the dodd frank act  which generally require creditors to make a reasonable  good faith determination of a consumer s ability to repay any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling excluding an open end credit plan  timeshare plan  reverse mortgage  or temporary loan and establishes certain protections from liability under this requirement for qualified mortgages 
the final rule also implements section of the dodd frank act  which limits prepayment penalties 
finally  the final rule requires creditors to retain evidence of compliance with the rule for three years after a covered loan is consummated 
the rule will become effective january  small business lending fund the small business jobs and credit act of created the small business lending fund to invest capital into community banking organizations 
through the fund  the us treasury invested in financial institutions through the purchase of senior preferred stock or indebtedness 
the us treasury could invest up to of risk weighted assets for financial institutions with billion of total assets or less as of december   or up to of risk weighted assets for financial institutions with more than billion  but less than billion  in total assets on that date 
the starting point for dividend rates on the senior preferred stock issued by participants to the us treasury is for c corporations 
financial institutions could buy down the rate to as low as by increasing the level of small business loans 
the increase will be measured based on the increase over a baseline level  which is generally the average amount of small business lending reported by that institution in its call report for the four full quarters immediately preceding the date of enactment of the small business jobs and credit act  less a net loan charge offs with respect to small business lending  and b gains realized from mergers  acquisitions or purchases of loans after origination 
for every by which the amount of small business lending has increased  the dividend or interest rate on senior preferred stock will be reduced by 
if  however  small business lending has remained the same or decreased relative to the baseline level in the eighth quarter  the rate the participant would pay would increase to beginning in the tenth quarter and continuing until the end of the four and a half year period from initial funding 
after the four and a half year period from initial funding  the rate will increase to until the senior preferred stock issued to the us treasury is redeemed 
on september   we sold  shares of sblf preferred stock to the secretary of the us treasury for a purchase price of million 
the sblf preferred stock is senior to our common stock 
in connection with our participation in the fund  we were required to develop a small business lending plan describing our business strategy and operating goals to address the needs of small businesses in the areas we serve  as well as a plan to provide linguistically and culturally appropriate outreach  where appropriate to certain groups 
on an on going basis  we must comply with certain reporting requirements of the fund in order for the us treasury to assess whether we are complying with the requirements of the fund and to determine the dividend rate on the sblf preferred stock 
as of december   we believe we were in compliance with all the requirements of the sblf 
our effective dividend rate has been since the issuance and sale of the sblf preferred stock 
gramm leach bliley act of the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act implemented major changes to the statutory framework for providing banking and other financial services in the united states 
the glb act  among other things  eliminated many of the restrictions on affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance firms and other financial service providers 
a bank holding company that qualifies as a financial holding company will be permitted to engage in activities that are financial in nature or incident or complimentary to financial activities 
the activities that the glb act expressly lists as financial in nature include insurance activities  providing financial and investment advisory services  underwriting services and limited merchant banking activities 
to be eligible for these expanded activities  a bank holding company must qualify as a financial holding company 
to qualify as a financial holding company  each insured depository institution controlled by the bank holding company must be well capitalized and well managed and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act of see community reinvestment act below 
in addition  the bank holding company must file with the federal reserve a declaration of its intention to become a financial holding company 
the dodd frank act amended this provision to require that financial holding companies also be well capitalized and well managed 

table of contents although the glb act is considered one of the most significant banking laws since depression era statutes were enacted  the glb act has not  and we do not expect that the glb act will in the future  materially affect our products  services or other business activities  nor do we believe that the glb act will have a material adverse impact on our operations 
to the extent that it allows banks  securities firms and insurance firms to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation and greater competition 
payment of cash dividends xenith bankshares is a legal entity  separate and distinct from xenith bank 
both xenith bankshares and xenith bank are subject to laws and regulations that limit the payment of dividends  including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums 
xenith bankshares is incorporated under the virginia stock corporation act  which has restrictions prohibiting the payment of dividends if  after giving effect to the dividend payment  xenith bankshares would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or if xenith bankshares total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be required  if xenith bankshares were to be dissolved  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of any preferred shareholders 
consistent with its policy that bank holding companies should serve as a source of financial strength for their subsidiary banks  the federal reserve has stated that  as a matter of prudence  banks generally should not maintain a rate of distributions to shareholders unless our net income has been sufficient to fully fund the distributions  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
further  the federal reserve issued supervisory letter sr on february  and revised march   which provides guidance on the declaration and payment of dividends  capital redemptions and capital repurchases by bank holding companies 
supervisory letter sr provides that  as a general matter  a bank holding company should eliminate  defer or significantly reduce its dividends  if the bank holding company s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters  net of dividends previously paid during that period  is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends  the bank holding company s prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition  or the bank holding company will not meet  or is in danger of not meeting  its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios 
failure to do so could result in a supervisory finding that the bank holding company is operating in an unsafe and unsound manner 
banking regulators have indicated that virginia banking organizations should generally pay dividends only from net undivided profits of the bank  after providing for all expenses  losses  interest and taxes accrued or due by the bank  and if the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
in particular  under the current supervisory practices of the federal reserve  prior approval from the federal reserve and a supermajority of the bank s shareholders is required  if cash dividends declared in any given year exceed net income for that year plus retained earnings of the two preceding years 
in addition  under the fdia  insured depository institutions such as the bank are prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the statute 
under virginia law  no dividend may be declared or paid out of a bank s paid in capital 
xenith bankshares may be prohibited under virginia law from the payment of dividends  if the bureau of financial institutions determines that a limitation of dividends is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure our financial soundness  and may also permit the payment of dividends not otherwise allowed by virginia law 
the terms of the sblf preferred stock also impose limits on our ability to pay dividends on shares of our common stock 
loans to insiders the federal reserve act and related regulations impose specific restrictions on loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of banks 
under section h of the federal reserve act  any loan to a director  executive officer or principal shareholder of a bank  or to entities controlled by any of the foregoing  may not exceed  together with all outstanding loans to such persons or entities controlled by such person  the bank s loan to one borrower limit 
loans in the aggregate to insiders and their related interests as a class may not exceed two times the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus until the bank s total assets equal or exceed million  at which time the aggregate is limited to the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
section h also prohibits loans above amounts prescribed by the appropriate federal banking agency to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of a bank or bank holding company  and to entities controlled by such persons  unless such loans are approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank with any interested director not participating in the voting 
our policy on loans to insiders establishes a maximum amount  which includes all other outstanding loans to such persons  as to which prior board of director s approval is required  of the greater of  or of capital and surplus up to 
section h requires that loans 
table of contents to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders be made in terms and underwriting standards substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons 
the dodd frank act expanded coverage of transactions with insiders by including credit exposure arising from derivative transactions 
in addition  the dodd frank act prohibits an insured depository institution from purchasing or selling an asset to an executive officer  director or principal shareholder or any related interest of such a person unless the transaction is on market terms  and if the transaction exceeds of the institution s capital  it is approved in advance by a majority of the disinterested directors 
restrictions on transactions with affiliates the bank is subject to the provisions of section a of the federal reserve act with respect to affiliates  including xenith bankshares 
these provisions place limits on the amount of loans or extensions of credit to affiliates  investment in affiliates  assets that the bank may purchase from affiliates  except for real and personal property exempted by the federal reserve  the amount of loans or extensions of credit to third parties collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates  and the bank s guarantee  acceptance or letter of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
the total amount of the above transactions are limited in amount  as to any one affiliate  to of capital and surplus and  as to all affiliates combined  to of capital and surplus 
in addition to the limitation on the amount of these transactions  each of the above transactions must also meet specified collateral requirements 
the bank must also comply with other provisions designed to avoid the taking of low quality assets from an affiliate 
the bank also is subject to the provisions of section b of the federal reserve act  which  among other things  prohibits the bank from engaging in any transaction with an affiliate unless the transaction is on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non affiliated companies 
the dodd frank act expanded the scope of section a to include investment funds managed by an institution as an affiliate  as well as other procedural and substantive hurdles 
certain acquisitions the bank holding company act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before acquiring more than of the voting stock of any bank or other bank holding company  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company  or merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company 
additionally  the bank holding company act provides that the federal reserve may not approve any of these transactions  if it would result in or tend to create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition or otherwise function as a restraint of trade  unless the anti competitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bank holding companies and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the federal reserve s consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy  which is discussed below 
as a result of the usa patriot act of  which is discussed below  the federal reserve is required to consider the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary bank s in combating money laundering activities in its evaluation of bank holding company merger or acquisition transactions 
the dodd frank act also amended the bank holding company act to require consideration of the extent to which a proposed acquisition  merger or consolidation would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system 
under the bank holding company act  if well capitalized and well managed  any bank holding company located in virginia may purchase a bank located outside of virginia 
conversely  a well capitalized and well managed bank holding company located outside of virginia may purchase a bank located inside virginia 
in each case  however  restrictions currently exist on the acquisition of a bank that has only been in existence for a limited amount of time or will result in specified concentrations of deposits 
change in bank control subject to various exceptions  the bank holding company act and the change in bank control act of  together with related regulations  require federal reserve approval prior to any person or company acquiring control of a bank 
table of contents holding company 
control is conclusively presumed to exist if a person or company acquires or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company 
control is rebuttably presumed to exist if a person or company acquires or more  but less than  of any class of voting securities 
sound banking practices bank holding companies are not permitted to engage in unsound banking practices 
for example  the federal reserve s regulation y requires a bank holding company to give the federal reserve prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year is equal to or more of xenith bankshares consolidated net worth 
the federal reserve may oppose the transaction  if it believes that the transaction would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law or regulation 
as another example  a holding company could not impair its subsidiary bank s soundness by causing it to make funds available to non banking subsidiaries or their customers if the federal reserve believed it not prudent to do so 
the financial institutions reform  recovery and enforcement act of firrea expanded the federal reserve s authority to prohibit activities of bank holding companies and their non banking subsidiaries which represent unsafe and unsound banking practices or which constitute violations of laws or regulations 
firrea increased the amount of civil money penalties which the federal reserve can assess for activities conducted on a knowing and reckless basis  if those activities caused a substantial loss to a depository institution 
the penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues 
firrea also expanded the scope of individuals and entities against which such penalties may be assessed 
under firrea  a depository institution  the deposits of which are insured by the fdic  can be held liable for any loss incurred by  or reasonably expected to be incurred by  the fdic in connection with the default of a commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution  or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled fdic insured depository institution in danger of default 
default is defined generally as the appointment of a conservator or a receiver  and in danger of default is defined generally as the existence of certain conditions indicating that default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance 
the bank is an fdic insured depository institution  and with respect to which bankcap partners is a bank holding company 
bankcap partners is also a bank holding company for atlantic capital bank 
in some circumstances depending upon the amount of the loss or anticipated loss suffered by the fdic  cross guarantee liability may result in the ultimate failure or insolvency of one or more insured depository institutions in a holding company structure 
any obligation or liability owed by a subsidiary bank to its parent company is subordinated to the subsidiary bank s cross guarantee liability with respect to commonly controlled insured depository institutions 
anti tying restrictions the bank is prohibited from tying the provision of services  such as extensions of credit  to certain other services offered by the bank  its holding company or its affiliates 
standards for safety and soundness the federal reserve has established safety and soundness standards applicable to the bank regarding such matters as internal controls  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate risk exposure  asset growth  compensation and other benefits  and asset quality and earnings 
if the bank were to fail to meet these standards  the federal reserve could require it to submit a written compliance plan describing the steps the bank will take to correct the situation and the time within which such steps will be taken 
the federal reserve has authority to issue orders to secure adherence to the safety and soundness standards 
reserve requirement under a regulation promulgated by the federal reserve  depository institutions  including the bank  are required to maintain cash reserves against a stated percentage of their transaction accounts 
current reserve requirements for calendar year are as follows for transaction accounts totaling million or less  a reserve of for transaction accounts in excess of million up to and including million  a reserve of  and for transaction accounts totaling in excess of million  a reserve requirement of million plus of that portion of the total transaction accounts greater than million 
the dollar amounts and percentages reported here are all subject to adjustment by the federal reserve 
as of december   the bank had a reserve requirement of million 

table of contents privacy financial institutions are required to disclose their policies for collecting and protecting confidential information 
under the glb act  financial institutions may not disclose non public personal information about a customer to unaffiliated third parties  unless the institution satisfies various disclosure requirements and the consumer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure with some exceptions 
additionally  financial institutions generally may not disclose consumer account numbers to any non affiliated third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail to consumers 
monetary policy banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials 
in general  the differences between the interest paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest received by a bank on loans extended to its customers and securities held in its investment portfolio constitute a major portion of earnings 
thus  our earnings and growth will be subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  and also to the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve  which regulates the supply of money through various means including open market transactions in united states government securities 
these transactions include the purchase and sale of securities to expand or contract the general liquidity in the financial system 
additionally  the federal reserve establishes a target federal fund rate and the discount rate 
actions taken by the federal reserve influence the general condition of interest rates in the marketplace 
the bank s earnings are primarily a function of differentials between interest rates 
depending on the bank s asset liability strategy  actions taken by the federal reserve may have a positive or negative effect on profitability 
we cannot predict the actions of the federal reserve  nor can we guarantee that our asset liability strategy is consistent with action taken by the federal reserve 
community reinvestment act the community reinvestment act cra requires federal banking regulators to evaluate the record of financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those institutions 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
federal regulators are required to provide and make public a written examination report of an institution s cra performance 
the bank continues to maintain a satisfactory cra rating 
branch and interstate banking the federal banking agencies are authorized to approve interstate bank merger transactions without regard to whether such transaction is prohibited by the law of any state  unless the home state of one of the banks has opted out of the interstate bank merger provisions of the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the riegle neal act by adopting a law after the date of enactment of the riegle neal act and prior to june  that applies equally to all out of state banks and expressly prohibits merger transactions involving out of state banks 
such interstate bank mergers and branch acquisitions  described below  are also subject to the nationwide and statewide insured deposit concentration limitations described in the riegle neal act 
under the dodd frank act  national banks and state banks are able to establish branches in any state  if that state would permit the establishment of the branch by a state bank chartered in that state 
virginia law permits a state bank to establish a branch of the bank anywhere in the state  therefore  a bank with its headquarters outside the commonwealth of virginia may establish branches anywhere within virginia 
regulatory enforcement authority federal and state banking law grants substantial enforcement powers to federal and state banking regulators 
this enforcement authority includes  among other things  the ability to assess civil money penalties  to issue cease and desist or removal orders  and to initiate injunctive actions against banking organizations and institution affiliated parties 
in general  these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices 
other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action  including misleading or untimely reports filed with regulatory authorities 
concentrated commercial real estate lending regulations the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the fdic has promulgated guidance governing financial institutions with concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance provides that a bank has a concentration in commercial real estate lending  if total reported loans for construction  land development  and other land represent or more of total capital  or total reported loans secured by multi family and non farm residential properties and loans for construction  land development  and other land represent or more of total capital  and the bank s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased or more during the prior months 
if a concentration is 
table of contents present  management must employ heightened risk management practices  including board and management oversight and strategic planning  development of underwriting standards  risk assessment and monitoring through market analysis and stress testing  and increasing capital requirements 
allowance for loan and lease losses federal bank regulatory agencies have released the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses to ensure consistency with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and more recent supervisory guidance 
additionally  the agencies issued frequently asked questions to assist institutions in complying with both gaap and allowance for loan and lease losses supervisory guidance 
highlights of the statement include the following the statement emphasizes that the allowance for loan and lease losses represents one of the most significant estimates in an institution s financial statements and regulatory reports and that an assessment of the appropriateness of the allowance for loan and lease losses is critical to an institution s safety and soundness  each institution has a responsibility to develop  maintain and document a comprehensive  systematic and consistently applied process for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
an institution must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses that is sufficient to cover estimated credit losses on individual impaired loans as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the portfolio  and the statement updated the previous guidance on the following issues regarding allowance for loan and lease losses responsibilities of the board of directors  management and bank examiners  factors to be considered in the estimation of allowance for loan and lease losses  and objectives and elements of an effective loan review system 
usa patriot act of the usa patriot act of the patriot act was enacted in response to the september  terrorist attacks and is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and the intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the potential impact of the patriot act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the patriot act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and imposes various regulations  including standards for verifying client identification at account opening and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 
technology risk management and consumer privacy state and federal banking regulators have issued various policy statements emphasizing the importance of technology risk management and supervision in evaluating the safety and soundness of depository institutions with respect to banks that contract with outside vendors to provide data processing and core banking functions 
the use of technology related products  services  delivery channels and processes exposes a bank to various risks  particularly operational  privacy  security  strategic  reputation and compliance risk 
banks are generally expected to prudently manage technology related risks as part of their comprehensive risk management policies by identifying  measuring  monitoring and controlling risks associated with the use of technology 
under section of the glb act  the federal banking agencies have established appropriate standards for financial institutions regarding the implementation of safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information  protection against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such records  and protection against unauthorized access to or use of such records or information in a way that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to a customer 
among other matters  the rules require each bank to implement a comprehensive written information security program that includes administrative  technical and physical safeguards relating to customer information 
under the glb act  a financial institution must also provide its customers with a notice of privacy policies and practices 
section prohibits a financial institution from disclosing non public personal information about a customer to nonaffiliated third parties unless the institution satisfies various notice and opt out requirements and the customer has not elected to opt out of the disclosure 
under section  the agencies are authorized to issue regulations as necessary to implement notice requirements and restrictions on a financial institution s ability to disclose non public personal information about customers to nonaffiliated third parties 
under the final rule the regulators adopted  all banks must develop initial and annual privacy notices that describe in general terms the bank s information sharing practices 
banks that share non public personal information about customers with nonaffiliated third parties must also provide customers with an opt out notice and a reasonable period of time for the customer to opt out of any such disclosure with certain exceptions 
limitations are placed on the extent to which a bank can disclose an account number or access code for credit card  deposit or transaction accounts to any nonaffiliated third party for use in marketing 

table of contents other regulation the bank is subject to a variety of other regulations 
state and federal laws restrict interest rates on loans 
the truth in lending act and the home mortgage disclosure act impose information requirements on us in making loans 
the equal credit opportunity act prohibits discrimination in lending on the basis of race  creed or other prohibited factors 
the fair credit reporting act governs the use and release of information to credit reporting agencies 
the truth in savings act requires disclosure of yields and costs of deposits and deposit accounts 
other acts govern confidentiality of consumer financial records  automatic deposits and withdrawals  check settlement  endorsement and presentment  and reporting of cash transactions as required by the internal revenue service 
future regulatory uncertainty because federal regulation of financial institutions changes regularly and is the subject of constant legislative debate  we cannot forecast how federal regulation of financial institutions may change in the future and impact our operations 
although congress in recent years has sought to reduce the regulatory burden on financial institutions with respect to the approval of specific transactions  we fully expect that the our industry will remain heavily regulated in the near future and that additional laws or regulations may be adopted  further regulating specific banking practices 
employees at december   we had employees  including full time employees 
all of our employees were employed by the bank 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit  and we believe that relations with our employees are good

executive officers of the registrant the information set forth in part iii  item under the caption executive officers of the registrant included herein pursuant to item b of regulation s k is incorporated by reference into this part i 
item a risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following factors should be carefully considered in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements contained herein 
any of the following risks  either alone or taken together  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  regulatory capital levels and prospects 
if one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize  or if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect  we could be materially and adversely affected 
there may be additional risks that we do not presently know or that we currently believe are immaterial that could also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations  regulatory capital levels and prospects 
the slow economic recovery  especially in our target markets  could materially and adversely affect us 
the recent recession contributed to a rise in unemployment and underemployment  a decline in the value of real estate and other assets  and a lack of confidence in the financial markets and the economy both among financial institutions and their customers 
economic growth has been slow and the economic pressure on consumers and commercial borrowers and 
table of contents lack of confidence in the economy and financial markets resulting from the slow recovery have adversely affected  and continue to affect  the willingness of companies to borrow to fund their future growth  which negatively impacts our business 
market developments may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause adverse changes in payment patterns  causing increases in delinquencies and default rates for financial institutions  which may impact charge offs and provisions for credit losses 
a protracted continuation or worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the banking industry and our business 
unlike many of our larger competitors  the majority of our middle market business and individual customers are located or doing business in our target markets 
as a result  we may be more impacted by a local slow economic recovery or downturn than those of larger  more geographically diverse competitors 
furthermore  based on the size and resources of our middle market and small business customers  they may be less able to withstand sustained difficult economic conditions than larger companies with which they compete 
factors that adversely affect the economy in our target markets could reduce our deposit base and demand for our services and products and increase our credit losses 
consequently  we may be adversely affected  potentially materially  by adverse changes in economic conditions in and around virginia 
although we have monitored the impact of the recent recession on the values of real estate in our target markets and have set discounts and reserves against our loan portfolio  our discounts and reserves may be insufficient 
furthermore  the economy could slip back into recession and real estate values could worsen  either of which could lead to increased portfolio losses in the future that would materially and adversely affect us 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our operating results as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on our loans and investments and interest paid on our deposits and borrowings 
our operating results are significantly dependent on our net interest income  as we expect to realize income primarily from the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
we will experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities  as measured by the relative duration of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the net position of those assets and liabilities  subject to re pricing in specified time periods  will positively or negatively affect our operating results 
if market interest rates should move contrary to our position  this gap may work against us and negatively affect our operating results  potentially materially 
we cannot predict fluctuations of market interest rates  which are affected by many factors  including inflation  recession  unemployment  monetary policy  and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets 
although our asset liability management strategy is intended to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates  changes in interest rates could materially and adversely affect us 
as reflected in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations interest rate sensitivity gap analysis  on a cumulative basis for maturities and re pricings within the next months  we reflect interest rate sensitive assets exceeding interest rate sensitive liabilities resulting in an asset sensitive position as of december  of million  which would reduce our operating results if market interest rates were to decline during that period 
changes in market interest rates could reduce the value of our financial assets 
fixed rate investments  mortgage backed and related securities  and loans generally decrease in value as interest rates rise 
in addition  volatile interest rates affect the volume of our lending activities 
for example  when interest rates rise  the cost of borrowing increases and loan originations tend to decrease 
this could result in lower net interest income  lower loan origination fee income  and a decline in sales of treasury services 
if we are unsuccessful in managing the effects of changes in interest rates  we could be materially and adversely affected 
we face significant competition in our target markets 
the financial services industry  including commercial banking  mortgage banking  consumer lending and home equity lending  is highly competitive  and we have encountered and will continue to encounter strong competition for deposits  loans and other financial services and products in our target markets 
our principal competitors for loans and some or all of our other services and products are other commercial banks and community banks in our target markets 
our principal competitors for deposits include commercial banks  community banks  money market funds  credit unions and trust companies 
our non bank competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as we are and  accordingly  have advantages over us in providing certain products and services 
many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are and have greater access to capital and other resources that permit them to offer attractive terms and broader selections to gain market share for their products and services and also have higher lending capacity and larger branch networks 
weak loan demand has increased competition resulting in aggressive pricing terms for borrowers 
as a result  we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract customers  either of which would adversely affect us 

table of contents we have branches in richmond  virginia  tysons corner in northern virginia  and suffolk  virginia 
suffolkfirst bank did not have branches in richmond or tysons corner prior to the merger  so we are not able to build from a pre existing customer base in either of these markets 
to expand our customer base at all of our branches and in our target markets  generally  we must successfully compete against competitors with established businesses  relationships and reputations in those markets 
this competition could result in decreased demand for our services and products and our loss of  or inability to gain  market share  which could materially and adversely affect us 
failure to implement our business strategies could materially and adversely affect us 
our directors and executive officers have developed a business plan that details the business strategies we intend to implement 
our business plan includes organic growth and  if appropriate  growth through acquisitions 
our organic growth may involve an expansion into related banking lines of business and related services and products  which would involve additional risks 
if we cannot implement our business strategies  we will be hampered in our ability to maintain and grow our business and serve our customers  which would in turn materially and adversely affect us 
even if our business strategies are successfully implemented  they may not have the favorable impact on our operations that we anticipate 
failure to manage expansion could materially and adversely affect our business 
our ability to offer services and products and implement our business strategies successfully in a highly competitive market requires an effective planning and management process 
future expansion efforts  internally or through acquisitions  could be expensive and put a strain on our management  financial  operational and technical resources 
to manage growth effectively  we will likely have to continue to enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls  as well as integrate new personnel  including relationship managers  and manage expanded operations 
if we are unable to grow our business or manage our growth effectively  we could be materially and adversely affected 
we will face risks with respect to future expansion and acquisitions or mergers 
we may seek to acquire other financial institutions or branches or assets of those institutions 
we may also expand into new markets or lines of business or offer new products or services 
these activities would involve a number of risks  including the time and expense associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions and merger partners  using inaccurate estimates and judgments to evaluate credit  operations  management and market risks with respect to the target institution or its branches or assets  diluting our existing shareholders in an acquisition  the time and expense associated with evaluating new markets for expansion  hiring experienced local management and opening new offices or branches as there may be a substantial time lag between these activities and when we generate sufficient assets and deposits to support the costs of the expansion  taking a significant amount of time negotiating a transaction or working on expansion plans  resulting in management s time and attention being diverted from the operation of our existing business  the time and expense associated with integrating the operations and personnel of the combined businesses  the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  including tax benefits  creating an adverse short term effect on our results of operations  losing key employees and customers as a result of an acquisition that is poorly received  time and costs associated with regulatory approvals  competition from other purchasers  lack of information on a target institution or its branches or assets  inability to obtain additional financing  if necessary  on favorable terms or at all  and unforeseen adjustments  write downs  write offs  or restructuring or other impairment charges 
the soundness of other financial institutions with which we do business could adversely affect us 
our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  including counterparties in the financial industry  such as commercial banks 
as a result  defaults by  or even rumors or questions 
table of contents about  one or more financial services institutions  or the financial services industry generally  have led to market wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions 
many of these transactions will expose us to risk of loss in the event of default of a counterparty or client 
in addition  this risk may be exacerbated when any collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us 
our losses from these events could be material 
our earnings are sensitive to the credit risks associated with lending 
the credit risk associated with commercial and industrial loans is a result of several factors  including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers  the size of loan balances  which is generally larger than consumer type loans  and the effects of general economic conditions on a borrower s business 
our commercial and industrial loan portfolio represented approximately of our total loan portfolio as of december  any significant failure to pay on time by our customers or a significant default by our customers would materially and adversely affect us 
in addition to commercial real estate loans that are or will be secured by commercial real estate  our commercial and industrial loans include owner occupied real estate loans that are secured in part by the value of the real estate 
owner occupied real estate loans represented approximately of our total commercial and industrial loan portfolio as of december  the primary source of repayment for owner occupied real estate loans is the cash flow produced by the related commercial enterprise  and the value of the real estate is a secondary source of repayment of the loan 
our commercial real estate loan portfolio represented approximately of our total loan portfolio as of december  underwriting and portfolio management activities cannot eliminate all risks related to these loans 
commercial real estate loans will typically be larger than consumer type loans and may pose greater risks than other types of loans 
it may be more difficult for commercial real estate borrowers to repay their loans in a timely manner in the current economic climate  as commercial real estate borrowers abilities to repay their loans frequently depends on the successful development of their properties 
in addition  we may incur losses on commercial real estate loans due to declines in occupancy rates and rental rates  which may decrease property values and may decrease the likelihood that a borrower may find permanent financing alternatives 
currently  the availability of permanent financing alternatives in the market has been reduced and the terms have become more onerous  thereby increasing the re financing risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
given the continued weaknesses in the commercial real estate market in general  there may be loans where the value of our collateral has been negatively impacted 
the weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans  which could negatively impact our loan portfolio s performance and asset quality 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values  we could incur material losses 
in addition  banking regulators are giving greater scrutiny to commercial real estate lending and may require banks with higher levels of commercial real estate loans to implement improved or additional underwriting  internal controls  risk management policies and portfolio stress testing 
in banks with certain levels of commercial real estate loan concentrations  regulators are also considering requiring increased levels of reserves for loan losses  as well as the need for additional capital 
any of these events could increase our costs  require management time and attention  and materially and adversely affect us 
as of december   we had a total of million in outstanding residential real estate loans  comprising of our total loan portfolio  and a total of million in outstanding consumer loans  or of our total loan portfolio 
while residential real estate loans and consumer loans are more diversified than loans to commercial borrowers  a systematic decline in the economic health of a community  such as major job loss  could materially and adversely affect us 
also  a broad based decline in the value of residential real estate that serves as our secondary source of repayment could materially and adversely affect us 
decisions regarding credit risk could be inaccurate and our allowance for loan and lease losses may be inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in the portfolio  which could materially and adversely affect us 
our loan portfolio and a small portion of our investment portfolio expose us to credit risk 
only million  or  of our million investment portfolio was represented by securities other than us agency securities as of december  inherent risks in lending include the deterioration of the credit of borrowers and adverse changes in the industries and competitive environments in which they operate  changes in borrowers management and business prospects  fluctuations in interest rates and collateral values  principally real estate  and economic downturns 
making loans is an essential element of our business  and there is a high risk that some portion of the loans we make will not be repaid and  accordingly  will result in losses 
given our size  these losses could be concentrated in one or more borrowers and could be significant 
the risk of loss is affected by a number of factors  including credit risks of a particular borrower  
table of contents the duration of the loan  changes in economic or industry conditions  and in the case of a collateralized loan  risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral 
in addition  we may suffer higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or other regulatory action that reduces the amount that our borrowers are required to pay to us  prohibits or otherwise limits our ability to foreclose on properties or other collateral  or makes foreclosures less economically viable 
as with all financial institutions  our management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of our loan portfolio  and we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses and other reserves to absorb anticipated future losses inherent in our portfolio 
as of the respective effective date of the merger  the paragon transaction and vbb acquisition  and as required by acquisition accounting rules  we recorded acquired loans at estimated fair values by creating a discount and eliminating the allowance for loan and lease losses 
however  to the extent that the credit losses of the purchased loan portfolios are greater than our fair value adjustments at the effective date of these transactions  we could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to increase reserves or recognize loan charge offs 
because our allowance methodologies take into account qualitative factors within our institution  as well as the external economic environment  there is potential for inconsistencies in our methodology and the methodologies deemed appropriate for us by the bank regulatory agencies 
if management s assumptions and judgments prove to be inaccurate and our allowance for loan and lease losses is inadequate to absorb future losses inherent in our loan portfolio  or if bank regulatory agencies require us to increase our allowance for loan and lease losses or to recognize loan charge offs  our capital could be significantly reduced  and we could be materially and adversely affected 
our decisions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be different than initially estimated which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
we acquired a significant portion of our loans held for investment  in connection with the merger  the paragon transaction and the vbb acquisition 
although these loans were marked down to their estimated fair values  as of the effective dates of the transactions  there is no assurance that the acquired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value resulting in additional charge offs 
the fluctuations in national  regional and local economic conditions  including those related to local residential  commercial real estate and construction markets  may increase the level of charge offs in the loan portfolios that we acquired and  correspondingly reduce our net income 
these fluctuations are not predictable  cannot be controlled and may have a material adverse impact on our operations  financial condition  and our ability to grow our business  even if other favorable events occur 
we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about our customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we rely on information furnished by or on behalf of our customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we also rely on representations of those customers or counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could result in losses that materially and adversely affect us 
even if we receive accurate information  we may misjudge that information and fail to assess the credit risks in a manner that materially and adversely affects us 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of the property 
however  an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made  and an error in fact or judgment could adversely affect the reliability of an appraisal 
in addition  events occurring after the initial appraisal may cause the value of the real estate to decrease 
as a result of any of these factors  the value of collateral backing a loan may be less than supposed  and if a default occurs  we may not recover the outstanding balance of the loan 

table of contents commercial real estate lending guidance issued by the federal banking regulators could impact our operations and capital requirements 
the federal reserve  the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ and the fdic  along with the other federal banking regulators  issued final guidance on december   entitled concentrations in commercial real estate lending  sound risk management practices directed at financial institutions that have particularly high concentrations of commercial real estate loans within their lending portfolios 
this guidance suggests that institutions whose commercial real estate loans exceed certain percentages of capital should implement heightened risk management practices appropriate to their concentration risk and may be required to maintain higher capital ratios than institutions with lower concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
based on our commercial real estate concentration as of december   we are not subject to additional supervisory analysis but could be in the future 
our management has implemented controls to monitor our commercial real estate lending and will continue to enhance and monitor those controls  but we cannot predict the extent to which this guidance may impact our future operations or capital requirements 
moreover  any risk management practices that we implement may not be effective to prevent losses in our loan portfolio  including our commercial real estate portfolio 
our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels and adequate sources of funding and liquidity may be adversely affected by market conditions and changes in capital requirements made by our regulators 
we are required to maintain certain capital levels in accordance with banking regulations 
we must also seek to maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support our lending and investment operations and repay our outstanding liabilities as they become due 
our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels  available sources of funding  and sufficient liquidity could be impacted by deteriorating economic and market conditions 
our business plan was presented to the federal reserve in connection with the application of bankcap partners to acquire control of first bankshares now xenith bankshares  and indirectly suffolkfirst bank now xenith bank 
as a condition to approval  bankcap partners committed that the bank would operate within the parameters of the business plan for three years from the date of the acquisition  which was december  as of december   the conditions as set forth in the business plan have been met  and we are required to maintain capital ratios that classify the bank as well capitalized 
our failure to meet any applicable regulatory guideline related to our lending activities or any capital requirement otherwise imposed upon us or to satisfy any other regulatory requirement could subject us to certain activity restrictions or to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the regulatory authorities  including limitations on our ability to pay dividends or pursue acquisitions  the issuance by regulatory authorities of a capital directive to increase capital  and the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic 
in determining the adequacy of our capital levels we use risk based capital ratios established by regulators 
in calculating our risk based ratios  we must apply risk weightings to our various asset classes 
for example  cash is risk weighted at  while a commercial and industrial loan for periods of one year or greater is risk weighted at 
the risk weighting applied to our assets affects the denominator we use to calculate our risk based capital ratios 
our regulators may change capital requirements  including previous interpretations or practices related risk weightings 
these changes  if they were to occur  could have a significant effect on our risk based capital ratios and could require us to raise additional capital to maintain required capital ratios 
one such change could relate to the assets we hold as loans held for sale through our participation in the mortgage warehouse lending program 
all of our loans held for sale are comprised of participation interests in mortgage loans to which we currently assign a risk weighting of  the weighting applicable under current regulations to mortgage loans 
the occ has stated its view that assets that do not qualify as participating interests  pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification  transfers and servicing  should be assigned a risk weighting associated with loans to mortgage companies that are secured by a pledge of mortgage loans as collateral 
we are not regulated by the occ  however  our regulators  the federal reserve and the bureau of financial institutions  may also consider adopting this or a similar position 
we cannot predict the likelihood that the occ will adopt this position  nor can we predict the likelihood that our regulators would follow this position 
we believe we have applied the correct risk weightings to our participation interests in the mortgage loans 
however  if our regulators were to interpret the risk weightings differently than our current application  our risk based capital ratios would be negatively impacted 
as of december   a change in risk weightings from to for our loans held for sale would not have a significant impact on our risk based capital ratios 
if such a change were to be required by our regulators and applied in future periods  as required by our regulators  we may be required to reduce our participation in the mortgage warehouse program  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings  or to raise additional capital to maintain our status as well capitalized 
we may not be able to access funding sufficient to support our growth 
our business strategies are based on access to funding from local customer deposits  such as checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposits 
deposit levels may be affected by a number of factors  including interest rates paid by competitors  general interest rate levels  returns available to customers on alternative investments  and general economic 
table of contents conditions 
if our deposit levels fall  we could lose a relatively low cost source of funding and our costs would increase from alternative funding 
if local customer deposits are not sufficient to fund our growth  we will look to outside sources such as borrowings from the federal home loan bank of atlanta fhlb  which is a secured funding source 
our ability to access borrowings from the fhlb will be dependent upon whether and the extent to which we can provide collateral 
we may also look to federal funds purchased and brokered deposits as discussed below under our use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators  which could adversely impact our liquidity or seek to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity related securities or the incurrence of debt as additional sources of liquidity 
if we are unable to access funding sufficient to support our growth or are only able to access such funding on unattractive terms  we may not be able to implement our business strategies 
we rely substantially on deposits made by our customers in our target markets  which can be materially and adversely affected by local and general economic conditions 
as of december   million  or  of our total deposits  consisted of non interest bearing demand accounts and interest bearing savings  money market and checking accounts 
the million remaining balance of deposits includes time deposits  of which approximately million  or of our total deposits  are due to mature within one year 
our ability to attract and maintain deposits  as well as our cost of funds  has been and will continue to be significantly affected by money market and general economic conditions 
in addition  with on going concerns about bank failures  customers have become concerned about the extent to which their deposits are insured by the fdic  particularly customers that may maintain deposits in excess of insured limits 
customers may withdraw deposits in an effort to ensure that the amount they have on deposit with our bank is fully insured and may place them in other financial institutions or make investments that are perceived as being more secure 
if we fail to attract new deposits or maintain existing deposits or are forced to increase interest rates paid to customers to attract and maintain deposits  our net interest income would be negatively impacted  and we could be materially and adversely affected 
our use of brokered deposits may be limited or discouraged by bank regulators  which could adversely impact our liquidity 
depositors that invest in brokered deposits are generally interest rate sensitive and well informed about alternative markets and investments 
consequently  these types of deposits may not provide the same stability to a bank s deposit base as traditional local retail deposit relationships 
in addition  our liquidity may be negatively affected if that funding source experiences supply difficulties due to loss of investor confidence or a flight to other investments 
regulatory developments with respect to wholesale funding  including increased fdic insurance costs for  or limits on the use of  these deposits  may further limit the availability of that alternative 
in light of regulatory pressure  there may be a cost premium for locally generated certificates of deposit as compared to brokered deposits  which may increase our cost of funding 
we may not be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
we may need additional capital to support our business  expand our operations or maintain our minimum capital requirements  however  we may not be able to raise additional funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock or other equity or equity related securities 
furthermore  the significant amount of our common stock that bankcap partners owns may discourage other potential investors from acquiring newly issued shares of our common stock or other equity or equity related securities 
we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors and other creditors unless we maintain sufficient liquidity 
our liquidity is used to make loans and investments and to repay liabilities including deposits as they become due or are demanded by depositors and other creditors 
our main source of liquidity is customer deposits 
as a part of our liquidity management  we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments 
potential alternative sources of liquidity include federal funds purchased and investment securities sold under repurchase agreements  as well as the repayment or sale of loans  securities to the extent not pledged as collateral or other assets  the utilization of available government and regulatory assistance programs  brokered deposits  borrowings from the fhlb  borrowings through the federal reserve s discount window  and the issuance of our debt securities and equity securities 
without sufficient liquidity from these potential sources of liquidity  we generally may not be able to meet our cash flow requirements to operate and grow our business and repay our obligations 
as we continue to grow  we may become more dependent on wholesale funding sources  which may include fhlb borrowings and borrowings through the federal reserve s discount window 
as of december   we had million of fhlb borrowings and million of brokered deposits outstanding 
if we are required to rely more heavily on wholesale funding sources to support our operations or growth in the future and such funding is expensive at such time  our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs 
in that case  our operating margins would be reduced  and we could be materially and adversely affected 

table of contents we may become subject to significant liabilities in the event the bank forecloses upon  or takes title to  real property 
when underwriting a commercial or residential real estate loan  we will generally take a lien on the real property  and  in some instances upon a default by the borrower  we may foreclose upon and take title to the property  which may lead to potential financial risk for us under applicable environmental laws 
we may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans 
we may also own and lease premises where branches and other facilities are located 
while we have lending  foreclosure and facilities guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination  hazardous substances could exist on some of the properties that the bank may own  manage or occupy 
we face the risk that environmental laws could force us to clean up the properties at our expense 
it may cost much more to remediate a property than the property is worth 
we could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower s operations  if the bank takes a role in managing those operations after a default 
many environmental laws impose liability  regardless of whether we knew of  or were responsible for  any contamination that existed or exists for the property 
the bank may also find it difficult or impossible to sell contaminated properties 
the disposition processes related to our nonperforming assets could result in losses in the future that would materially and adversely affect us 
as of december   our nonperforming loans totaled million  or of our loan portfolio  and our nonperforming assets  which include other real estate owned oreo  were million  or of our total assets 
until economic and real estate market conditions further improve  particularly in our target markets in and around virginia  we may incur additional losses relating to an increase in nonperforming loans and oreo  and such losses could be material 
when we acquire title to collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  we are required by accounting rules to mark such collateral to the then fair market value  less costs of disposal  which often results in a loss 
nonperforming assets adversely affect net income in various ways 
while we pay interest expense to fund nonperforming assets  no interest income is recorded on nonaccrual loans or other real estate owned  thereby adversely affecting income and returns on assets and equity 
additionally  we incur loan administration costs and the costs of maintaining properties carried as oreo 
nonperforming loans and oreo also increase our risk profile  and increases in the level of nonperforming loans and oreo could impact our regulators view of appropriate capital levels in light of such risks 
while we seek to manage our problem assets through loan sales  workouts  restructurings  foreclosures and otherwise  decreases in the value of these assets  or in the underlying collateral  or in these borrowers results of operations  liquidity or financial condition  whether or not due to economic and market conditions beyond our or their control  could materially and adversely affect us 
in addition  the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant amount of management s time and attention  diverting their time from other business  which could be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities on our behalf 
given the geographic concentration of our operations  we could be significantly affected by any natural or man made disaster that affects virginia and surrounding areas 
our operations are concentrated in  and our loan portfolio consists almost entirely of  loans to persons and businesses located in and around virginia 
the collateral for many of our loans consists of real and personal property located in areas susceptible to hurricanes and other natural disasters as well as man made disasters that can cause extensive damage to the general region 
disaster conditions that hit in our target markets would adversely affect the local economies and real estate markets 
adverse economic conditions resulting from such a disaster could negatively affect the ability of our customers to repay their loans and could reduce the value of the collateral securing these loans 
furthermore  damage resulting from any natural or man made disaster could also result in continued economic uncertainty that could negatively impact businesses in those areas 
as a result  we could be materially and adversely affected by any natural or man made disaster that affects our target markets 
we are dependent on our key personnel  including our executive officers and directors  and the loss of such persons could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategies 
we will be for the foreseeable future dependent on the services of mr 
layfield  who is our president and chief executive officer  mr 
osgood  who is our chief financial officer and chief administrative officer  ms 
gavant  who is our controller and principal accounting officer  mr 
cottrell  who is an executive vice president and our chief credit officer  mr 
davis  who is an executive vice president and our chief operations and technology officer  mr 
phillips  who is an executive vice president and our chief lending officer  and mr 
o flaherty  who is an executive vice president responsible for our private banking business 
should the services of these individuals or other key executive officers become 
table of contents unavailable  we may be unable to find a suitable successor who would be willing to be employed upon the terms and conditions that we would offer 
we do not maintain key man insurance coverage on any of these individuals or other key executive officers 
a failure to replace any of these individuals in a timely and effective manner could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategies and otherwise disrupt our business 
our business is dependent on technology and an inability to invest in technological improvements or obtain reliable technological support may materially and adversely affect us 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven services and products 
in addition to better service to customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs 
our ability to grow and compete will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of customers by using technology to provide services and products that will satisfy their operational needs  while managing the costs of expanding our technology infrastructure 
many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements and third party support 
for the foreseeable future  we expect to rely on third party service providers for our core technology systems and on other third parties for technical support and related services 
if we are unable to implement and market new technology driven services and products successfully or if those services and products become unreliable or fail  our customer relationships and operations could be adversely affected  which could materially and adversely affect us 
system failure or breaches of our network security could lead to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
the computer systems and network infrastructure that we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent in part upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in operations could have an adverse effect on customers 
in addition  we must be able to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against physical damage  security breaches and service disruption caused by the internet or other users 
such computer break ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential customers 
we are subject to extensive regulation in the conduct of our business operations  which could materially and adversely affect us 
the banking industry is heavily regulated by several governmental agencies 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect the depositors  deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  and not shareholders and other creditors 
these regulations affect lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
for example  federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations limit the manner in which the bank may offer and extend credit 
in addition  the laws governing bankruptcy generally favor debtors  making it more expensive and more difficult to collect from customers who become subject to bankruptcy proceedings 
from time to time  the us congress and state legislatures consider changing these laws and may enact new laws or amend existing laws to further regulate the financial services industry 
on july   president obama signed the dodd frank act which will result in sweeping changes in the regulation of financial institutions 
the dodd frank act contains numerous provisions that affect all banks and bank holding companies  including provisions that  among other things change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to total consolidated assets less tangible capital  eliminate the ceiling on the size of the federal deposit insurance fund  and increase the floor of the size of the federal deposit insurance fund  which generally will require an increase in the level of assessments for institutions with assets in excess of billion  repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on demand deposits  thereby generally permitting the payment of interest on all deposit accounts  centralize responsibility for promulgating regulations under and enforcing federal consumer financial protection laws in a new bureau of consumer financial protection that will have direct supervision and examination authority over banks with more than billion in assets  require the fdic to seek to make its capital requirements for banks counter cyclical  impose comprehensive regulation of the over the counter derivatives market  which would include certain provisions that would effectively prohibit insured depository institutions from conducting certain derivatives businesses in the institution itself  
table of contents implement corporate governance revisions  including with regard to executive compensation and proxy access by shareholders  that apply to all public companies  not just financial institutions  establish new rules and restrictions regarding the origination of mortgages  and permit the federal reserve to prescribe regulations regarding interchange transaction fees  and limit them to an amount reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction in question 
many of these and other provisions in the dodd frank act remain subject to regulatory rule making and implementation  the effects of which are not yet known 
although we cannot predict the specific impact and long term effects that the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will have on us and our prospects  our target markets and the financial industry more generally  we believe that the dodd frank act and the regulations promulgated thereunder will impose additional administrative burdens that will obligate us to incur additional expenses 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could  among other things  subject us to additional costs and lower revenues  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  and require a significant amount of management s time and attention 
failure to comply with statutes  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties or reputational damage  which could materially and adversely affect us 
bankcap partners is a bank holding company that is deemed to be a multi bank holding company for two institutions 
under the federal reserve guidelines  every bank holding company must serve as a source of strength for each of their bank subsidiaries 
currently  bankcap partners is deemed a bank holding company for atlantic capital bank  an atlanta  georgia based bank  and the bank 
the position of bankcap partners as a source of strength to other depository institutions may limit its ability to serve as a source of strength for the bank and could adversely affect the bank s ability to access resources of bankcap partners 
federal bank regulatory agencies have additional discretion to require a bank holding company to divest itself of any bank or non bank subsidiary  if the agency determines that divestiture may aid the depository institution s financial condition 
the bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to any other financial institution as to which bankcap partners is deemed to be a bank holding company 
a bank for which bankcap partners is deemed to be a bank holding company may be required to indemnify  or cross guarantee  the fdic against losses the fdic incurs with respect to any other bank controlled by bankcap partners 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation act of requires that an insured depository institution shall be liable for the loss incurred or anticipated by the fdic arising from the default of a commonly controlled insured depository institution or any assistance provided by the fdic to any commonly controlled insured depository institution in danger of default 
accordingly  the bank may be obligated to provide financial assistance to atlantic capital bank  as well as any other financial institution for which bankcap partners is deemed to be a bank holding company as a result of its future acquisition activity  if any 
any financial assistance that the bank is required to provide would reduce our capital and could materially and adversely affect us 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures  current and potential shareholders may lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosures and could subject us to regulatory scrutiny 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  we are required to include in our annual reports on form k our management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
while our management s assessment included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  did not identify any material weaknesses  we cannot guarantee that we will not have any material weaknesses identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm in the future 
the dodd frank act includes a provision to permanently exempt non accelerated filers from complying with the requirements of section b  which requires an issuer to include in its annual report on form k an attestation report from the issuer s independent registered public accounting firm on the issuer s internal control over financial reporting 
since we were a non accelerated filer as of june  the last day of our most recently completed second quarter  we are not required to comply with the requirements of section b in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  however  if the market value of our common stock held by non affiliates equals million or more as of the end of the last day of our most recently completed second quarter  we will be required to provide an attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for the year in which we equal or exceed the million threshold 

table of contents compliance with the requirements of section is expensive and time consuming 
if  in the future  we fail to comply with these requirements in a timely manner or if our management or independent registered public accounting firm expresses a qualified or otherwise negative opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of confidence in our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  any failure to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and procedures could cause our current and potential shareholders and customers to lose confidence in our financial reporting and disclosure required under the exchange act  which could materially and adversely affect us 
the accuracy of our financial statements and related disclosures could be affected if future events differ significantly from the judgments  assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosure in conformity with gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our critical accounting policies  which we summarize in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies  describe those significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that we consider critical because they require judgments  assumptions and estimates about the future that materially impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
for example  material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change relate to the determination of our allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans  the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  and the application of acquisition accounting principles relating to acquisitions 
as a result  if future events differ significantly from the judgments  assumptions and estimates in our critical accounting policies  those events could have a material impact on the accuracy of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
the market value of our investments and loans held for sale may decline  which could cause a decline in our shareholders equity and negatively affect our results of operations 
we have designated our entire investment portfolio as securities available for sale pursuant to applicable accounting standards relating to accounting for investments 
these standards require that unrealized gains and losses in the estimated fair value of the available for sale investment securities portfolio be reflected as a separate item in shareholders equity  net of tax  as accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of december   we had million  or of our total assets  in securities available for sale at fair value 
shareholders equity reflects the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  of these investments 
management believes that several factors will affect the market values of our investment securities portfolio 
these include changes in interest rates or expectations of changes  the degree of volatility in the securities markets  inflation rates or expectations of inflation  the slope of the interest rate yield curve ie  the differences between shorter term and longer term interest rates and reduced investor demand 
lower market values for our available for sale securities may result in recognition of an other than temporary impairment charge to our net income 
if the market value of our investment securities portfolio declines  there will be a corresponding decline in shareholders equity  whether through accumulated other comprehensive income or lower results of operations 
our loans held for sale are also carried at the lower of cost or fair market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
as of december   we had million in loans held for sale 
these loans are held for short periods  usually less than days  and more typically days 
a rapid increase in interest rates may affect the market value of our loans held for sale 
if the market value of our loans held for sale declines  there would be a charge to our net income and corresponding reduction in our shareholders equity 
while we were profitable in and  we are uncertain as to future profitability 
for the years ended december  and  we reported pretax net income of million and million  respectively 
however  for the year ended december   our net income was due in part to the reversal of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax asset  and for the year ended december   our pretax net income was due to the bargain purchase gain resulting from the vbb acquisition 
prior to  we had not recorded a profit since the quarterly period ended march   which was prior to the merger 
for the year ended december  and for the period from january  through december   we incurred pretax net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 

table of contents the primary reasons for our losses in the periods prior to were noninterest expenses related to the development of our technology and other infrastructure and the hiring of experienced personnel to support our business strategy and projected growth 
we have made substantial progress in building our infrastructure and our team during the years ended december  and in particular  our investments to date have been critical to our business strategy  as they have allowed us to put into place the majority of the technology infrastructure and core operating platform to support our business strategy for the foreseeable future 
we believe  however  that we will need to make additional investments  especially related to hiring skilled bankers and  as needed  expanding our technology infrastructure to respond to new technologically driven services and products 
we expect these investments will be modest relative to the investments made in and our ability to continue to generate a profit in the future requires successful growth in revenues and management of expenses  among other factors 
we expect to recruit additional talented bankers who will help us attract target customers and grow our business 
while we expect the productivity of these additional bankers to exceed their incremental expenses over time  our operating results will be adversely impacted  if it does not happen promptly or at all 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  and we may never pay  or legally be able to pay  dividends 
we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception  and we presently do not intend to pay any dividends on common stock in the foreseeable future 
we are limited in the amount of dividends that we may pay to our shareholders pursuant to state and federal laws and regulations 
see item our business supervision and regulation payment of cash dividends 
the terms of the sblf preferred stock also impose limits on our ability to pay dividends 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity 
any future financing arrangements that we enter into may also limit our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
accordingly  we may never legally be able to pay dividends to our shareholders of common stock 
further  even if we have earnings and available cash in an amount sufficient to pay dividends to our shareholders of common stock  our board of directors  in its sole discretion  may decide to retain them and therefore not pay dividends in the future 
bankcap partners owns a significant number of shares of our common stock  which will enable it to influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders 
as of december   bankcap partners beneficially owned  shares of our common stock including warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  all of which warrants are currently exercisable  representing a beneficial ownership of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in addition  under the terms of the investor rights agreement  bankcap partners and all of the former directors and executive officers of xenith corporation who became directors and executive officers of xenith bankshares and who purchased shares of xenith corporation common stock in its june private offering have agreed to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of one designee of bankcap partners for election to our board of directors for so long as bankcap partners is a registered bank holding company under the bank holding company act  with respect to xenith bankshares  and one additional designee of bankcap partners for election to our board of directors for so long as bankcap partners and its affiliates own or more of our outstanding voting capital stock 
they have also agreed to vote their shares of our common stock in favor of removing the designee of bankcap partners on our board of directors at the request of bankcap partners and the election to our board of directors of a substitute designee of bankcap partners  and ensuring that any vacancy on our board of directors caused by resignation  removal or death of a bankcap partners designated director is filled in accordance with the agreement above 
brian d 
jones and scott a 
reed  each a principal of bankcap partners and a member of our board of directors  are the current designees of bankcap partners 
accordingly  bankcap partners  through its beneficial ownership of our common stock and board rights  will be able to participate in matters that come before our board of directors and influence the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  including the election of directors  amendments to the amended and restated articles of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws  mergers or other business combination transactions and certain sales of assets outside the usual and regular course of business 
the interests of bankcap partners may not coincide with the interests of our other shareholders  and they could take actions that advance their own interests to the detriment of our other shareholders 
the new cfpb may reshape the consumer financial laws through rulemaking and enforcement of unfair  deceptive or abusive acts or practices  which may directly impact the business operations of depository institutions offering consumer financial products or services including the bank 
the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority to administer and carry out the purposes and objectives of the federal consumer financial laws  and to prevent evasions thereof  with respect to all financial institutions that offer financial products and services to consumers 
the cfpb is also authorized to prescribe rules applicable to any covered person or service provider identifying and prohibiting acts or practices that are unfair  deceptive  or abusive in connection with any transaction with a consumer for a consumer financial product or service  or the offering of a consumer financial product or service udaap authority 
the potential reach of the cfpb s broad new rulemaking powers and udaap authority on the operations of financial institutions offering consumer financial products or services  including the bank  is currently unknown 

table of contents the bank is subject to federal and state and fair lending laws  and failure to comply with these laws could lead to material penalties 
federal and state fair lending laws and regulations  such as the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act  impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions 
the department of justice  cfpb and other federal and state agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations 
private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation 
a successful challenge to the bank s performance under the fair lending laws and regulations could adversely impact the bank s rating under the community reinvestment act and result in a wide variety of sanctions  including the required payment of damages and civil money penalties  injunctive relief  imposition of restrictions on merger and acquisition activity and restrictions on expansion activity  which could negatively impact the bank s reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel iii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for non basel iii us banks is uncertain 
on december   the basel committee proposed significant changes to bank capital and liquidity regulation  including revisions to the definitions of tier capital and tier capital applicable to basel iii 
in september  the group of governors and heads of supervisors of the basel committee on banking supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee  published its calibrated capital standards for major banking institutions  referred to as basel iii 
under these standards  when fully phased in on january   banking institutions will be required to maintain heightened tier common equity  tier capital  and total capital ratios  in amounts equal to  and of risk weighted assets  respectively  as well as maintaining a capital conservation buffer of of risk weighted assets 
the tier common equity and tier capital ratio requirements will be phased in incrementally between january  and january   the deductions from common equity made in calculating tier common equity will be phased in incrementally over a four year period commencing on january   and the capital conservation buffer will be phased in incrementally between january  and january  the basel committee also announced that a counter cyclical buffer of to of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented according to national circumstances as an extension of the conservation buffer 
on june   the us banking agencies requested comment on three proposed rules that  taken together  would establish an integrated regulatory capital framework implementing the basel iii regulatory capital reforms in the united states 
as proposed  the us implementation of basel iii would lead to significantly higher capital requirements and more restrictive leverage and liquidity ratios than those currently in place 
once adopted  these new capital requirements would be phased in over time 
additionally  the us implementation of basel iii contemplates that  for banking organizations with less than billion in assets  the ability to treat trust preferred securities as tier capital would be phased out over a year period 
comments to the proposed rules were requested by september  in order to begin the gradual integration of the proposed rules on january  us banking agencies have delayed implementation of the proposed rules as they continue weighing views expressed during the comment period 
the ultimate impact of the us implementation of the new capital and liquidity standards on the company and the bank is currently being reviewed 
at this point we cannot determine the ultimate effect that any final regulations  if enacted  would have upon our earnings or financial position 
in addition  important questions remain as to how the numerous capital and liquidity mandates of the dodd frank act will be integrated with the requirements of basel iii
