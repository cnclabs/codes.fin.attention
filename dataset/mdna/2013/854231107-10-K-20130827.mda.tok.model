item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading manufacturer of a variety of products and services for diverse commercial and industrial market segments 
we have five reportable segments food service equipment group  engraving group  engineering technologies group  electronics products group  and the hydraulics products group 
our business objective is to provide value added  technology driven solutions to our customers 
our strategic objective  which we refer to as focused diversity  are to identify those businesses which are best able to meet our objectives  and invest in them by taking advantage of both organic growth and acquisition opportunities and pursue operational excellence in order to improve operating margins and working capital management 
over the past months  we have taken two major steps in the implementation of our strategy 
the first was the divestiture at the end of the third quarter of fiscal of our air distribution products adp business segment 
we determined that the low margin  commodity orientation of that segment s products no longer suited our ongoing business objectives 
the second major step was the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal of meder electronic ag 
the acquisition  which more than doubled the size of our electronics products group allowed us to complement our existing electronics business with significantly broadened product line offerings  end user markets  and manufacturing support that will enhance our global footprint for sales coverage and profitable growth 
in addition to the continued implementation of our business strategy  we have successfully taken substantial measures over a period of more than four years to reduce our cost structure 
we have achieved this through company wide and targeted headcount reductions  low cost manufacturing and value added engineering initiatives  plant consolidations  procurement savings  and improved productivity in all aspects of our operations 
these measures have been the principal factors in allowing the company to significantly improve margins and profitability  even though sales have only recently returned to the levels existing before the onset of the macroeconomic recession 
in addition to the focus on improving our cost structure  we have improved the company s liquidity through better working capital management  and the sale of excess land and buildings 
this additional liquidity has enabled us to expand through acquisitions as evidenced by the completion of four strategic acquisitions in fiscal and the acquisition of meder in our net debt to capital ratio at june  was  even after spending nearly million to acquire meder in the first quarter of this fiscal year 
our business strategy emphasizes organic growth initiatives in addition to the completion of strategic acquisitions 
the development and execution of top line initiatives that provide opportunities for market share gains is a top priority for each of our businesses 
our business units are actively engaged in initiating new product introductions  expansion of product offerings through private labeling and sourcing agreements  geographic expansion of sales coverage  the development of new sales channels  leveraging strategic customer relationships  development of energy efficient products  new applications for existing products and technology  and next generation products and services for our end user markets 
during we encountered headwinds  including a soft european economy  negative year over year foreign exchange comparisons  and increased expense associated with our legacy defined benefit pension plan in the us the impact of the latter two items during was a million decrease in sales due to foreign exchange and a million reduction to income from operations as a result of the pension expense increases 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million during the third quarter relating to the settlement of litigation brought against the company 
this charge was substantially offset by the realization of a million gain resulting from the discontinuance of a retiree life insurance benefit 
during the third and fourth quarters  we saw some adverse effects from renewed uncertainty in the global economy  as overall organic sales growth slowed from the rate experienced earlier in the year 
because of the diversity of the company s businesses  end user markets and geographic locations  management does not use specific external indices to predict the future performance of the company  other than general information about broad macroeconomic trends 
each of our individual business units serves niche markets and attempts to identify trends other than general business and economic conditions which are specific to their businesses and which could impact their performance 
those units report pertinent information to senior management  which uses it to the extent relevant to assess the future performance of the company 
a description of any such material trends is described below in the applicable segment analysis 
we monitor a number of key performance indicators kpis including net sales  income from operations  backlog  effective income tax rate  and gross profit margin 
a discussion of these kpis is included within the discussion below 
we may also supplement the discussion of these kpis by identifying the impact of foreign exchange rates  acquisitions  and other significant items when they have a material impact on the discussed kpi 
we believe that the discussion of these items provides enhanced information to investors by disclosing their consequence on the overall trend in order to provide a clearer comparative view of the kpi where applicable 
for discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rates on kpis  the company calculates the impact as the difference between the current period kpi calculated at the current period exchange rate as compared to the kpi calculated at the historical exchange rate for the prior period 
for discussion of the impact of acquisitions  we isolate the effect to the kpi amount that would have existed regardless of our acquisition 
sales resulting from synergies between the acquisition and existing operations of the company are considered organic growth for the purposes of our discussion 
unless otherwise noted  references to years are to fiscal years 
consolidated results from continuing operations in thousands net sales gross profit margin restructuring costs gain on sale of real estate income from operations backlog realizable within year components of change in sales effect of acquisitions effect of exchange rates organic sales growth net sales in increased million  or  from levels 
of the increase  million  or was attributable to the acquisition related to electronics and million  or of organic growth  as organic sales increased across substantially all of our segments as a result of both improvements in end user markets and the success of our top line growth efforts 
sales growth was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of million 
net sales in increased million  or  from levels 
of the increase  million  or was attributable to organic growth  as organic sales increased across all of our segments as a result of both improvements in end user markets and the success of our top line growth efforts 
also factoring in our growth was an increase of million  or  resulting from our four acquisitions completed during unfavorable foreign exchange accounted for million against our year over year gains 
gross profit margin during  gross margin decreased to as compared to in this decrease is primarily a result of million in our meder purchase accounting expenses primarily related to a one time step up of acquired inventory to fair value  and a gross margin decline at engineering technologies offset by the improvement in food service equipment group and hydraulics 
during  gross margin was flat at as compared to  as lower gross margin in the food service equipment group offset increases across our other segments 
income from operations income from operations during decreased million  or compared to the decrease was primarily the result of gain on sale of real estate of million associated with the sales of real estate in brazil and million of purchase accounting expense associated with the meder acquisition during income from operations during increased million  or compared to this increase was driven by million associated with the sale of real estate in brazil  strong performances from engraving  electronics products  and hydraulics products groups 
the engraving group benefitted from a second consecutive record year of automotive platform work  while the electronics products and hydraulics products groups continue to demonstrate the impact of prior cost reductions combined with end user market recovery and entry into new markets and applications 
additionally  the engineering technologies group was bolstered by the acquisition of metal spinners impacting the full year of as compared to only three months of discussion of the performance of all of our groups is more fully explained in the segment analysis that follows 
income taxes the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was million  or an effective rate of  compared to million  or an effective rate of for the year ended june   and million  or an effective rate of for the year ended june  changes in the effective tax rates from period to period may be significant as they depend on many factors including  but not limited to  the amount of the company income or loss  the mix of income earned in the us versus outside the us  the effective tax rate in each of the countries in which we earn income  and any one time tax issues which occur during the period 
in  we expect to return to a more normal tax rate in the range of to based on an anticipated increase in us based taxable income within our overall business mix 
the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million related to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the third quarter  ii a benefit of million related to a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the united kingdom on prior period deferred tax liabilities recorded during the first and fourth quarters  iii a benefit of million from the reversal of a deferred tax liability that was determined to be no longer required during the third quarter and iv a benefit of million due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with beneficial tax rates 
the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the lapsing of the statute of limitations and re measurement of existing tax contingency reserves based on recently completed tax examinations  ii a benefit of million related to a decrease in the statutory tax rate in the united kingdom on prior period deferred tax liabilities recorded during the first quarter  and iii a benefit of million due to the mix of income earned in jurisdictions with beneficial tax rates 
the company income tax provision from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended june  was impacted by the following items i a benefit of million from the reversal of income tax contingency reserves that were determined to be no longer needed due to the expiration of applicable limitation statutes  ii a benefit of million related primarily to the retroactive extension of the r d credit recorded during the second quarter  and iii a benefit totaling million as part of the deferred tax provision related to a change in the estimated state rate used to calculate the deferred balances 
capital expenditures in general  our capital expenditures over the longer term are expected to be approximately equivalent to our annual depreciation costs 
in  capital expenditures of million began shifting back to our historical trend as we made strategic investments which supported productivity improvements  geographic expansion  and development of new product offerings 
backlog total backlog includes amounts realizable beyond one year 
at june  total backlog increased million or from million to million when compared to fiscal the increase was driven by electronics where the backlog increased primarily due to backlog associated with the acquired meder business and engineering technologies where the backlog increased offset by decrease in food service equipment  hydraulics products group  and engraving groups 
segment analysis in thousands food service equipment compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales for fiscal increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
the top line growth includes the negative effect of foreign exchange rates of million in sales 
the refrigerated solutions walk in coolers and freezers and refrigerated cabinets and specialty solutions groups grew approximately and year over year  respectively  while the cooking solutions group net sales declined by year over year 
the refrigeration business continues to see strong sales to our quick service restaurant chain customers  and we are seeing continued traction in the dollar store segment 
this strength is offset by weakness in the drug retail segment as new store construction is at reduced levels 
the specialty solutions group growth was driven by double digit growth in the specialty merchandising and custom fabrication businesses through market share gains 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in the global beverage pump business due to soft demand  particularly in the european markets 
the sales decline in the cooking solutions group was driven by the bki division which experienced weakness in the us and uk which were negatively impacted by reduced capital spending in the supermarket segments  and a difficult year over year comparison due to a significant roll out to a major us supermarket chain in fiscal this decline was partially offset by growth in the cooking group which primarily serves the restaurant and convenience store markets 
the new standex food service culinary development center was opened in the dallas area in the rd quarter to be used for training  product development and key customer sales visits 
the new facility also serves as the new cooking group headquarters 
income from operations for fiscal declined million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this includes the negative effect of foreign exchange rates of million 
the group s return on sales decreased from to in the current year 
the positive impact of the year over year volume increase was partially offset by a combination of adverse product and customer mix changes  marketing cost increases and increased warranty costs in the beverage business 
the beverage business warranty issues have been largely resolved in q and are not expected to have a significant impact on future results 
in response to these margin challenges  the group has implemented multiple productivity improvement actions  including cost reductions through product redesign  metal cost reductions  and staff reductions  coupled with selective price increases 
net sales for the year ended june  increased million  or  from the same period one year earlier 
this includes a minor negative effect of foreign exchange rates of million in sales 
the refrigerated solutions walk in coolers and freezers and refrigerated cabinets and cooking solutions groups grew approximately and year over year  respectively  while the other food service equipment businesses grew net sales by 
the refrigeration business continues to see strong sales across the board to our quick service restaurant chain customers  and we are seeing continued traction in the dollar store segment where we are growing market share and the customer base 
from a product standpoint  we continue to see double digit growth in our value line products and rack refrigeration systems 
sales in cooking solutions were driven by us business at bki  whereas aai was negatively impacted by lower sales to major quick service chains and lower sales to uk retail accounts due to the macroeconomic conditions impacting that market 
our equity investment and distribution agreement with giorik spa  an italian manufacturer of combi ovens  has been well received by both the us and uk customers 
income from operations for fiscal increased million  or  when compared to the same period one year earlier 
the group s return on sales decreased from to in the prior year 
the positive impact of the year over year volume increase was partially offset by a combination of reduced volume  adverse product and channel mix changes  coupled with higher commodity prices earlier in the year and increased warranty costs at cooking solutions 
additionally  productivity was negatively impacted by the integration of kool star product lines into our master bilt facility in mississippi  and the integration of tri star manufacturing operations into our nogales  mexico facility 
however  these issues were largely corrected at the end of the fourth quarter 
in response to these margin challenges  the group has implemented price increases and multiple productivity improvement actions  including freight and metal cost reduction efforts 
engraving compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales for the fiscal year remained flat  when compared to the prior year 
during the fourth quarter sales to automotive oem s in the mold texturing market softened as compared to the very strong sales level achieved in the prior year quarter 
the decline in mold texturizing sales occurred primarily in north america mold texturizing while both the europe and china markets showed year over year growth 
during the fourth quarter sales in the innovent core forming tool and rolls  plates and machinery businesses also declined 
we do expect strengthening in north american mold texturizing sales in fiscal as we have reasonable visibility of new launch awards at our global automotive customers 
income from operations in fiscal year decreased by million  or  when compared to the prior year 
unfavorable performance was primarily driven by one time costs related to moving our brazilian operations  start up of our mt korea operation and lower fourth quarter demand in north america 
net sales for the fiscal year increased million  or  from levels at million compared to million in the prior year 
foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact on sales of million in fiscal year our mold texturizing businesses continued to demonstrate strong top line growth on a global basis due to the release of new automotive programs  which also created an improved product mix due to their generally higher margins 
income from operations in increased by million  or  when compared to during  we demonstrated our ability to favorably leverage sales growth as we expand the use of lean enterprise techniques 
we also continued to develop and globalize market leading technology in order to further improve profitability 
engineering technologies compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the fiscal year increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
sale growth in the aerospace and energy markets was offset by declines in the oil and gas segment 
the aerospace segment increased from prior year levels due to strong demand for unmanned space launch vehicles 
the land based gas turbine business improved significantly year over year due to strong demand from several of our oem customers 
sales to the oil and gas segment were down as the prior year benefited from several very large offshore platform projects which did not repeat in the current year 
the aviation market was down from prior year due to order phasing and the defense market was up slightly over the prior year 
income from operations in the fiscal year decreased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to the impact of reduced sales in the higher margin oil and gas markets 
net sales in the fiscal year increased million or  when compared to the prior year 
the increase is a result of the full year impact of the acquisition of metal spinners group 
negative organic growth of occurred in our legacy businesses as increases in the aerospace segment at spincraft were more than offset by declines in the energy  aviation and the defense markets 
as expected  the energy business was down significantly year over year as one of our major customers implemented an inventory correction program 
for the fiscal year ending june   income from operations increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase was driven by full year impact of the acquisition of metal spinners 
the improvement from metal spinners was offset by the impact of reduced sales volume at spincraft 
electronics products compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the fiscal year increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase includes the impact of million from the acquisition of meder and million of organic growth driven by increased sales from the new sensor programs launched over the past months partially offset by lower sales in magnetic products 
income from operations in the fiscal year increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this increase was primarily driven by the meder acquisition 
the integration of the meder acquisition continued successfully throughout the year with a focus on identifying and implementing both sales and cost synergies 
thus far  we identified and had substantially implemented by the end of the fiscal year approximately million of cost synergies 
these cost synergies were primarily the result of procurement savings and the consolidation of our sales and production facilities in china into a single facility 
income from the meder acquisition was accretive to earnings inclusive of million in purchase accounting expenses primarily related to a one time step up of inventory to fair value 
electronics net sales increased million  or in when compared to the prior year 
sales growth was negatively impacted during the first three quarters of as we experienced soft demand for reed switches  particularly in the asia pacific region  and soft demand from a number of larger oem accounts for sensors and magnetic products 
however  sales strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter as we benefited from a number of new products and customer project launches within the automotive  appliance  medical  and hvac sensor and magnetic markets and strengthening demand for reed switches 
income from operations in increased million  or  compared to the year over year improvement was the result of the sales increase as well as the impact of various material and labor cost savings particularly within the north american businesses 
the higher sales level and the various cost reduction initiatives drove operating income margin from in to for hydraulics products compared to compared to change change net sales income from operations operating income margin net sales in the fiscal year increased million  or  when compared to the prior year 
continued market share gains in the north american refuse market coupled with growth in the aftermarket segment was offset by softness in the traditional north american dump truck and trailer and export markets 
in many cases end users continue to hold off in making capital investments until absolutely necessary 
we have successfully penetrated several large roll off container refuse vehicle oem s by leveraging our engineering expertise and low cost manufacturing position provided by our factory in tianjin  china 
we also have recently launched a new telescopic cylinder product line for the garbage truck refuse markets that two large oem customers are now utilizing 
we are currently expanding the capacity of our chinese facility as we expect to continue to drive sales growth by utilizing our low cost position to further penetrate both rod and telescopic cylinder product applications for our global customer base 
this expansion geographically includes australia  south america  germany  and central america 
income from operations in the fiscal year increased million or when compared to the prior year 
this increase in annual income from operations can be attributed to cost containment and improvements in both process and productivity during the year in both north america and china 
net sales in for the hydraulics products group increased million  or when compared to diversification into other markets in was a major contributor to the growth  as demonstrated by market share gains at several north american refuse market oems 
the manufacturing facility in tianjin  china was also a factor in our top line growth  as this facility began producing both rod and telescopic cylinders for global customers 
the ability to offer our engineering expertise on a global basis combined with manufacturing locations in the united states and a low cost operation in china allowed us to penetrate markets where we previously could not be competitive 
expansion of business geographically into areas such as southeast asia  australia  central america and south america contributed to the increase outside of our historical focus on the north american market 
income from operations for increased million or when compared to this increase in annual income from operations can be attributed to leveraging the top line growth  cost containment and process and productivity improvements 
corporate  restructuring and other compared to compared to change change income loss from operations corporate gain on sale of real estate restructuring corporate expenses in the fiscal year decreased million  or when compared to the prior year 
the decrease is primarily driven by a gain of million resulting from the termination of the retiree life insurance benefit and lower incentive compensation expense of million partially offset by an increase of million in pension expense and million of legal settlement costs  presented in item legal proceedings 
corporate expenses in increased million  or as compared to  driven primarily by increased management bonus and stock compensation expense related to exceeding performance targets for the year 
the company recorded a gain of million during related to the sale of an engraving group facility in sao paolo  brazil 
restructuring expenses reflect costs associated with the company s efforts to continuously improve operational efficiency and expand globally in order to remain competitive in the end user markets we serve 
each year the company incurs costs for actions to size its businesses to a level appropriate for current economic conditions and to improve its cost structure to improve our competitive posture and operating margins 
restructuring expenses result from numerous individual actions implemented across the company s various operating divisions on an ongoing basis which include costs for moving facilities to low cost locations  starting up plants after relocation  curtailing downsizing operations because of changing economic conditions  and other costs resulting from asset redeployment decisions 
shutdown costs include severance  benefits  stay bonuses  lease and contract terminations  and asset write downs 
in addition to the costs of moving fixed assets  start up and moving costs include employee training and relocation 
vacant facility costs include maintenance  utilities  property taxes  and other costs 
restructuring expense of million in the fiscal year is primarily composed of million in the engraving group for ongoing headcount reductions in our european operations and the relocation of our brazil facility  and million in electronics  where we are eliminating redundant positions due to the meder acquisition 
during the company incurred restructuring expense of million 
these expenses primarily related to the relocation of tri star manufacturing operations to nogales  mexico  the consolidation of kool star into our master bilt operations in mississippi  and ongoing headcount reductions in our european engraving operations 
the company currently expects to incur between and million of restructuring expense in  including the cost to complete actions initiated before the end of and actions anticipated to be approved and initiated during discontinued operations in december  we decided to divest the adp business unit 
in connection with this decision  the company adjusted the carrying value of adp s assets to their net realizable value based on a range of expected sale prices 
as a result  the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of million and impairment charges of million to fixed assets 
on march   we completed the sale of adp to a private equity buyer for consideration of million consisting of million in cash and a million note secured by first mortgages on three adp facilities 
during the quarter ended march   additional pre tax charges of million were taken in connection with the sale 
these charges related primarily to the impairment of a non cancellable lease liability that the buyer elected not to assume as part of the purchase 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold the two adp facilities retained by us in the transaction for a gain of million

capital structure on january   the company entered into a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement  or new facility  which can be increased by the company by an amount of up to million  in accordance with specified conditions contained in the agreement 
the new facility also includes a million sublimit for swing line loans and a million sublimit for letters of credit 
the new credit facility replaced the credit agreement  which was scheduled to mature in september under the terms of the credit agreement  we will pay a variable rate of interest and a commitment fee on available  but unused  amounts under the new facility 
the amount of the commitment fee will depend upon both the undrawn amount remaining available under the new facility and the company s funded debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement ratio at particular points in time 
as our funded debt to ebitda ratio increases  the commitment fee will increase 
amounts borrowed under the new facility may be in the form of either base rate or eurodollar rate loans 
the rate of interest on base rate loans shall be the higher of i the federal funds rate plus of  ii the prime rate announced by rbs citizens  n 
a 
or iii the london interbank offered rate libor plus of the rate in effect shall be referred to as the base rate  plus an additional amount based upon the company s debt to ebitda ratio 
the rate of interest on eurodollar rate loans shall be the libor rate which corresponds to the interest period either one  two  three or six months selected by the company  plus an additional amount based upon the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
swing line loans shall bear interest at the base rate  plus an additional amount based upon the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio 
as the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio increases  the additional amount will also increase 
the new facility expires in january  and contains customary representations  warranties and restrictive covenants  as well as specific financial covenants 
the company s current financial covenants under the facility are as follows interest coverage ratio the company is required to maintain a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes  as adjusted adjusted ebit per the credit agreement  to interest expense for the trailing twelve months of at least adjusted ebit per the credit agreement specifically excludes extraordinary and certain other defined items such as non cash restructuring and acquisition related charges up to million  and goodwill impairment

funds borrowed under the new facility may be used for the repayment of debt  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions so long as certain conditions  including a specified funded debt to ebitda leverage ratio is maintained  and other general corporate purposes 
our primary cash requirements in addition to day to day operating needs include interest payments  capital expenditures  and dividends 
our primary sources of cash for these requirements are cash flows from continuing operations and borrowings under the new facility 
we expect to spend between and million on capital expenditures during  and expect that depreciation and amortization expense will be between and million and and million  respectively 
in order to manage our interest rate exposure  we are party to million of floating to fixed rate swaps 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
the following table sets forth our capitalization at june  in thousands long term debt less cash net cash debt stockholders equity total capitalization stockholders equity increased year over year primarily as a result of changes in unrealized pension gains of million 
also affecting equity were net income of million  dividends of million  unfavorable foreign currency movements of million  and favorable changes in the fair value of derivative instruments of million 
the remaining changes are attributable to treasury stock activity  offset by the additional paid in capital increases associated with stock based compensation in the current year 
the company net cash debt to capital percentage decreased from to in due to million paid for the meder acquisition  the contribution of current year net income to retained earnings  and the aforementioned changes to accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from unrealized pension gains 
we sponsor a number of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement plans 
the fair value of the company us pension plan assets was million at june  and the projected benefit obligation in the us was million at that time 
in june  the moving ahead for progress in the st century map bill was signed into law by congress 
based on changes in pension funding provisions under map  we made a million contribution during july due to its favorable treatment under the bill and retroactive treatment under the pension protection act ppa 
as a result of this contribution and an additional million contribution made in june  the plan is funded under ppa rules at june   and we do not expect to make mandatory contributions to the plan until we do not expect contributions to our other defined benefit plans to be material in the company s pension plan for us salaried employees was frozen as of december   and participants in the plan ceased accruing future benefits 
the company s pension plan for us hourly employees was frozen for substantially all participants as of july   and replaced with a defined contribution benefit plan 
based on changes to the plan in  the company expects to record a reduction in us non cash pension plan expense of million as compared to  which will be partially offset by increased expenses associated with the implementation of the defined contribution benefit program 
we have evaluated the current and long term cash requirements of our defined benefit and defined contribution plans as of june  and determined our operating cash flows from continuing operations and available liquidity are expected to be sufficient to cover the required contributions under erisa and other governing regulations 
we have an insurance program for certain retired key executives that have underlying policies with a cash surrender value at june  of million and are reported net of loans of million for which we have the legal right of offset 
these policies have been purchased to fund supplemental retirement income benefits 
contractual obligations of the company as of june  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations estimated interest payments post retirement benefit payments total estimated interest payments are based upon effective interest rates as of june   and include the impact of interest rate swaps 
see item a for further discussions surrounding interest rate exposure on our variable rate borrowings 
post retirement benefit payments are based upon current benefit payment levels 
at june   we had million of non current liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the timing of future payments related to these obligations 
off balance sheet items in march  the company sold substantially all of the assets of the adp business 
in connection with the divestiture  the company remained the lessee of adp s philadelphia  pa facility and administrative offices  with the purchaser subleasing a fractional portion of the building at current market rates 
in connection with the transaction  the company recognized a lease impairment charge of million for the remaining rental expense 
the company s aggregate obligation with respect to the lease is million  of which million was recorded as a liability at june  additionally  the company remained an obligor on an additional facility lease that was assumed in full by the buyer  for which our aggregate obligation in the event of default by the buyer is million 
with the exception of the impaired portion of the philadelphia lease  the company does not expect to make any payments with respect to these obligations 
the buyer s obligations under the respective sublease and assumed lease are secured by a cross default provision in the purchaser s promissory note for a portion of the purchase price which is secured by mortgages on the adp real estate sold in the transaction 
in connection with the sale of the berean christian bookstores completed in august  we assigned all but one lease to the buyers 
during june  the berean business filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the berean assets were subsequently resold under section of the code 
the new owners of the berean business have negotiated lower lease rates and extended lease terms at certain of the leased locations 
we remain an obligor on these leases  but at the renegotiated rates and to the original term of the leases 
the aggregate amount of our obligations in the event of default is million at june   of which 
million is not recorded on our balance sheet as a liability based on management s assessment of the likelihood of loss 
we had no other material off balance sheet items at june   other than the operating leases summarized above 
other matters inflation certain of our expenses  such as wages and benefits  occupancy costs and equipment repair and replacement  are subject to normal inflationary pressures 
inflation for medical costs can impact both our reserves for self insured medical plans as well as our reserves for workers compensation claims 
we monitor the inflationary rate and make adjustments to reserves whenever it is deemed necessary 
our ability to manage medical costs inflation is dependent upon our ability to manage claims and purchase insurance coverage to limit the maximum exposure for us 
foreign currency translation our primary functional currencies used by our non us subsidiaries are the euro  british pound sterling pound  mexican peso  and chinese yuan 
during the current year  the euro  yuan  and peso have experienced increases but the pound decreased in value relative to the us dollar  our reporting currency 
since june  the euro has appreciated by  the yuan has appreciated by  the peso has appreciated by and the pound has depreciated by all relative to the us dollar 
these exchange values were used in translating the appropriate non us subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars at the end of the current year 
defined benefit pension plans we record expenses related to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates and assumed rates of returns 
based on actions taken to freeze benefits for substantially all participants in the plan and current assumptions  we are projecting a decrease of million  or per diluted share  of reduced expense related to our legacy us plan in compared to environmental matters to the best of our knowledge  we believe that we are presently in substantial compliance with all existing applicable environmental laws and regulations and do not anticipate any instances of non compliance that will have a material effect on our future capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
seasonality we are a diversified business with generally low levels of seasonality  however our fiscal third quarter is typically the period with the lowest level of activity 
employee relations the company has labor agreements with a number of union locals in the united states and a number of european employees belong to european trade unions 
there are two union contracts expiring during fiscal year one has already been successfully renegotiated 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all of our subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although  we believe that materially different amounts would not be reported due to the accounting policies described below  the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we have listed a number of accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
collectability of accounts receivable accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables includes evaluation of specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligation together with a general provision for unknown but existing doubtful accounts 
realizability of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory values on hand using specific aging categories  and records a provision for obsolete and excess inventory based on historical usage and estimated future usage 
as actual future demand or market conditions may vary from those projected by management  adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
realization of goodwill goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount of the asset 
the company s annual test for impairment is performed using a may st measurement date 
we have identified our reporting units for impairment testing as our twelve operating segments  which are aggregated into our five reporting segments as disclosed in note industry segment information 
the test for impairment is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s carrying value is compared to the implied fair value step 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as quoted market prices are not available for the company s reporting units  the fair value of the reporting units is determined using a discounted cash flow model income approach 
this method uses various assumptions that are specific to each individual reporting unit in order to determine the fair value 
in addition  the company compares the estimated aggregate fair value of its reporting units to its overall market capitalization 
our annual impairment testing at each reporting unit relied on assumptions surrounding general market conditions  short term growth rates  a terminal growth rate of  and detailed management forecasts of future cash flows prepared by the relevant reporting unit 
fair values were determined primarily by discounting estimated future cash flows at a weighted average cost of capital of 
an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points in the analysis would not result in the identification of any impairments 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  changes in assumptions could significantly affect our valuations and result in impairments in the future 
the most significant assumption involved in the company s determination of fair value is the cash flow projections of each reporting unit 
certain reporting units have been significantly impacted by the current global economic downturn and if the effects of the current global economic environment are protracted or the recovery is slower than we have projected estimates of future cash flows for each reporting unit may be insufficient to support the carrying value of the reporting units  requiring the company to re assess its conclusions related to fair value and the recoverability of goodwill 
as a result of our annual assessment  the company determined that the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets exceeded their respective carrying values 
therefore  no impairment charges were recorded in connection with our assessments during in connection with the divestiture of adp  the company determined that based on the net realizable value of the business in the transaction  the goodwill of the adp reporting unit was impaired 
as such  the company recognized million in impairment charges in discontinued operations during the second quarter of cost of employee benefit plans we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pensions and some postretirement benefits 
we record expenses relating to these plans based upon various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost trends 
the expected return on plan assets assumption of in the us is based on our expectation of the long term average rate of return on assets in the pension funds and is reflective of the current and projected asset mix of the funds and considers the historical returns earned on the funds 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets as well as our current expectations for long term rates of returns for our pension assets 
the us discount rate of reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by matching our expected benefit payments from a stream of aa or higher bonds available in the marketplace  adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions 
we review our actuarial assumptions  including discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  on at least an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
based on information provided by our actuaries and other relevant sources  we believe that our assumptions are reasonable 
the cost of employee benefit plans includes the selection of assumptions noted above 
a twenty five basis point change in the expected return on plan assets assumptions  holding our discount rate and other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million per year 
a twenty five basis point change in our discount rate  holding all other assumptions constant  would increase or decrease pension expense by approximately million annually 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding pension plans 
business combinations the accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  are based on management s estimates and assumptions  as well as other information compiled by management  including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values  the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill  or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
allocations of the purchase price for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocation 
during this measurement period  the company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that  if known  would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date 
all changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are included in current period earnings 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which clarifies the scope of the offsetting disclosures of asu this amendment requires disclosing and reconciling gross and net amounts for financial instruments that are offset in the balance sheet  and amounts for financial instruments that are subject to master netting arrangements and other similar clearing and repurchase arrangements 
we adopted asu effective january   which did not have a material impact on our disclosures in february  the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
this new guidance requires entities to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
in march  the fasb issued guidance on a parent s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity 
this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and changes in foreign currency exchange 
to reduce these risks  we selectively use  from time to time  financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
we have internal policies and procedures that place financial instruments under the direction of the treasurer and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes only 
the use of financial instruments for trading purposes except for certain investments in connection with the non qualified defined contribution plan or speculation is strictly prohibited 
the company has no majority owned subsidiaries that are excluded from the consolidated financial statements 
further  we have no interests in or relationships with any special purpose entities 
exchange risk we are exposed to both transactional risk and translation risk associated with exchange rates 
the transactional risk is mitigated  in large part  by natural hedges developed with locally denominated debt service on intercompany accounts 
we also mitigate certain of our foreign currency exchange rate risks by entering into forward foreign currency contracts from time to time 
the contracts are used as a hedge against anticipated foreign cash flows  such as dividend payments  loan payments  and materials purchases  and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
the fair values of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates from market rates would decrease the fair value of the contracts 
however  any such losses or gains would generally be offset by corresponding gains and losses  respectively  on the related hedged asset or liability 
at june  and  the fair value  in the aggregate  of the company s open foreign exchange was million and million respectively 
our primary translation risk is with the euro  british pound sterling  and chinese yuan 
a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the value of any these foreign currencies to the us dollar at june   would not result in a material change in our operations  financial position  or cash flows 
we do not hedge our translation risk 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates can affect our stockholders equity 
interest rate the company s effective rate on variable rate borrowings under the revolving credit agreement is and at june  and  respectively 
our interest rate exposure is limited primarily to interest rate changes on our variable rate borrowings 
from time to time  we will use interest rate swap agreements to modify our exposure to interest rate movements 
we currently have a million of floating to fixed rate swaps with terms ranging from two to five years 
these swaps convert our interest payments from libor to a weighted average rate of 
due to the impact of the swaps  an increase in interest rates would not materially impact our annual interest expense at june  concentration of credit risk we have a diversified customer base 
as such  the risk associated with concentration of credit risk is inherently minimized 
as of june   no one customer accounted for more than of our consolidated outstanding receivables or of our sales 
commodity prices the company is exposed to fluctuating market prices for all commodities used in its manufacturing processes 
each of our segments is subject to the effects of changing raw material costs caused by the underlying commodity price movements 
in general  we do not enter into purchase contracts that extend beyond one operating cycle 
while standex considers our relationship with our suppliers to be good  there can be no assurances that we will not experience any supply shortage 
the engineering technologies  food service equipment and electronics and hydraulics groups are all sensitive to price increases for steel products  other metal commodities and petroleum based products 
in the past year  we have experienced price fluctuations for a number of materials including steel  copper wire  other metal commodities  refrigeration components and foam insulation 
these materials are some of the key elements in the products manufactured in these segments 
wherever possible  we will implement price increases to offset the impact of changing prices 
the ultimate acceptance of these price increases  if implemented  will be impacted by our affected divisions respective competitors and the timing of their price increases
