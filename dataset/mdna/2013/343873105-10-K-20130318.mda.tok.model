overview our principal business is attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those deposits together with funds generated from ongoing operations and borrowings  primarily in originations and purchases of multi family residential properties and  to a lesser extent  one to four family focusing on mixed use properties  which are properties that contain both residential dwelling units and commercial units and commercial real estate mortgage loans  construction loans  primarily for residential properties  small business administration sba loans and other small business loans  mortgage loan surrogates such as mortgage backed securities  and us government securities  corporate fixed income securities and other marketable securities 
we also originate certain other consumer loans including overdraft lines of credit 
our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its interest earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the result of our interest rate margin  which is the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  adjusted for the difference in the average balance of interest earning assets as compared to the average balance of interest bearing liabilities 
we also generate non interest income from loan fees  service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage servicing fees  and other fees  income earned on bank owned life insurance boli  dividends on federal home bank of new york fhlb ny stock and net gains and losses on sales of securities and loans 
our operating expenses consist principally of employee compensation and benefits  occupancy and equipment costs  other general and administrative expenses and income tax expense 
our results of operations also can be significantly affected by our periodic provision for loan losses and specific provision for losses on real estate owned 
management strategy 
our strategy is to continue our focus on being an institution serving consumers  businesses  and governmental units in our local markets 
in furtherance of this objective  we intend to continue our emphasis on the origination of multi family residential mortgage loans  transition from a traditional thrift to a more commercial like banking institution  increase our commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens  maintain asset quality  manage deposit growth and maintain a low cost of funds through business banking deposits  municipal deposits through government banking  and new customer relationships via igobanking 
com  cross sell to lending and deposit customers  take advantage of market disruptions to attract talent and customers from competitors  manage interest rate risk and capital and manage enterprise wide risk 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively implement this strategy 
our strategy is subject to change by the board of directors 
multi family residential mortgage lending 
in recent years  we have emphasized the origination of higher yielding multi family residential mortgage loans 
during and  we reduced our emphasis on one to four family mixed use property and commercial real estate lending 
we expect to continue this emphasis on higher yielding multi family residential mortgage loans  while we continue to deemphasize one to four family mixed use property and commercial real estate lending 
the following table shows loan originations and purchases during  and loan balances as of december  loan loan balances originations and december  percent of purchases gross loans dollars in thousands multi family residential commercial real estate one to four family mixed use property one to four family residential co operative apartment construction small business administration taxi medallion commercial business and other total at december   multi family residential  commercial real estate  construction and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans  totaled of our gross loans 
our concentration in these types of loans has increased the overall level of credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio 
the greater risk associated with multi family  commercial real estate  construction and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans could require us to increase our provisions for loan losses and to maintain an allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans in excess of the allowance currently maintained 
transition to a more commercial like banking institution 
we established a business banking unit during staffed with a team of experienced commercial bankers 
we have developed a complement of deposit  loan and cash management products to support this initiative  and expanded these product offerings 
the business banking unit is responsible for building business relationships in order to obtain lower costing deposits  generate fee income  and originate commercial business loans 
building these business relationships could provide us with a lower costing source of funds and higher yielding adjustable rate loans  which would help us manage our interest rate risk 
increase our commitment to the multi cultural marketplace  with a particular focus on the asian community in queens 
our branches are all located in the new york city metropolitan area with particular concentration in the borough of queens 
queens in particular exhibits a high level of ethnic diversity 
an important element of our strategy is to service the multi ethnic consumer and business 
we have a particular concentration in the asian communities among them chinese and korean populations 
both groups are noted for high levels of savings  education and entrepreneurship 
in order to service these and other important ethnic groups in our market  our staff speaks more than languages 
we have an asian advisory board to help broaden our link to the community by providing guidance and fostering awareness of our active role in the local community 
our focus on the asian community in queens  where we have four branches  has resulted in us obtaining approximately million in deposits in these branches 
we also have over million of loans and lines of credit outstanding to borrowers in the asian community 
maintain asset quality 
by adherence to our conservative underwriting standards  we have been able to minimize net losses from impaired loans with net charge offs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we seek to maintain our loans in performing status through  among other things  disciplined collection efforts  and consistently monitoring non performing assets in an effort to return them to performing status 
to this end  we review the quality of our loans and report to the loan committee of the board of directors of the bank on a monthly basis 
we sold delinquent mortgage loans totaling million  delinquent mortgage loans totaling million  and delinquent mortgage loans totaling million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recorded net charge offs of million  million and million to the allowance for loan losses for the non performing loans that were sold during  and  respectively 
we realized gross gains of   and  on the sale of non performing mortgage loans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we realized gross losses of  and  on the sale of non performing mortgage loans for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we did not record any gross losses for the year ended december  there can be no assurances that we will continue this strategy in future periods  or if continued  we will be able to find buyers to pay adequate consideration 
non performing assets amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively 
manage deposit growth and maintain low cost of funds 
we have a relatively stable retail deposit base drawn from our market area through our full service offices 
although we seek to retain existing deposits and maintain depositor relationships by offering quality service and competitive interest rates to our customers  we also seek to keep deposit growth within reasonable limits and our strategic plan 
in order to implement our strategic plan  we have a business banking operation that we designed specifically to develop full business relationships thereby bringing in lower cost checking and money market deposits 
at december   deposits balances in the business sector are million 
we also have an internet branch  igobanking 
com  as a division of the bank  to compete for deposits from sources outside the geographic footprint of our full service offices 
in creating igobanking 
com  our strategy is to reduce our reliance on wholesale borrowings and reduce our funding costs 
deposit balances in igobanking 
com were million at december   at rates lower than our borrowings 
we have a government banking division  which prior to the merger operated as the commercial bank  as an additional source of deposits 
at december   deposits in our government banking division totaled million at rates below our average cost of funds 
we also obtain deposits through brokers and the cdars network 
management intends to balance its goal to maintain competitive interest rates on deposits while seeking to manage its overall cost of funds to finance its strategies 
we generally rely on our deposit base as our principal source of funding 
in addition  the bank is a member of the fhlb ny  which provides us with a source of borrowing 
we also utilize reverse purchase agreements  established with other financial institutions 
during  we realized a decrease in due to depositors of million  as core deposits increased million while certificates of deposit decreased million 
at the same time our borrowed funds increased by million as we looked to extend the maturities of our funding 
cross sell to lending and deposit customers 
a significant portion of our lending and deposit customers do not have both their loans and deposits with us 
we intend to continue to focus on obtaining additional deposits from our lending customers and originating additional loans to our deposit customers 
product offerings were expanded and are expected to be further expanded to accommodate perceived customer demands 
in addition  specific employees are assigned responsibilities of generating these additional deposits and loans by coordinating efforts between lending and deposit gathering departments 
take advantage of market disruptions to attract talent and customers from competitors 
the new york city market place has been dominated by large institutions  many of which recently have run into difficult situations due to the recessionary environment 
during this time period we have been able to attract talent from such large commercial banks 
that talent has brought with it significant business relationships 
we have been able to see a larger number of strong companies that have been caught in a retrenchment by their existing large institution 
we anticipate this environment remaining for some period of time 
we have in the past increased growth through acquisitions of financial institutions and branches of other financial institutions  and will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions that are  or are expected to be within a reasonable time frame  accretive to earnings  as well as evaluating the feasibility of opening additional branches 
we have in the past opened new branches 
one branch was opened in brooklyn in the first quarter of we plan to continue to seek and review potential acquisition opportunities that complement our current business  are consistent with our strategy to build a bank that is focused on the unique personal and small business banking needs of the multi ethnic communities we serve 
manage interest rate risk and capital 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk by actively reviewing the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the mix of loans we originate fixed or arm is determined in large part by borrowers preferences and prevailing market conditions 
we seek to manage the interest rate risk of our loan portfolio by actively managing our security portfolio and borrowings 
by adjusting the mix of fixed and adjustable rate securities  as well as the maturities of the securities  we have the ability to manage the combined interest rate sensitivity of our assets 
additionally  we seek to balance the interest rate sensitivity of our assets by managing the maturities of our liabilities 
the bank faces several minimum capital requirements imposed by federal regulation 
these requirements limit the dividends the bank is allowed to pay  including the payment of dividends to flushing financial corporation  and can limit the annual growth of the bank 
manage enterprise wide risk 
we identify measure and attempt to mitigate risks that affect  or have the potential to affect  our business 
due to the economic crisis and resulting increase in government regulation  there is greater demand for us to devote significant resources to risk management 
in april  a seasoned risk officer was hired to provide executive risk leadership  and an enterprise wide risk management program was implemented 
several enterprise risk management analytical products have been implemented which include key risk indicators 
our management of enterprise wide risk enables us to recognize and monitor risks and establish procedures to disseminate the risk information across our organization and to our board of directors 
the objective is to have a robust and focused risk management process capable of identifying and mitigating emerging threats to the bank s safety and soundness 
trends and contingencies our operating results are significantly affected by national and local economic and competitive conditions  including changes in market interest rates  the strength of the local economy  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
as short term interest rates have declined from through  we remained strategically focused on the origination of multi family residential mortgages and to a lesser extent  commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans 
as a result of this strategy  we were able to continue to achieve a higher yield on our mortgage portfolio than we would have otherwise experienced 
the new york city metropolitan area  our primary market for lending  was generally considered to be in a recession from december through the middle of in the new york city metropolitan area  building permits for one to four family residential properties  multi family residential properties  and commercial properties all declined over this time period to historically low levels 
while the number of building permits increased in  it remains below the level of the home price index for the new york city metropolitan area declined from the beginning of to the end of by approximately  and decreased an additional in the value of multi family and commercial properties showed similar price movements 
however  sale prices of multi family properties increased in sales of residential and commercial real estate in remained below the level of sales seen in building permits for one to four family residential properties  multi family residential properties  and commercial properties all declined over this time period to historically low levels 
this resulted in increased unemployment and declining property values 
the majority of our impaired loans are income producing residential properties located in the new york city metropolitan market 
due to the low vacancy rates for these types of properties  they have retained more of their value  thereby reducing their loss content 
while the national and local economies have shown signs of improvement since the middle of  unemployment has remained at elevated levels of in both december and  for the new york city region  according to the new york state department of labor 
these economic conditions can result in borrowers defaulting on their loans 
this deterioration in the economy has resulted in the balance of our non performing loans remaining at an elevated level  although non performing loans declined in non performing loans totaled million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
while non performing loans have remained elevated  we have not yet experienced a significant increase in foreclosed properties due to an extended foreclosure process in our market 
the extended foreclosure process in our market is due to the high number of foreclosure actions filed in the court system in the counties for which we are seeking foreclosure on delinquent mortgage loans 
we have not encountered significant issues with documentation relating to mortgages for which we are seeking foreclosure as we maintain custody of all loan documents and review them prior to providing them to our legal counsel to initiate the foreclosure action 
the deterioration in the economy also resulted in an increase in net charge offs from impaired loans  which increased to million in from million in and million in the majority of charge offs we recorded were to reduce the carrying value of impaired loans to their fair value 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million in compared to million in and million in we cannot predict the effect of these economic conditions on the company s future financial condition or operating results 
in addition  in response to the economic conditions in our market combined with the increase in non performing loans  we began tightening our underwriting standards in to reduce the risk associated with lending 
the following changes were made in our underwriting standards since to reduce the risk associated with lending on income producing real estate properties when borrowers requested a refinance of an existing mortgage loan when they had acquired the property or obtained their existing loan within two years of the request  we generally required evidence of improvements to the property that increased the property value to support the additional funds and generally restricted the loan to value ratio for the new loan to of the appraised value 
the debt coverage ratio was increased and the loan to value ratio decreased for income producing properties with fewer than ten units 
this required the borrower to have an additional investment in the property than previously required and provided additional protection should rental units become vacant 
borrowers who owned multiple properties were required to provide detail on all their properties to allow us to evaluate their total cash flow requirements 
based on this review  we may decline the loan application  or require a lower loan to value ratio and a higher debt coverage ratio 
income producing properties with existing rents that were at or above the current market rent for similar properties were required to have a higher debt coverage ratio to provide protection should rents decline 
borrowers purchasing properties were required to demonstrate they had satisfactory liquidity and management ability to carry the property should vacancies occur or increase 
the following changes were made in our underwriting standards since to reduce the risk on one to four family residential property mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit we discontinued originating home equity lines of credit without verifying the borrower s income 
this was done in two stages 
beginning in may  we began verifying the borrower s income when the home equity line of credit exceeded  beginning in october  we verified the income of all borrowers applying for a home equity line of credit 
we discontinued offering one to four family residential property mortgage loans to self employed individuals based on stated income and verifiable assets in june the following changes were made in our underwriting standards since to reduce the risk associated with business lending all borrowers obtaining a business loan were required to submit a complete financial information package  regardless of the amount of the loan 
previously  borrowers for sba express loans and other loans under  had been exempt from this requirement 
background checks on all borrowers and guarantors for business loans were expanded to identify and review information in more public records  including a search for judgments  liens  negative press articles  and affiliations with other entities 
the guarantee of related business entities providing cash flow to the borrowing entity became required for business loans 
the allowable percentage of inventory and accounts receivable pledged as collateral for a business loan was reduced 
we established specific risk acceptance criteria for private not for profit schools 
since  we have reduced our focus on commercial real estate and one to four family mixed use residential property mortgage loans  which represented million  or  of our mortgage loan originations and purchases in compared to million  or  in in addition to reducing our focus on commercial real estate lending  we further reduced our origination of smaller commercial real estate properties 
we also reduced our focus on construction lending  which we reduced from million in advances on existing loans in to million in advances on existing loans in  and new construction loan approvals from million in to none in we reduced our focus on these types of loans due to changes in market conditions  increasing delinquencies and losses incurred on delinquent loans associated with these types of loans 
the bank has cautiously resumed the origination of non owner occupied commercial real estate 
we also shifted our focus in multi family lending to larger properties 
our review of delinquent multi family mortgage loans revealed that the majority of our delinquent multi family mortgage loans were on smaller properties with fewer rental units 
we concluded that the more units a property had to rent  the less likely vacancies would cause a disruption in the property s cash flow 
while we primarily rely on originating our own loans  we purchased million of loans in compared to million in and million in we purchase loans when the loans complement our loan portfolio strategy 
loans purchased must meet our underwriting standards when they were originated 
the economic conditions we have experienced since the end of reduced loan demand in our market 
in addition  the tightening of our underwriting standards and the shift in our lending focus also contributed to our total loan originations and purchases remaining below pre recession levels 
loan originations were million and million for and  respectively 
during the three year period ended december   the allocation of our loan portfolio has remained fairly consistent 
the majority of our loans are collateralized by real estate  which comprised of our portfolio at december  compared to at december  and at december  multi family residential mortgage loans comprised  and of our loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
commercial real estate mortgage loans comprised  and of our loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
one to four family mixed use property mortgage loans comprised  and of loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
one to four family residential mortgage loans comprised  and of loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
due to depositors decreased million and million in and  respectively  compared to an increase of million in lower costing core deposits increased million in compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million during higher costing certificates of deposit decreased million during compared to increases of million and million during and  respectively 
brokered deposits represented  and of total deposits at december   and  respectively 
prevailing interest rates affect the extent to which borrowers repay and refinance loans 
in a declining interest rate environment  the number of loan prepayments and loan refinancing tends to increase  as do prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
call provisions associated with our investments in us government agency and corporate securities may also adversely affect yield in a declining interest rate environment 
such prepayments and calls may adversely affect the yield of our loan portfolio and mortgage backed and other securities as we reinvest the prepaid funds in a lower interest rate environment 
however  we typically receive additional loan fees when existing loans are refinanced  which partially offsets the reduced yield on our loan portfolio resulting from prepayments 
in periods of low interest rates  our level of core deposits also may decline if depositors seek higher yielding instruments or other investments not offered by us  which in turn may increase our cost of funds and decrease our net interest margin to the extent alternative funding sources  are utilized 
by contrast  an increasing interest rate environment would tend to extend the average lives of lower yielding fixed rate mortgages and mortgage backed securities  which could adversely affect net interest income 
in addition  depositors tend to open longer term  higher costing certificate of deposit accounts which could adversely affect our net interest income if rates were to subsequently decline 
additionally  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities generally contain interim and lifetime caps that limit the amount the interest rate can increase at re pricing dates 
during the year ended december   we extended the term of five business loans totaling million and mortgage loans totaling million  which we did not consider as non performing loans nor troubled debt restructured 
each of these loans was extended in accordance with our lending policies  which required the loans to be fully underwritten  and that each of the borrowers is current as to payments 
none of these borrowers was experiencing financial difficulties  and none received a below market interest rate or other favorable terms at the time the loans were extended 
therefore  we did not consider these loans to be troubled debt restructured 
we attempt to pursue the guarantor on all loans for which a loss has been incurred and for which a guarantee was obtained  when  after considering the benefits and costs  we have concluded we will be successful in recovering at least a portion of the loss we incurred 
the success of this pursuit is based on the assets the guarantor holds when we obtain a judgment 
during  we sought performance under guarantees on eight business loans  seeking judgments in excess of million  and real estate mortgage loans  seeking judgments in excess of million 
as of december   we had realized recoveries of less than million on mortgage loans  and had not received any recoveries on the business loans 
in addition  during the year ended december   we realized recoveries of approximately million on business loans and real estate mortgage loans for which we sought judgments prior to during  we sought performance under guarantees on nine business loans  seeking judgments in excess of million  and nine real estate mortgage loans  seeking judgments in excess of million 
as of december   we had realized recoveries of less than million on the business loans  and had not received any recoveries on the real estate mortgage loans 
in addition  during the year ended december   we realized recoveries of less than million on business loans and real estate mortgage loans for which we sought judgments prior to during our net interest margin improved four basis points to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period in this increase in the net interest margin resulted in a million increase in net interest income to million for the year ended december  from million in the comparable period in the improvement in the net interest margin for was primarily generated through a reduction in our funding costs  partially offset by a decline in the yield of our interest earning assets 
during we increased the average balance of borrowed funds by million to million for compared to million for  while reducing the cost of borrowed funds basis points to for the year ended december  from in the comparable period in at the same time the average balance of deposits decreased by million to  million for compared to  million for however  the average balance of lower costing deposits increased million while the average balance of higher costing certificates of deposit decreased million for the year ended december  from the comparable period in combining this shift to lower costing deposits with reductions in the rates we paid on all deposit types resulted in a basis point reduction in our cost of total deposits to for the year ended december  from in the comparable period in as a result of these changes to our funding mix  and a favorable interest rate environment  we were able to reduce our cost of funds basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we are unable to predict the direction of future interest rate changes 
approximately of our certificates of deposit accounts and borrowings reprice or mature during the next year  which could result in a decrease in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities 
also  in a decreasing interest rate environment  mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities with higher rates tend to prepay  which could result in a reduction in the yield on our interest earning assets 
interest rate sensitivity analysis a financial institution s exposure to the risks of changing interest rates may be analyzed  in part  by examining the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring the institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
accordingly  a positive gap may enhance net interest income in a rising rate environment and reduce net interest income in a falling rate environment 
conversely  a negative gap may enhance net interest income in a falling rate environment and reduce net interest income in a rising rate environment 
the table below sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  which are anticipated by the company  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown that reprice or mature during a particular period was determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to repricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
prepayment assumptions for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are based on our experience and industry averages  which generally range from to  depending on the contractual rate of interest and the underlying collateral 
money market accounts and savings accounts were assumed to have a withdrawal or run off rate of and  respectively  based on our experience 
while management bases these assumptions on actual prepayments and withdrawals experienced by us  there is no guarantee that these trends will continue in the future

does not include non interest bearing demand accounts totaling million at december  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar estimated maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates and may bear rates that differ in varying degrees from the rates that would apply upon maturity and reinvestment or upon repricing 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as arm loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a significant change in the level of interest rates  prepayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  and deposit withdrawal or run off levels  would likely deviate materially from those assumed in calculating the above table 
in the event of an interest rate increase  some borrowers may be unable to meet the increased payments on their adjustable rate debt 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis assumes that the nature of the company s assets and liabilities remains static 
interest rates may have an effect on customer preferences for deposits and loan products 
finally  the maturity and repricing characteristics of many assets and liabilities as set forth in the above table are not governed by contract but rather by management s best judgment based on current market conditions and anticipated business strategies 
interest rate risk our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in fair value of certain investments due to changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of financial investments such as loans and securities fluctuates inversely with changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the fair value of our interest earning assets which could adversely affect our results of operations if such assets were sold  or  in the case of securities classified as available for sale  decreases in our stockholders equity if such securities were retained 
we manage the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a continuous basis to maximize return and adjust our exposure to interest rate risk 
on a quarterly basis  management prepares the earnings and economic exposure to changes in interest rate report for review by the board of directors  as summarized below 
this report quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value should interest rates go up or down shocked basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other 
net portfolio value is defined as the market value of assets net of the market value of liabilities 
the market value of assets and liabilities is determined using a discounted cash flow calculation 
the net portfolio value ratio is the ratio of the net portfolio value to the market value of assets 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and net portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  various estimates regarding prepayment assumptions are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
at december   we were within the guidelines established by the board of directors for each interest rate level 
projected percentage change in net portfolio change in interest rate net interest income net portfolio value value ratio basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the relative amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to our consolidated statements of financial condition and consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   and  and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
average balances are derived from average daily balances

interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the yield of interest earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   partially offset by a million increase in the average balance of interest earning assets to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december  the basis point decline in the yield of interest earning assets was primarily due to a basis point reduction in the yield of the loan portfolio to for the twelve months ended december  from for the twelve months ended december   combined with a basis point decline in the yield on total securities to for the twelve months ended december  from for the comparable prior year period 
in addition  the yield of interest earning assets was negatively impacted by a million decrease in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio for the twelve months ended december  and a million increase in the average balances of the lower yielding securities portfolio for the twelve months ended december  these factors that reduced the yield were partially offset by a million decrease in the average balance of lower yielding interest earning deposits to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
the basis point decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to the current interest rate environment  as new loans are added at rates well below the portfolio average yield  and higher yielding loans are prepaid 
in addition  we experienced a significantly higher than average activity in loans refinancing during the basis point decrease in the securities portfolio was primarily due to the purchase of new securities at lower yields than the existing portfolio

in addition  the yield of interest earning assets was negatively impacted by a million increase in the combined average balances of the lower yielding securities portfolio and interest earning deposits for the twelve months ended december   both of which had a lower yield than the yield of total interest earning assets 
the basis point decrease in the loan portfolio was primarily due to the decline in the rates earned on new loan originations

liquidity  regulatory capital and capital resources our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed and other securities  and proceeds from sales of securities and loans 
deposit flows and mortgage prepayments  however  are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
at december   the bank had an approved overnight line of credit of million with the fhlb ny 
in total  as of december   the bank was able to borrow up to  million from the fhlb ny in federal home loan advances  letters of credit and overnight lines of credit 
as of december   the bank had million in fhlb ny advances 
in addition  flushing financial corporation has junior subordinated debentures with a face amount of million and a carrying amount of million which are included in borrowed funds and the bank had million in repurchase agreements to fund lending and investment opportunities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
management believes its available sources of funds are sufficient to fund current operations 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  which include cash and due from banks  overnight interest earning deposits and federal funds sold with original maturities of days or less 
the level of these assets is dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  a decrease of million from december  we also held marketable securities available for sale with a market value of million at december at december   we had commitments to extend credit principally real estate mortgage loans of million and open lines of credit for borrowers principally home equity loan lines of credit and business lines of credit of million 
since generally all of the loan commitments are expected to be drawn upon  the total loan commitments approximate future cash requirements  whereas the amounts of lines of credit may not be indicative of our future cash requirements 
the loan commitments generally expire in days  while construction loan lines of credit mature within months and home equity loan lines of credit mature within years 
we use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments 
our total interest expense and operating expense in were million and million  respectively 
we maintain three postretirement defined benefit plans for our employees a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan which was frozen as of september   a contributory medical plan  and a noncontributory life insurance plan 
the life insurance plan was amended to discontinue providing life insurance benefits to future retirees after january  and the medical plan was frozen as of january  we also maintain a noncontributory defined benefit plan for certain of our non employee directors  which was frozen as of january  the employee pension plan is the only plan that we have funded 
during  we made contributions to the employee pension plan totaling million  and incurred cash expenditures of million for the medical and life insurance plans and million for the non employee director plan 
we expect to pay similar amounts for these plans in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
the amounts reported in our financial statements are obtained from reports prepared by independent actuaries  and are based on significant assumptions 
the most significant assumption is the discount rate used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo for these plans 
the apbo is the present value of projected benefits that employees and retirees have earned to date 
the discount rate is a single rate at which the liabilities of the plans are discounted into today s dollars and could be effectively settled or eliminated 
the discount rate used is based on the citigroup pension liability index  and reflects a rate that could be earned on bonds over a similar period that we anticipate the plans liabilities will be paid 
an increase in the discount rate would reduce the apbo  while a reduction in the discount rate would increase the apbo 
during the past several years  when interest rates have been at historically low levels  the discount rate used for our plans has declined from for to for this decline in the discount rate has resulted in an increase in our apbo 
the company s actuaries use several other assumptions that could have a significant impact on our apbo and periodic expense for these plans 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  expected rate of return on plan assets  future increases in medical and life insurance premiums  turnover rates of employees  and life expectancy 
the accounting standards for postretirement plans involve mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility of earnings by allowing changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations to be amortized over time when actual results differ from the assumptions used  there are changes in the assumptions used  or there are plan amendments 
at december   our employee pension plan and medical and life insurance plan have unrecognized losses of million and million  respectively 
the non employee director plan has a million unrecognized gain  due to experience different from what had been estimated and changes in actuarial assumptions 
the employee pension plan s unrecognized loss is primarily attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years and the net decline in the market value of the pension plan s investments 
the medical and life insurance plans unrecognized loss is attributed to the reduction in the discount rate over the past several years 
in addition  the non employee director pension plan has an unrecognized past service liability of million due to plan amendments in prior years and the medical and life insurance plan have a million past service credit due to plan amendments 
the net after tax effect of the unrecognized gains and losses associated with these plans has been recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  resulting in a reduction of stockholders equity of million as of december  the change in the discount rate  the reduction in medical premiums and discontinued life insurance benefits to future retirees are the only significant changes made to the assumptions used for these plans for each of three years ended december  during the year ended december  the actual return on the employee pension plan assets was approximately half of the assumed return used to determine the periodic pension expense for that year 
during the years ended december  and the actual return approximated the assumed return used for each respective year 
the market value of the assets of our employee pension plan is million at december   which is million less than the projected benefit obligation 
we do not anticipate a change in the market value of these assets which would have a significant effect on liquidity  capital resources  or results of operations 
during  funds provided by the company operating activities amounted to million 
these funds  together with million provided by financing activities and million available at the beginning of  were utilized to fund net investing activities of million 
the company primary business objective is the origination and purchase of multi family residential properties  one to four family including mixed use properties and commercial real estate mortgage loans  and commercial  business and sba loans 
during the year ended december   the net total of loan originations and purchases less loan repayments and sales was million 
during the year ended december   the company also funded million in purchases of securities available for sale 
funds were primarily provided by increases of million in customer deposits and million in proceeds from maturities  sales  calls and prepayments of securities available for sale 
the company also used funds of million to purchase additional boli and million for dividend payments during the year ended december  at the time of the savings bank s conversion from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings bank  the savings bank was required by its primary regulator to establish a liquidation account which is reduced as and to the extent that eligible account holders reduce their qualifying deposits 
upon completion of the merger  the liquidation account was assumed by the bank 
the balance of the liquidation account at december  was million 
in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of the bank  each eligible account holder will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account 
the bank is not permitted to declare or pay a dividend or to repurchase any of its capital stock if the effect would be to cause the bank s regulatory capital to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account but approval of the nydfs superintendent is required if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years less prior dividends paid 
on july   as a result of the dodd frank act  the bank s primary regulator became the occ and flushing financial corporation s primary regulator became the federal reserve board of governors federal reserve 
prior to july   unlike the savings bank  flushing financial corporation was not subject to regulatory restrictions on the declaration or payment of dividends to its stockholders  although the source of such dividends could depend upon dividend payments from the savings bank 
however  flushing financial corporation was subject  to the requirements of delaware law  which generally limit dividends to an amount equal to the excess of its net assets the amount by which total assets exceed total liabilities over its stated capital or  if there is no such excess  to its net profits for the current and or immediately preceding fiscal year 
with the federal reserve becoming flushing financial corporation s primary regulator  flushing financial corporation became subject to the same regulatory restrictions on the declaration of dividends as the savings bank 
regulatory capital position 
under applicable regulatory capital regulations  the bank is required to comply with each of three separate capital adequacy standards leverage capital  tier i risk based capital and total risk based capital 
such classifications are used by the occ and other bank regulatory agencies to determine matters ranging from each institution s quarterly fdic deposit insurance premium assessments  to approvals of applications authorizing institutions to grow their asset size or otherwise expand business activities 
at december  and  the bank exceeded its three regulatory capital requirements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are integral to understanding the results of operations and statement of financial condition 
these policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
several of these policies require management s judgment to determine the value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company has established detailed written policies and control procedures to ensure consistent application of these policies 
the company has identified four accounting policies that require significant management valuation judgment the allowance for loan losses  fair value of financial instruments  goodwill impairment and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses 
an allowance for loan losses is provided to absorb probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by reviewing all impaired loans on an individual basis 
the remaining portfolio is evaluated based on the company historical loss experience  recent trends in losses  collection policies and collection experience  trends in the volume of non performing loans  changes in the composition and volume of the gross loan portfolio  and local and national economic conditions 
judgment is required to determine how many years of historical loss experience are to be included when reviewing historical loss experience 
a full credit cycle must be used  or loss estimates may be inaccurate 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available 
notwithstanding the judgment required in assessing the components of the allowance for loan losses  the company believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the policy has been applied on a consistent basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
fair value of financial instruments 
the company carries certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb accounting standards codification asc topic financial instruments and values those financial assets and financial liabilities in accordance with asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures 
asc topic defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc topic permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
management selected the fair value option for certain investment securities  primarily mortgage backed securities  and certain borrowings 
changes in the fair value of financial instruments for which the fair value election is made are recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
at december   financial assets and financial liabilities with fair values of million and million  respectively  are carried at fair value under the fair value option 
the securities portfolio also consists of mortgage backed and other securities for which the fair value election was not selected 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  with changes in fair value recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
if any decline in fair value for these securities is deemed other than temporary  the security is written down to a new cost basis with the resulting loss recorded in the consolidated statements of income 
during and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively  for certain private issue collateralized mortgage obligations 
financial assets and financial liabilities reported at fair value are required to be measured based on the following alternatives quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments level  significant other observable inputs level  or significant unobservable inputs level 
judgment is required in selecting the appropriate level to be used to determine fair value 
the majority of financial assets and financial liabilities for which the fair value election was made  and the majority of investments classified as available for sale  were measured using level inputs  which require judgment to determine the fair value 
the trust preferred securities held in the investment portfolio  and the company s junior subordinated debentures  were measured using level inputs due to the inactive market for these securities 
the private label collateralized mortgage obligations for which other than temporary impairment charges were recorded in and were valued using a level input at december  and a level input at december  goodwill impairment 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is tested for impairment  rather than amortized  on at least an annual basis 
for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing  management has concluded that the company has one reporting unit 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  there is no impairment of goodwill 
however  if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  further evaluation is required to determine if a write down of goodwill is required 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are to be used as the basis for measurement  when available 
other acceptable valuation methods include an asset approach  which determines a fair value based upon the value of assets net of liabilities  an income approach  which determines fair value using one or more methods that convert anticipated economic benefits into a present single amount  and a market approach  which determines a fair value based on the similar businesses that have been sold 
the company conducts its annual impairment testing of goodwill as of december the impairment testing as of december  and did not show an impairment of goodwill based on the fair value of the company 
income taxes 
the company estimates its income taxes payable based on the amounts it expects to owe to the various taxing authorizes ie federal  state and local 
in estimating income taxes  management assesses the relative merits and risks of the tax treatment of transactions  taking into account statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the company s tax position 
management also relies on tax opinions  recent audits  and historical experience 
the company also recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is required for deferred tax assets that the company estimates are more likely than not to be unrealizable  based on evidence available at the time the estimate is made 
these estimates can be affected by changes to tax laws  statutory tax rates  and future income levels 
contractual obligations payments due by period more less than than total year years years years in thousands borrowings deposits loan commitments capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension and other postretirement benefits deferred compensation plans total we have significant obligations that arise in the normal course of business 
we finance our assets with deposits and borrowings 
we also use borrowings to manage our interest rate risk 
we have the means to refinance these borrowings as they mature through financing arrangements with the fhlb ny and our ability to arrange repurchase agreements with broker dealers and the fhlb ny 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we focus our balance sheet growth on the origination of mortgage loans 
at december   we had commitments to extend credit and lines of credit of million for mortgage and other loans 
these loans will be funded through principal and interest payments received on existing mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  growth in customer deposits  and  when necessary  additional borrowings 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
at december   the bank had seventeen branches  eleven of which are leased 
the bank leases its branch locations primarily when it is not the sole tenant 
whether the bank will purchase its future branch locations will depend in part on the availability of suitable locations and the availability of properties 
in addition  we lease our executive offices 
we currently outsource our data processing  loan servicing and check processing functions 
we believe that this is the most cost effective method for obtaining these services 
these arrangements are usually volume dependent and have varying terms 
the contracts for these services usually include annual increases based on the increase in the consumer price index 
the amounts shown above for purchase obligations represent the current term and volume of activity of these contracts 
we expect to renew these contracts as they expire 
the amounts shown for pension and other postretirement benefits reflect our employee and directors pension plans  the supplemental retirement benefits of our president  and amounts due under our plan for medical and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
the amount shown in the less than year column represents our current estimate for these benefits  some of which are based on information supplied by actuaries 
the amounts shown in columns reflecting periods over one year represent our current estimate based on the past year s actual disbursements and information supplied by actuaries 
the amounts do not include an increase for possible future retirees or increases in health plan costs 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the amount required to increase the total amount to the projected benefit obligation of the directors plan and the medical and life insurance benefit plans  since these are unfunded plans and the underfunded portion of the employee pension plan 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
we currently provide a non qualified deferred compensation plan for officers who have achieved the level of at least senior vice president certain officers who had achieved the level of at least vice president are included in this plan under previously existing guidelines 
in addition to the amounts deferred by the officers  we match of their contributions  generally up to a maximum of of the officer s salary 
these plans generally require the deferred balance to be credited with earnings at a rate earned by certain mutual funds 
through december   employees could not receive a distribution from these plans until their employment is terminated 
the amounts shown in the columns for less than five years represent the estimate of the amounts we will contribute to a rabbi trust with respect to matching contributions under these plans  and the amounts to be paid from the rabbi trust to two executives who have retired 
the amount shown in the more than years column represents the current accrued liability for these plans  adjusted for the activity in the columns for less than five years 
this expense is provided in the consolidated statements of income  and the liability has been provided in the consolidated statements of financial condition
