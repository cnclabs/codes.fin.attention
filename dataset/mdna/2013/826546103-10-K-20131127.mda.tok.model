these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company provides this cautionary statement identifying important economic  political and technological factors  among others  the absence or effect of which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward looking statements and related assumptions 
such factors include the following the impact on business conditions in general  and on the demand for product in the a e industries in particular  of the global economic outlook  including the continuation of military spending at or near current levels and the availability of capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit  future business environment  including capital and consumer spending  competitive factors  including the ability to replace business which may be lost  metals and commodities price increases and the company s ability to recover such price increases  successful development and market introduction of new products and services  continued reliance on consumer acceptance of regional and business aircraft powered by more fuel efficient turboprop engines  continued reliance on military spending  in general  and or several major customers  in particular  for revenues  the impact on future contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans due to changes in actuarial assumptions  government regulations and the market value of plan assets  stable governments  business conditions  laws  regulations and taxes in economies where business is conducted  and the ability to successfully integrate businesses that may be acquired into the company s operations 
the company and its subsidiaries engage in the production and sale of a variety of metalworking processes  services and products produced primarily to the specific design requirements of its customers 
the processes and services include both conventional and precision forging  heat treating  coating  welding  and precision component machining 
the products include conventional and precision forged components  machined forged components  other machined metal components  and remanufactured component parts for turbine engines 
as of the end of fiscal  the company operates under one business segment sifco forged components 
the company endeavors to plan and evaluate its business operations while taking into consideration certain factors including the following i the projected build rate for commercial  business and military aircraft as well as the engines that power such aircraft  ii the projected build rate for industrial gas turbine engines  iii the projected maintenance  repair and overhaul schedules for commercial  business and military aircraft as well as the engines that power such aircraft  and iv anticipated exploration and production activities relative to oil and gas products 
the company operates within a cost structure that includes a significant fixed component 
therefore  higher net sales volumes are expected to result in greater operating income because such higher volumes allow the business operations to better leverage the fixed component of their respective cost structures 
conversely  the opposite effect is expected to occur at lower net sales and related production volumes 
a 
results of operations non gaap financial measures presented below is certain financial information based on our ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
references to ebitda mean earnings from continuing operations before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and references to adjusted ebitda mean ebitda plus  as applicable for each relevant period  certain adjustments as set forth in the reconciliations of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap 
the company presents ebitda and adjusted ebitda because it believes that they are useful indicators for evaluating operating performance and liquidity  including the company s ability to incur and service debt and it uses ebitda to evaluate prospective acquisitions 
although the company uses ebitda and adjusted ebitda for the reasons noted above  the use of these non gaap financial measures as analytical tools has limitations 
therefore  reviewers of the company s financial information should not consider them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of the company results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations include neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda reflects the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments  on indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda reflects any cash requirements for such replacements  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with the company s intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and adjusted ebitda  and neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda includes the payment of taxes  which is a necessary element of operations 
because of these limitations  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to the company to invest in the growth of its businesses 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or adjusted ebitda in isolation and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as net income  net sales  and operating profit  to measure operating performance 
neither ebitda nor adjusted ebitda is a measurement of financial performance under gaap  and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap 
the company s calculation of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies

distributions from the company s non operating irish subsidiary to the company may be subject to adverse tax consequences 
the company s operating activities of continuing operations provided million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million of cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in fiscal was primarily due to net income of million and million from the net impact of such non cash items as depreciation and amortization expense  deferred taxes  equity compensation expense and lifo effect 
these were offset by a million increase in operating assets 
these changes in the components of working capital do not reflect the impact of the opening balance sheet related to the acquisition of gaf and qaf and were due primarily to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i to support growth in the business  ii the relative timing of sales and collections from customers and iii the relative timing of payments to suppliers and tax authorities

in october  the company acquired qaf  a forging business  for approximately million at closing 
the acquisition was financed by borrowing approximately million from its bank  which borrowing consisted of a new million term loan and drawing approximately million from its revolving credit facility 
the balance of the acquisition was financed by the company issuing a million promissory note to the seller  which is payable by the company in november in october  the company entered into an amendment to its existing credit agreement with its bank increasing the maximum borrowing amount from million to million  of which million is a five year term loan and million is a five year revolving loan  secured by substantially all the assets of the company and its us subsidiaries and a pledge of of the stock of its non us subsidiaries

critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
the company maintains a formal policy  which requires at a minimum that a reserve be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the company considers a critical accounting estimate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value  which could result in future impairment charges 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business 
the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
for the purposes of impairment testing  goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the reporting entity expected to benefit from the business combination 
goodwill impairment testing involves the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit  which is determined by its discounted cash flows  with its carrying value 
the company allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets  other than goodwill  and liabilities 
any remaining unallocated fair value is then allocated to goodwill as its implied fair value 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
purchase price allocations the costs of business acquisitions are allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their respective fair value at the time of the acquisition 
the determination of fair values typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
in determining fair value  management may develop a number of possible future cash flow scenarios to which probabilities are judgmentally assigned and evaluated 
this allocation process impacts the company s reported assets and liabilities and future net income 
defined benefit pension plan expense the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these three defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans 
one significant assumption in determining net pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on i the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans investment portfolios and ii the targeted allocation of the respective plans assets 
the expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and market performance 
should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed expected rate  the company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and  accordingly  on its related future net pension expense 
another significant assumption in determining the net pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate for each plan is determined  as of the fiscal year end measurement date  using prevailing market spot rates from an appropriate yield curve with maturities corresponding to the expected timing date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans 
such corresponding spot rates are used to discount future years projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value 
a composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot rates 
the discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date 
deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standards codification asc guidance related to accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
e
