part item description of business corporate background uranerz energy corporation uranerz  company  we  us and our was incorporated under the laws of the state of nevada on may  on july   we changed our name from carleton ventures corp 
to uranerz energy corporation 
our executive and operations office is located at east e street  po box  casper  wyoming po our administrative office is located at suite west pender street  vancouver  british columbia  canada vc v the telephone number for our executive office is the telephone number for our administrative office is our common stock is traded on the nyse mkt and the toronto stock exchange under the symbol urz and on the frankfurt stock exchange under the symbol ue 
history uranerz was relatively inactive from until when it acquired mineral prospecting permits in saskatchewan  mineral licenses in mongolia and mining claims and leases in wyoming 
the company commenced exploration in and has continued through in we filed uranium mining applications for a project in wyoming 
in we sold our mongolian properties and have terminated exploration in saskatchewan 
we continued to acquire additional mineral properties and conduct exploration drilling while pursuing mining permits in wyoming 
in we received regulatory approvals for the construction of our first mine  the nichols ranch isr uranium project  and began construction in august of that year 
our business we are a united states based uranium company focused on constructing an in situ recovery isr uranium facility 
isr is a mining process that uses a leaching solution to extract uranium from underground sandstone hosted uranium deposits  it is the generally accepted extraction technology used in the powder river basin area of wyoming 
we are currently constructing our first mine  our nichols ranch isr uranium project in the powder river basin area of wyoming 
we expect to complete construction in the last half of we control a large strategic property position in the central powder river basin of wyoming 
our management team has specialized expertise in the isr uranium mining method  and a record of licensing  constructing  and operating isr uranium projects 
information regarding the location of and access to our wyoming properties  together with the history of operations  present condition and geology of each of our properties  is presented in item of this annual report under the heading description of properties 
we have no proven or probable reserves as such terms are defined in the united states securities and exchange commission s industry guide guide 
all of our properties are exploratory in nature 
we are principally focused on the exploitation of our properties in the powder river basin but we continually investigate other uranium opportunities as they arise 
in anticipation of receiving all of the approvals necessary to begin production at nichols ranch  we commenced a marketing program for conditional sales of uranium from the nichols ranch isr project in late in july  we entered into a sales agreement with exelon generation company  llc exelon for the sale of uranium over a five year period at defined prices 
the agreement with exelon was subsequently amended to defer the delivery schedule by a year and adjust the pricing terms 
on january  we entered into a second supply agreement with exelon for the sale of uranium over an additional five year period commencing in  at defined prices adjustable for inflation 
in august of  we entered into what was then our second contract for the sale of uranium to another united states nuclear utility  also over a five year period  with a pricing structure  as amended  that references both spot and fixed prices and includes floor and ceiling prices 
that agreement was also subsequently amended to defer the original five year delivery period by a year  reduce the annual volumes to be supplied  and adjust the pricing terms 
the amendment included the cancellation of the first year s delivery quantity if we are unable to deliver during the first delivery year of the contract 
these three long term contracts for the sale of uranium are with two of the largest nuclear utilities in the united states 
these three agreements do not represent a substantial portion of our targeted uranium production and our business is not substantially dependent on these agreements 
the nichols ranch isr uranium project originally comprised our nichols ranch unit and our hank unit 
under the original plan  a central processing plant was to have been built at nichols ranch and a satellite processing facility built at hank 
in march  we commenced preparation of the environmental permit and license applications for our jane dough unit  which is adjacent to our nichols ranch unit and which can share its infrastructure 
this will provide us with the option to revise our original plan of operations by bringing our jane dough unit into production before the hank unit  at our nichols ranch isr uranium project 
due to the close proximity  jane dough fluids could be delivered directly to our nichols ranch processing facility by pipeline  thus eliminating the need for larger capital outlay as would be required to explore hank 
our jane dough unit includes the doughstick  south doughstick and north jane properties 
additional units may be added to the mine plan as we assess our geological data 
we plan to continue the exploration  enhancement and strategic portfolio planning of our other wyoming powder river basin properties through a number of strategies including acquisitions or exchanges with other isr uranium mining companies in the area 
in december  we received a permit to mine from the wyoming department of environmental quality land quality division wdeq lqd 
in july  we received our source material license from the united states nuclear regulatory commission and immediately began construction of our nichols ranch isr uranium project with an original start up date of early central processing plant construction will be substantially complete mid  and production is expected to commence in the second half of  after our deep disposal wells are installed 
the jane dough exploration option described above will be progressed while mining the nichols ranch unit 
in november  we signed a processing agreement with cameco resources cameco  a wholly owned wyoming subsidiary of cameco corporation  the world s largest publicly traded uranium company 
under the agreement  we agreed to deliver uranium loaded resin produced from our nichols ranch facility to cameco s smith ranch highland uranium mine for final processing into dried uranium concentrate packaged for shipping to a converter 
cameco s smith ranch highland mine is located in the powder river basin of wyoming approximately air miles south of our nichols ranch unit 
mining the jane dough unit is compatible with this plan 
the agreement is for a fixed term with a variable starting date depending on when we enter into production 
under the agreement  we and cameco stipulate both a minimum quantity of resins and a maximum quantity of resins which will be delivered by us and processed by cameco 
under the terms of the agreement  we may have all or substantially all of the resins produced at nichols ranch in its initial few years of production processed by cameco 
in the event that we fail to deliver the minimum quantities stipulated by the agreement  we will be required to compensate cameco a stipulated sum of liquidated damages 
in september we submitted an application to the wyoming business council wbc for a  loan under the wyoming industrial development revenue bond program 
if approved  the bond would have a seven year term and an interest rate of per annum 
we will be required to make interest only payments during the first year and in the following years the debt would be amortized to include payments of principal and interest 
the full approval process for the bond application is expected to take several months 
our focus is on construction of our processing facility and installation of the environmental monitor  production and deep disposal wells for the nichols ranch isr uranium project 
at the present time  the production wells at the first wellfield have been substantially completed and the remaining wells are expected to be completed during the first half of the individual wells in the wellfield will be connected to header houses that are connected to the central processing plant with trunk lines that have been fused and buried 
these trunk lines will carry solutions between the header houses and the central processing plant 
the central processing plant is approximately complete with tanks  pumps  ion exchange columns  sand filters and ancillary equipment fully installed 
installation of the process piping  electrical controls and the control room is ongoing 
the nichols ranch isr uranium project is expected to be operational during the fourth quarter of regulatory milestones are being pursued in order to meet start up requirements following completion of the central processing plant and wellfield construction activities  and installation of requisite deep disposal wells 
the drilling pads for the two deep disposal wells have recently been completed and drilling is ready to begin 
the two deep disposal wells will be drilled and completed before the start of production 
recent corporate developments the following significant corporate developments occurred during our fiscal year ended december  we issued  shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of certain outstanding stock options for gross cash proceeds of  we continued our exploration program in wyoming see details under the section heading item description of properties  we obtained a deep disposal well permit and continued construction of our nichols ranch isr uranium project  we applied for  and received first level approval of  a  industrial development revenue bond financing from the state of wyoming  we continued the licensing and permitting process to construct and operate isr uranium facilities on our jane dough unit  and we hired key operational personnel to participate in construction management  and development of standard operating procedures and training plans 
our focus during the fiscal year ended december  was on exploration in the powder river basin  licensing the jane dough unit  construction of a processing facility and installation of the environmental monitor and production wells for the first wellfield at the nichols ranch isr uranium project 
competition our industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other mining and exploration companies in connection with the acquisition of uranium mineral properties and the equipment  materials and personnel necessary to explore and develop such properties 
there is competition for the limited number of uranium acquisition opportunities  some of which is with other companies having substantially greater financial resources  staff and facilities than we do 
as a result  we may have difficulty acquiring attractive exploration properties  staking claims related to our properties  and exploring and developing our properties 
due to our limited capital and personnel  we are at a competitive disadvantage compared to many other companies with regard to exploration and  if warranted  development of mining properties 
we believe that competition for acquiring mineral prospects will continue to be intense in the future 
the availability of funds for exploration is sometimes limited  and we may find it difficult to compete with larger and more well known companies for capital 
our inability to develop our mining properties due to lack of funding  even if warranted  could have a material adverse effect on our operation and financial position 
minerals exploration regulation our uranium mineral exploration and enhancement activities are  and our production activities if and when they occur will be  subject to extensive laws and regulations governing exploration  enhancement  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  protection and remediation of the environment  protection of endangered and protected species  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
uranium minerals exploration is also subject to risks and liabilities associated with pollution of the environment and disposal of waste products occurring as a result of mineral exploration 
compliance with these laws and regulations may impose substantial costs on us and will subject us to significant potential liabilities 
changes could require us to expend significant resources to comply with new laws or regulations and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations 
minerals exploration operations are subject to comprehensive regulation which may cause substantial delays or require capital outlays in excess of those anticipated  causing an adverse effect on our business operations 
minerals exploration operations are subject to federal and state laws relating to the protection of the environment  including laws regulating removal of natural resources from the ground and the discharge of materials into the environment 
minerals exploration operations are also subject to federal and state laws and regulations which seek to maintain health and safety standards by regulating the design and use of drilling methods and equipment 
various permits from government bodies are required for drilling operations to be conducted  no assurance can be given that such permits will be received 
environmental standards imposed by federal and state authorities may be changed and any such changes may have material adverse effects on our activities 
as of the date of this annual report  other than with respect to the posting of a performance bond  we have not been required to spend material amounts on compliance with environmental regulations 
however  we may be required to do so in future and this may affect our ability to expand or maintain our operations 
environmental regulation is discussed in further detail in the following section 
environmental regulation exploration  enhancement and production activities are subject to certain environmental regulations which may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of our operations 
in general  our exploration and production activities are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations relating to environmental quality and pollution control 
such laws and regulations increase the costs of these activities and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuance of a given operation 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our operations or financial condition to date 
specifically  we are subject to legislation regarding emissions into the environment  water discharges  and storage and disposition of hazardous wastes 
in addition  legislation has been enacted which requires facility sites to be abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of state and federal authorities 
waste disposal the resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state statutes  affect minerals exploration and production activities by imposing regulations on the generation  transportation  treatment  storage  disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and on the disposal of non hazardous wastes 
under the auspices of the united states environmental protection agency the epa  the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of rcra  sometimes in conjunction with their own  more stringent requirements 
cercla the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under cercla as hazardous substances hazardous substances 
these classes of persons or potentially responsible parties include the current and certain past owners and operators of a facility or property where there is or has been a release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at such a facility 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some cases  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs of such action 
we may also in the future become an owner of facilities on which hazardous substances have been released by previous owners or operators 
we may in the future be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs to clean up facilities or property at which such substances have been released  and for natural resource damages 
air emissions our operations are subject to state and federal regulations for the control of emissions of air pollution 
major sources of air pollutants are subject to more stringent  federally imposed permitting requirements 
administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air pollution regulations or permits are generally resolved by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies 
alternatively  regulatory agencies could require us to forego construction  modification or operation of certain air emission sources 
clean water act the clean water act cwa imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of wastes  including mineral processing wastes  into waters of the united states  a term broadly defined 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into federal waters 
the cwa provides for civil  criminal and administrative penalties for unauthorized discharges of hazardous substances and other pollutants 
it imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal or remediation associated with discharges of oil or hazardous substances 
state laws governing discharges to water also provide varying civil  criminal and administrative penalties  and impose liabilities in the case of a discharge of petroleum or its derivatives  or other hazardous substances  into state waters 
in addition  the epa has promulgated regulations that require us to obtain permits to discharge storm water runoff 
in the event of an unauthorized discharge of wastes  we may be liable for penalties and costs 
underground injection control uic permits the federal safe drinking water act creates a nationwide regulatory program protecting groundwater 
this act is administered by the epa 
however  to avoid the burden of dual federal and state or indian tribal regulation  the safe drinking water act allows for the uic permits issued by states and indian tribes determined eligible for treatment as states to satisfy the uic permit required under the safe drinking water act under two conditions 
first  the state program must have been granted primacy 
second  the epa must have granted  upon request by the state  an aquifer exemption 
the epa may delay or decline to process the state application if the epa questions the state jurisdiction over the mine site
