item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies allowance for chargebacks and rebates for more information 
the table below presents the percentages of our total gross sales  net revenue and gross trade accounts receivable attributed to each of these three wholesale drug distributors as of and for the years ended december   and gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable gross sales net revenue gross accounts receivable amerisourcebergen cardinal mckesson combined total amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson are key distributors of our products  as well as a broad range of health care products for many other companies 
none of these distributors is an end user of our products 
if sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease  we believe that the end users of our products would likely find little difficulty obtaining our products either directly from us or from another distributor 
however  the loss of one or more of these distributors  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
we consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of them 
a change in purchasing patterns  a decrease in inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors could have a material negative impact on our revenue  business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item a risk factors we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect for more information 
backorders 
as of december   we had approximately million of products on backorder as compared to approximately million of backorders as of december  we anticipate filling all open backorders during government regulation 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive regulation by government agencies  including the fda  the drug enforcement administration dea  the federal trade commission ftc and other federal  state and local agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act the fdc act  the controlled substance act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the development  testing  manufacture  labeling  storage and promotion of products that we manufacture and market 
the fda inspects drug manufacturers and storage facilities to determine compliance with its current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  non compliance with which can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  refusal to approve ndas and andas and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products 
fda approval is required before any application drug product can be manufactured and marketed 
new drugs require the application filing of an nda  including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug 
generic drugs  which are equivalents of existing  off patent brand name drugs  require the application filing of an anda 
an anda does not  for the most part  require clinical studies since safety and efficacy have already been demonstrated by the product originator 
however  the anda must  for example  provide data demonstrating the equivalency of the generic formulation in terms of bioavailability 
the time required by the fda to review and approve ndas and andas is variable and  to a large extent  beyond our control 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and the dea 
throughout the five year period ended december   there have been no product interruptions associated with regulatory inspection or review activities 
the most recent inspections conducted during january february at our somerset  new jersey plant and august at our decatur  illinois plant  resulted in no significant observations 
product recalls 
there were no recalls of any of our products during  or dea regulation 
we also manufacture and distribute several controlled drug substances  the distribution and handling of which are regulated by the dea 
failure to comply with dea regulations can result in fines or seizure of product 
there were no dea citations issued to us in  or environment 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal  state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
foreign sales 
during  and  approximately million  million  and million of our net revenue  respectively  was related to sales to customers in foreign countries 
the sales figure includes million in sales generated by aipl  our subsidiary in india  which exclusively sells product to customers in india and other unregulated world markets 
seasonality and other cyclical sales fluctuations 
most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality 
we do market certain allergy products that typically generate higher sales volume in the warmer months  but these products do not materially impact our overall sales trends 
additionally  we market various antidote products through our hospital drugs injectables segment  the sales of which are largely timed to the expiration of existing stock held by our ongoing customers 
in addition  late in we restarted the distribution of td vaccines  which tends to generate higher sales in spring through fall 
government contracts 
none of our business segments is generally subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the federal government

risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  you should carefully consider each of the risks described below before purchasing shares of our common stock 
the risk factors set forth below are not the only risks that may affect our business 
our business could also be affected by additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could materially suffer 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our growth depends on our ability to timely develop and successfully integrate new pharmaceutical products 
our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted through current marketing and distributions channels and  when appropriate  the enhancement of such marketing and distribution channels 
we may fail to meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing of andas and ndas or may decide not to pursue andas or ndas that we have submitted or anticipate submitting 
our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure 
there can be no assurance that our strategic business alliance partners or we will successfully develop new pharmaceutical products or  if developed  successfully integrate new products into our existing product lines 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary fda approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays  which may adversely  affect the marketing and sale of our products 
our failure to develop new products or to receive fda approval of andas or ndas could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
generic and off patent pharmaceutical products are particularly susceptible to competition  substitution policies and reimbursement policies 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify suitable branded pharmaceutical products to target for development of generic equivalents  determine or anticipate the dates when these branded pharmaceuticals are expected to come off patent  and time our product development activities accordingly so that we will be ready to manufacture and market our generic equivalent products at the most advantageous times 
generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded pharmaceuticals  even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are significantly lower than branded pharmaceuticals 
generic substitution is regulated by the federal and state governments  as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing 
there can be no assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such products will be subject to government reimbursement 
in addition  generic products developed by other third parties may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete  or may glut the market with competing products resulting in a reduction in sale price or market share for the generic products we sell 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market quickly and efficiently in the future 
an increase in competition in the sale of generic pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell 
in addition  governmental and cost containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products 
we attempt to mitigate the effect of this substitution through  among other things  creation of strong brand name recognition and product line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we depend on a small number of distributors  the loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect 
a small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a significant portion of our gross sales  net revenues and accounts receivable 
the following three wholesalers amerisourcebergen  cardinal and mckesson accounted for approximately of total gross sales and of total net revenues in  and of gross trade receivables as of december  in addition to acting as distributors of our products  these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care products on behalf of many other companies 
the loss of our relationship with one or more of these wholesalers  together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users  could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and results of operations 
a change in purchasing patterns or inventory levels  an increase in returns of our products  penalties assessed against us for failure to supply or failure to maintain service levels  delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more of these distributors also could have a material adverse impact on our revenue  results of operations and cash flows 
sales of our products may be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our customer base 
a significant proportion of our sales is made to relatively few retail drug chains  wholesalers  and managed care purchasing organizations 
these customers are continuing to undergo significant consolidation 
such consolidation has provided and may continue to provide them with additional purchasing leverage  and consequently may increase the pricing pressures that we face 
additionally  the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies  and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions  enable those groups to extract price discounts on our products 
our net sales and quarterly growth comparisons may also be affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of retail chains  major distributors and other trade buyers  whether resulting from seasonality  pricing  wholesaler buying decisions or other factors 
in addition  since such a significant portion of our revenues is derived from relatively few customers  any financial difficulties experienced by a single customer  or any delay in receiving payments from a single customer  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to extensive government regulations that increase our costs and could subject us to fines  prevent us from selling our products or prevent us from operating our facilities 
federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business 
the development  testing  manufacturing  processing  quality  safety  efficacy  packaging  labeling  record keeping  distribution  storage and advertising of our products  and disposal of waste products arising from such activities  are subject to regulation by the fda  dea  ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the occupational safety and health administration and the environmental protection agency 
similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities 
noncompliance with applicable united states and or state or local regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
new  modified and additional regulations  statutes or legal interpretation  if any  could  among other things  require changes to manufacturing methods  expanded or different labeling  recall  replacement or discontinuation of certain products  additional record keeping procedures and expanded documentation of the properties of certain products and additional scientific substantiation 
such changes or new legislation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to regulation by the fda 
all pharmaceutical manufacturers  including us  are subject to regulation by the fda under the authority of the fdc act 
under the fdc act  the federal government has extensive administrative and judicial enforcement authority over the activities of finished drug product manufacturers to ensure compliance with fda regulations 
this authority includes  but is not limited to  the authority to initiate judicial action to seize unapproved or non complying products  to enjoin non complying activities  to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance with cgmp  to recall products  to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute violators 
other enforcement activities include refusal to approve product applications  withdrawal of previously approved applications or prohibition on marketing of certain grandfathered products 
any such enforcement activities  especially the restriction or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the fda or other government agencies having regulatory authority over pharmaceutical products may request us to voluntarily or involuntarily conduct product recalls due to disputed labeling claims  manufacturing issues  quality defects or for other reasons 
restriction or prohibition on sales  halting of manufacturing operations  recalls of our pharmaceutical products or other enforcement actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  such actions  in certain circumstances  may constitute an event of default under the terms of our various financing arrangements 
we must obtain approval from the fda for each pharmaceutical product that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy  and approval is never certain 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies or impose other post marketing obligations  which could have a material adverse effect on marketability and profitability of the new products 
we and our third party manufacturers are subject to periodic inspection by the fda to assure regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing  distribution  and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
the fda imposes stringent mandatory requirements on the manufacture and distribution of pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy 
the fda also regulates drug labeling and the advertising of prescription drugs 
a finding by a governmental agency or court that we are not in compliance with fda requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the fda changes its regulatory position  it could force us to delay or suspend our manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain products 
fda interpretations of existing or pending regulations and standards may change over time with the advancement of associated technologies  industry trends  and or prevailing scientific rationale 
if the fda changes its regulatory position due to such factors  it could result in delay or suspension of the manufacturing  distribution or sales of certain of our products 
in addition  modifications or enhancements of approved products are in many circumstances subject to additional fda approvals which may or may not be granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process 
any change in the fda s enforcement policy or any decision by the fda to require an approved nda or anda for one of our products not currently subject to the approved nda or anda requirements or any delay in the fda approving an nda or anda for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive dea regulation  which could result in our being fined or otherwise penalized 
we also manufacture and sell drugs which are controlled substances as defined in the federal controlled substances act and similar state laws  which impose  among other things  certain licensing  security and record keeping requirements administered by the dea and similar state agencies  as well as quotas for the manufacture  purchase and sale of controlled substances 
the dea could limit or reduce the amount of controlled substances which we are permitted to manufacture and market or issue fines and penalties against us for purported non compliance with dea regulations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recently enacted and future healthcare law and policy changes may adversely affect our business 
in march  the us congress enacted the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act 
this health care reform legislation is intended to broaden access to health insurance  reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending  enhance remedies against fraud and abuse  add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries  impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms 
as examples  the current legislation include measures that would i significantly increase medicaid rebates through both the expansion of the program and significant increases in rebates  ii substantially expand the public health system b program to allow other entities to purchase prescription drugs at substantial discounts  iii extend the medicaid rebate rate to a significant portion of managed medicaid enrollees  iv assess a rebate on medicaid part d spending in the coverage gap for branded and authorized generic prescription drugs  and v levy a significant excise tax on the industry to fund the healthcare reform 
while the aforementioned healthcare reform legislation may increase the number of patients who have insurance coverage for our products  such insurance mandate does not commence until january  and the healthcare reform legislation also restructures payments to medicare managed care plans and reduces reimbursements to many third party payers 
accordingly  the timing on the insurance mandate  the change in the medicaid rebate levels  the additional fees imposed on us to the extent we market branded drugs  other compliance obligations  and the reduced reimbursement levels to institutional customers may result in a loss of revenue and could adversely affect our business 
while we will not know the full effects of this health care reform legislation until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law and the new law has been fully implemented  it appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing  especially under the medicare program  and to increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs 
the sales of our products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  health maintenance organizations including pharmacy benefit managers pbms and other health care related organizations 
we expect both federal and state governments in the us and foreign governments to continue to propose and pass new legislation  rules and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare while expanding individual healthcare benefits 
existing regulations that affect the price of pharmaceutical and other medical products may also change before any of our products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any product we develop in the future 
in addition  pbms and other third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved pharmaceutical products 
our products may not be considered cost effective  or adequate third party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize a return on our investments 
all of these may harm our ability to market our products and generate profits 
our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully utilize our existing cash reserves and operating cash flows to complete strategic acquisitions or to identify  acquire or develop  new products to market and distribute 
we continue to seek growth opportunities  either by completing strategic acquisitions or by developing and introducing new pharmaceutical products 
continued improvement in our financial performance is dependent on our ability to introduce new products on an ongoing basis  whether developed internally or by third party partners  or acquired from other companies 
any delays or an inability to successfully identify suitable acquisition targets  or acquire or develop  and market and distribute new products  or acquisition or development of new products that do not yield sufficient margins  may result in adverse financial consequences to our business 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from our acquisitions and may face difficulties in integrating them  which could adversely affect our operating results  increase costs and place a significant strain on our management 
if we fail to manage the integration of our domestic and international acquisitions and achieve expected synergies  our business could be disrupted and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
the operating success of both our domestic and international acquisitions involves the integration of products  processes and personnel into our existing model 
in addition  the integration of international acquisitions requires both establishing and training a local management team and overseeing the operations remotely  and can involve cultural  monetary and systems challenges 
our personnel  systems  procedures  or controls may not be adequate to support both our ongoing business and the acquired businesses 
if our newly acquired businesses require a disproportionate share of our resources and management s attention  our overall financial results may suffer 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that may not result in marketable products 
we have entered into several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with low cost finished dosage form products 
we have entered into various purchase and supply agreements and license agreements that are all designed to provide finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will result in additional fda approved andas or ndas  or that we will be able to market any such additional products at a profit 
in addition  any clinical trial expenses that we may incur in connection with these strategic business alliances may negatively impact our financial results 
failure to obtain regulatory certification of our manufacturing plant in india for production of pharmaceutical products for export to the united states  as well as other regulated world markets  could impair our ability to grow and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we operate a manufacturing campus in paonta sahib  india  which we acquired through a business combination in the manufacturing units within this campus were built to the standards of regulated markets  including the united states  but they are not currently approved by the fda to manufacture products for export to the united states 
it is our intention to obtain certification from the fda and other regulatory authorities to allow this facility to manufacture products for export to the united states and other regulated world markets 
obtaining such certification in a timely manner is critical to our sustaining our growth 
an inability to obtain or maintain such certification could restrict our ability to achieve our growth objectives  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our operations in india may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in india  including changes in exchange rates and controls  interest rates and taxation policies  any reversal of india s recent economic liberalization and deregulation policies  as well as social stability and political  economic or diplomatic developments affecting india in the future 
in addition  india is known to have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in some circumstances  anti bribery laws may conflict with some local customs and practices 
as a result of our policy to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa and similar anti bribery laws  we may be at a competitive disadvantage to competitors that are not subject to  or do not comply with  such laws 
we may not generate cash flow sufficient to pay interest on our outstanding convertible senior notes or repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes 
the notes require us to make semi annual coupon interest payments of million on june and december of each year until the notes mature on june  if we do not generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund these payments or obtain additional funding from external sources at acceptable terms  we may not have sufficient funds to satisfy our interest payment obligations when those obligations are due which would place us in default under the indenture as defined below 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase their notes 
if we fail to repurchase the notes when required  we will be in default under the indenture 
availability under our credit agreement may be restricted if we fail to meet our covenant requirements 
we are party to a revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na  the agent and other financial institutions collectively with the agent  the boa lenders through which we obtained a million revolving line of credit the boa credit facility  which includes a million letter of credit facility 
we may request expansion of the boa credit facility from time to time in increments of at least million up to a maximum commitment of million  so long as no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
as of december   no amounts or letters of credit were outstanding under the boa credit facility 
availability under the boa credit facility is equal to the lesser of a million reduced by outstanding letter of credit obligations or b the amount of a borrowing base as defined in the boa credit agreement determined by reference to the value of the borrowers eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory and fixed assets as of the closing date and the end of each calendar month thereafter 
the boa credit agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  limitations on distributions  additional borrowings  liens and guarantees  additional investments and asset sales  and fundamental changes to corporate structure or organization documents 
the financial covenants require the borrowers to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to during any period commencing on the date that an event of default occurs or availability under the boa credit agreement is less than of the aggregate boa lenders commitments under the boa credit agreement 
in addition  we must periodically provide to the agent financial statements  compliance certificates and budget projections 
should we fail to maintain compliance with these covenants  availability under the credit agreement could be restricted which would negatively impact our liquidity and may require us to seek additional sources of capital in order to maintain our continuing operations or to fund growth opportunities 
we may need to obtain additional capital to continue to grow our business 
we may require additional funds in order to materially grow our business 
we require substantial liquidity to implement long term cost savings and productivity improvement plans  continue capital spending to improve our manufacturing plants to increase capacity and support product development programs  meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities  and run our normal business operations 
we may seek additional funds through public and private financing  including equity and debt offerings 
however  adequate funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available to us when needed or on favorable terms 
without sufficient additional capital funding  we may be required to delay  scale back or abandon some or all of our product development  manufacturing  acquisition  licensing and marketing initiatives  or operations 
further  such additional financing  if obtained  may require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders and could include covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest 
our industry is very competitive 
additionally  changes in technology could render our products obsolete 
we face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies  including major pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours  in developing  acquiring  manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
the selling prices of pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases 
further  other products now in use  under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies  may be more effective or offered at lower prices than our current or future products 
the industry is characterized by rapid technological change that may render our products obsolete  and competitors may develop their products more rapidly than we can 
competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process sooner  and therefore  may begin to market their products in advance of ours 
we believe that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price  service and technical capabilities 
there can be no assurance that i we will be able to develop or acquire commercially attractive pharmaceutical products  ii additional competitors will not enter the market  iii our existing products will not be rendered obsolete by the introduction or switch to generic of competing products  or iv competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unstable market and economic conditions may have serious adverse consequences on our business 
our general business strategy may be adversely affected by general economic conditions  a volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions 
if equity and credit market conditions prove unfavorable  we may have difficulty obtaining desired debt or equity financing  or obtaining such financing may be more difficult  more costly  and more dilutive 
a prolonged or profound economic downturn could result in adverse changes to product reimbursement  pricing or sales levels  which would harm our operating results 
there is a risk that one or more of our current service providers  manufacturers and other partners may not survive difficult economic times  which would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget 
failure to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy  financial performance and stock price and could require us to delay or abandon development plans 
moreover  our stock price may decline due to the volatility of the stock market and general economic conditions 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results  timely file our periodic reports  maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud 
in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of and for the year ended december   we concluded there is a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to deficiencies in the financial statement close process 
under standards established by the public company oversight board  a material weakness is a deficiency  or combination of deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting  such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected or corrected on a timely basis 
we are working to remediate the material weakness 
we have begun taking steps and plan to take additional measures to remediate the underlying causes of the material weakness  primarily through the continued development and implementation of formal policies  improved processes and documented procedures  as well as the hiring of additional finance personnel 
the actions that we are taking are subject to ongoing senior management review  as well as audit committee oversight 
although we plan to complete this remediation as quickly as possible  we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take  and our initiatives may not prove to be successful in remediating this material weakness 
if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weakness  or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future  our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results 
our management or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify other material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future 
the existence of internal control material weaknesses may result in current and potential stockholders losing confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business  the market price of our common stock  and our ability to retain our current  or obtain new  alliance and collaboration agreements partners 
in addition  the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may affect our ability to timely file periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
the inability to timely file periodic reports could result in the sec revoking the registration of our common stock  which would prohibit us from listing or having our stock quoted on any public market 
this would have an adverse effect on our business and stock price by limiting the publicly available information regarding us and greatly reducing the ability of our stockholders to sell or trade our common stock 
we may become involved in legal proceedings from time to time which may result in losses  damage to our business and reputation and place a strain on our internal resources 
in the ordinary course of our business  we may be involved in legal proceedings with both private parties and certain government agencies  including fda 
litigation may result in verdicts against us  which may include significant monetary awards  judgments that certain of our intellectual property rights are invalid or unenforceable and injunctions preventing the manufacture  marketing and sale of our products 
if disputes are resolved unfavorably  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
any litigation  whether or not successful  may damage our reputation 
furthermore  we are likely to incur substantial expense in defending these lawsuits and the time demands of such lawsuits could divert management s attention from ongoing business concerns and interfere with our normal operations 
in the normal course of business  we periodically enter into employment agreements  legal settlements  and other agreements which incorporate indemnification provisions 
we maintain insurance coverage which we believe will effectively mitigate our obligations under these indemnification provisions 
however  should our obligation under an indemnification provision exceed our coverage or should coverage be denied  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent or delay us from manufacturing and selling some of our new products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products frequently sue companies that file applications to produce generic equivalents of their patented brand products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which may delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expire or are held to be not infringed  invalid  or unenforceable 
when we or our development partners submit an anda to the fda for approval of a generic drug  we and or our development partners must certify either that there is no patent listed by the fda as covering the relevant brand product  that any patent listed as covering the brand product has expired  that the patent listed as covering the brand product will expire prior to the marketing of the generic product  in which case the anda will not be finally approved by the fda until the expiration of such patent  or that any patent listed as covering the brand drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the generic product for which the anda is submitted 
under any circumstance in which an act of infringement is alleged to occur  there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue us for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
also  competing pharmaceutical companies may file lawsuits against us or our strategic partners alleging patent infringement or may file declaratory judgment actions of non infringement  invalidity  or unenforceability against us relating to our own patents 
we have been sued for patent infringement related to several of our current anda filings and we anticipate that we will be sued once we file andas for other products in our pipeline 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
our patents and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and processes 
the patent and proprietary rights position of competitors in the pharmaceutical industry generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and is the subject of much litigation 
there can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary rights  including licensed rights  relating to our potential products or processes will result in patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured  or that the resulting patents or proprietary rights  if any  will provide protection against competitors who i successfully challenge our patents or proprietary rights  ii obtain patents or proprietary rights that may have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business  or iii are able to circumvent our patent or proprietary rights position 
it is possible that other parties have conducted or are conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that would precede any discoveries made by us  which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed therefrom 
consequently  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to or rendering obsolete those that we are planning to develop  or duplicate any of our products 
our inability to obtain patents for  or other proprietary rights in  our products and processes or the ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  virtually all the drug products that we market are generics  with essentially no patent or proprietary rights attached 
while this fact allowed us the opportunity to develop or to purchase and obtain fda approval to market our generic products  it also allows competing drug companies to do the same 
should multiple additional drug companies choose to develop and market the same generic products that we actively market  our profit margins could decline  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the chairman of our board of directors is subject to conflicts of interest  and through his stock ownership and position as chairman has substantial influence over our business strategies and policies 
john n 
kapoor  phd  the chairman of our board of directors and a principal shareholder  is the president of ej financial enterprises  inc ej financial  a health care consulting investment company 
ej financial is involved in the management of health care companies in various fields  and dr 
kapoor is involved in various capacities with the management and operation of these companies 
the john n 
kapoor trust dated the kapoor trust  the beneficiary and sole trustee of which is dr 
kapoor  is a principal shareholder of each of these companies 
as a result  dr 
kapoor does not devote his full time to our business 
although such companies do not currently compete directly with us  certain companies with which ej financial is involved are in the pharmaceutical business 
discoveries made by one or more of these companies could render our products less competitive or obsolete 
potential conflicts of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   dr 
kapoor beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  dr 
kapoor can strongly influence  and potentially control  the outcome of our corporate actions  including the election of our directors and transactions involving a change of control 
this concentrated control limits other shareholders ability to influence corporate matters and  as a result  the company may take actions that other shareholders do not view as beneficial 
further  decisions made by dr 
kapoor with respect to his and his related parties ownership or trading of our common stock could have an adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on key executive officers and must continue to attract and retain key personnel in order to compete successfully 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain key executive officers 
the loss of one or more of our key executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
further  our performance depends  to a large extent  on the continued service of our key research and development personnel  other technical employees  managers and sales personnel and our ability to continue to attract and retain such personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical personnel 
we are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for such personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled personnel in the future  and the inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  and on our results of operations and financial condition 
we may implement product recalls and could be exposed to significant product liability claims  we may have to pay significant amounts to those harmed and may suffer from adverse publicity as a result 
the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products  or items within our products  may prove to be defective and cause a health risk 
in that event  we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority 
we have recalled products in the past and  based on this experience  believe that the occurrence of a recall could result in significant costs to us  potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our customers and adverse publicity  all of which could harm our ability to market our products 
for example  we were prompted to initiate one product recall of our cyanide antidote kit during due to recall notification by becton  dickinson and company of their ml syringe 
our recall of the cyanide antidote kit was monitored by fda and has resulted in no patient impact and no shortage of product supply to the marketplace 
there were no product recalls during  or although we are not currently subject to any material product liability proceedings  we may incur material liabilities relating to product liability claims in the future 
even meritless claims could subject us to adverse publicity  hinder us from securing insurance coverage in the future and require us to incur significant legal fees and divert the attention of the key employees from running our business 
successful product liability claims brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have product liability insurance in the amount of  for aggregate annual claims with a  deductible per incident and a  aggregate annual deductible 
however  there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential claims 
additionally  there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available in the future at acceptable costs  if at all  or that a product liability claim would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fda may require us to stop marketing certain grandfathered drugs 
we market several generic prescription products which do not have formal fda approvals because these products have been grandfathered 
these products are non application drugs that are manufactured and marketed without fda issued andas or ndas on the basis of their having been marketed by industry prior to the amendment of the fdc act 
we marketed eight such products during  generating net sales revenue of million 
following enactment of the fdc act in  drugs on the market prior to that time were exempted or grandfathered and manufacturers were not required to file an nda 
recently  fda has increased its efforts to force companies to file and seek fda approval for grandfathered products 
efforts have included issuing notices to companies currently manufacturing these products to cease its distribution of said products 
on october   we received a warning letter from fda citing that we were manufacturing pilocarpine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution phos  a long grandfathered drug  without an approved nda 
we fully cooperated with the fda and discontinued selling phos 
no enforcement action was initiated and no fines were assessed by fda against us and the loss of revenue associated with the discontinuation of phos is expected to be insignificant 
further  in the second quarter of  we filed an anda for phos  which has been granted expedited review 
if fda issues additional warning letters with respect one or more of our grandfathered products  we may be forced to discontinue marketing the affected products  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
the fda may authorize sales of some prescription pharmaceuticals on a non prescription basis  which would reduce the profitability of our prescription products 
from time to time  the fda elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a prescription basis  without a prescription 
fda approval of the sale of our products without a prescription would reduce demand for our competing prescription products and  accordingly  reduce our profits 
our revenues depend on sale of products manufactured by third parties  which we cannot control 
we rely on external third parties to manufacture certain of the products we sell 
currently  this risk is limited to several of our products 
however  we expect this risk to become more significant as we receive approvals for new products to be manufactured through our strategic partnerships and as we seek additional growth opportunities beyond the capacity and capabilities of our current manufacturing facilities 
if we are unable to obtain or retain third party manufacturers for these products on commercially acceptable terms  we may not be able to distribute such products as planned 
further  no assurance can be given that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of our products to meet our needs or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications 
any delays or difficulties with third party manufacturers could adversely affect the marketing and distribution of certain of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source 
we require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted 
many of the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific products and cause our sales and profitability to decline 
further  in the case of many of our andas and ndas  only one supplier of raw materials has been identified 
because fda approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials in their applications  fda approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier 
the qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts 
if for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components required to produce and package our products  we may not be able to manufacture our products as planned  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we could experience business interruptions at our manufacturing facilities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
we manufacture drug products at one international and two domestic manufacturing facilities 
any one or more of these facilities may be forced to shut down or may be unable to operate at full capacity as a result of hurricanes  tornadoes  earthquakes  storms and other extreme weather events as well as strikes  war  violent upheavals  terrorist acts and other force majeure events 
for example  our manufacturing plant in somerset  new jersey was shut down for approximately two weeks in october november as a result of power outages and related business disruptions caused by superstorm sandy 
a significant disruption at any of these facilities  even on a short term basis  could impair our ability to produce and ship drug products to the market on a timely basis  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
the testing required for the regulatory approval of our products is conducted by independent third parties 
any failure by any of these third parties to perform this testing properly and in a timely manner may have an adverse effect upon our ability to obtain regulatory approvals 
our applications for the regulatory approval of our products incorporate the results of testing and other information that is conducted or gathered by independent third parties including  for example  manufacturers of raw materials  testing laboratories  contract research organizations or independent research facilities 
our ability to obtain regulatory approval of the products being tested is dependent upon the quality of the work performed by these third parties  the quality of the third parties facilities  and the accuracy of the information provided by third parties 
we have little or no control over any of these factors 
if this testing is not performed properly  our ability to obtain regulatory approvals could be restricted or delayed 
we may be subject to disruptions or failures in our information technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business 
we also hold data in various data center facilities upon which our business depends 
a disruption  infiltration or failure of our information technology systems or any of our data centers as a result of software or hardware malfunctions  system implementations or upgrades  computer viruses  third party security breaches  employee error  theft or misuse  malfeasance  power disruptions  natural disasters or accidents could cause breaches of data security  loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation of sensitive competitive information 
any of these events could result in the loss of key information  impair our production and supply chain processes  harm our competitive position  cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we have implemented a number of protective measures  such measures may not be adequate or implemented properly to prevent or fully address the adverse effect of such events 
failure to comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act could subject us to  among other things  penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our us operations are currently subject to the fcpa 
we are required to comply with the fcpa  which generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other benefits 
in addition  the fcpa imposes accounting standards and requirements on publicly traded us corporations and their foreign affiliates  which are intended to prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments  and to prevent the establishment of off books slush funds from which such improper payments can be made 
if our employees  third party sales representatives or other agents are found to have engaged in such practices  we could suffer severe penalties  including criminal and civil penalties  disgorgement and other remedial measures  including further changes or enhancements to our procedures  policies and controls  as well as potential personnel changes and disciplinary actions 
any failure to comply with the complex reporting and payment obligations under medicare  medicaid and other government programs may result in litigation or sanctions 
we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse  including anti kickback  false claims  marketing and pricing laws 
we are also subject to medicaid and other government reporting and payment obligations that are highly complex and somewhat ambiguous 
violations of these laws and reporting obligations are punishable by criminal and or civil sanctions and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid 
the recent healthcare reform legislation made several changes to the federal anti kickback statute  false claims laws  and health care fraud statute such as increasing penalties and making it easier for the government to bring sanctions against pharmaceutical companies 
if our past  present or future operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or other similar governmental regulations  we may be subject to the applicable penalty associated with the violation which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and negatively impact our financial results 
further  if there is a change in laws  regulations or administrative or judicial interpretations  we may have to change our business practices or our existing business practices could be challenged as unlawful  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract management 
as a public company  we are subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act and the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act 
these requirements are extensive 
the exchange act requires that we file annual  quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition 
the sarbanes oxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight is required 
this may divert management s attention from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
exercise of warrants and options  or issuance of shares pursuant to our convertible debt  may have a substantial dilutive effect on our common stock 
if the price per share of our common stock at the time of exercise or conversion of any warrants or stock options is in excess of the various exercise or conversion prices of such convertible securities  exercise or conversion of such convertible securities would have a dilutive effect on our common stock 
as of december   holders of our outstanding warrants and options would receive  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
any additional financing that we secure likely will require the granting of rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock which may result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
our earnings per share will be diluted if the average closing price of our common stock exceeds the conversion price currently per share on our convertible notes 
in addition  the notes become convertible if the closing trading price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for of the last trading days of any calendar quarter through the remaining term of the notes 
if the notes become convertible and are surrendered for conversion  we have the option of satisfying all or a portion of our obligation in shares of our common stock  which could result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of our common shareholders 
we may issue preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock may reduce the market value of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to a total of  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
our board of directors may authorize issuance of additional shares of preferred stock and the terms of such preferred stock without further action by holders of our common stock 
if we issue additional shares of preferred stock  it could affect the rights or reduce the market value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we continue to seek capital for the growth of our business  and this additional capital may be raised through the issuance of additional preferred stock 
we experience significant quarterly fluctuation of our results of operations  which may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  the timing of the development and marketing of new pharmaceutical products  the failure to develop such products  delays in obtaining government approvals  including fda approval of ndas or andas for our products  expenditures to comply with governmental requirements for manufacturing facilities  expenditures incurred to acquire and promote pharmaceutical products  changes in our customer base  a customer s termination of a substantial account  the availability and cost of raw materials  interruptions in supply by third party manufacturers  seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in the sales of certain of our products  the introduction of new products or technological innovations by our competitors  loss of key personnel  changes in the mix of products sold by us  changes in sales and marketing expenditures  competitive pricing pressures  expenditures incurred to pursue or contest pending or threatened legal action and our ability to meet our financial covenants 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in avoiding losses in any future period 
such fluctuations may result in volatility in the price of our common stock 
further  concentrated ownership of our common stock creates a risk of sudden changes in our share price 
as such  the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we manufacture and market a full line of diagnostic and therapeutic ophthalmic pharmaceuticals as well as niche hospital drugs and injectable pharmaceuticals 
we manufacture and or offer products in various specialty areas  including ophthalmology  antidotes  anti infectives  controlled substances for pain management and anesthesia  and vaccines  among others 
we also manufacture and market a line of over the counter dry eye and eye health products under the brand name theratears 
we have three identified operating segments active segments ophthalmic sales of diagnostic and therapeutic ophthalmic drugs and over the counter eye care products hospital drugs injectables sales of diagnostic and therapeutic injectables and other hospital drugs  as well as biologics and vaccines contract services sales of various drugs that we manufacture for others to be sold under their own brand names revenue the year was marked by continued growth in revenue and profitability  as we continued to execute on our strategic objectives 
revenue grew to million in compared to million in  and we generated operating income of million compared to million in the prior year 
this growth was the result of new product launches  the re launch of dormant products and acquisitions 
new product development during  we continued the expansion of our r d efforts and began to reap the benefits of prior fda filings by receiving a number of anda approvals 
among our product approvals in were vancomycin hydrochloride capsules and progesterone capsules 
r d expenses increased from million in to million in  and we are in the process of relocating our r d center to a new  larger facility to support future growth 
re launch of dormant products during  we re launched a number of dormant products in response to market shortages and or changes in their overall market 
during  we sought to establish an ongoing market presence for these products  as well as filling any market shortage needs 
new products and re launched products launched since the start of combined to account for of our sales growth in over the prior year 
acquisitions on february   we completed the acquisition of the business assets and principal manufacturing plant of kilitch drugs india limited which operated a pharmaceutical manufacturing plant in paonta sahib  india 
this facility currently manufactures drugs for contract customers in india and for export to unregulated worldwide markets 
our goal is for this facility to gain fda approval for the manufacture of various drugs for distribution to the united states  which will supplement our existing manufacturing capacity and provide opportunity for expansion of our product menu as well as provide additional capabilities 
the kilitch acquisition followed our acquisition of three branded  injectable drugs from lundbeck in december and our acquisition of avr  the makers of the theratears line of over the counter eye care products  in may business combinations and product acquisitions combined to account for of our sales growth in over the prior year 
results of operations for the years  and  we have identified and reported operating results for three distinct business segments ophthalmic  hospital drugs injectables  and contract services 
our reported results by segment are based upon various internal financial reports that disaggregate certain operating information 
our chief operating decision maker  as defined in accounting standards codification asc topic  segment reporting  is our ceo 
our ceo oversees operational assessments and resource allocations based upon the results of our reportable segments  all of which have available discrete financial information 
in prior years  we had reported a fourth segment  biologics vaccines  which consisted of our sale of td vaccine and various influenza vaccines manufactured by others and marketed by us 
we ceased the distribution of vaccines in early  and restarted their distribution at the end of due to the non material nature of vaccine sales in and  and the similarities in customers and distribution methods to our hospital drugs injectables segment  we have included sales of biologics and vaccines in our hospital drugs injectables segment for all years presented below 
the following table sets forth amounts and percentages of total revenue for certain items from our consolidated statements of operations and our segment reporting information for the years ended december   and dollar amounts in thousands amount of revenue amount of revenue amount of revenue revenues hospital drugs injectables ophthalmic contract services total revenues gross profit and gross margin percentage hospital drugs injectables ophthalmic contract services total gross profit operating expenses selling  general administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization write down of intangibles acquisition related costs operating income net income comparison of twelve months ended december  and our revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase in revenue was related to a number of factors  including acquisitions  sales of new and revived products and increased sales of existing products 
of the million increase in revenues  million was related to business combinations and product acquisitions completed since the start of  million was from a combination of newly approved products and re launched products in response to more favorable market conditions  and million was related to sales volume increases for continuing products  partially offset by a million reduction attributable to price changes on continuing products 
in terms of reportable segments  revenues from our hospital drugs injectables segment were million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was principally attributable to sales of products acquired through the lundbeck acquisition  and sales of newly approved and revived products 
ophthalmic segment revenues were million  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
the three main factors contributing to this increase were sales from new and revived products  a full year s revenue from the avr acquisition  and sales increases from existing ophthalmic products 
contract services revenue was million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year 
this increase was related to the million revenue generated from the kilitch acquisition  partially offset by a decline in us contract business of million due to a shift in manufacturing toward akorn products

chargeback and rebate expense for was million  or of gross revenue  compared to million  or of gross revenue  in the million increase in chargeback and rebate expense was due to higher gross sales volume in the slight decrease in chargeback and rebate expense as a percentage of gross sales was attributable to increases in sales outside the wholesale channel 
our products returns provision in was million  or of gross sales  compared to million  or of gross sales  in the slight decrease in percentage was due to favorable historical product return trends and a higher percentage of sales of non returnable products 
our consolidated gross profit for was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in this gross profit increase of million  or  was principally due to our revenue growth from acquisitions  new product introductions and product revivals 
the slight decrease in overall profit margin was due to lower margin business  such as the contract revenue of akorn india  which offset higher margin business  such as the sales of products acquired through the lundbeck acquisition 
the gross profit margin on ophthalmic segment sales was in compared to in  this decline being primarily attributable to increased sales of over the counter ophthalmic products by our subsidiary  avr  which was acquired in may the gross profit margin on hospital drugs injectables increased to in from in primarily due to the higher gross margin on the lundbeck products 
the gross profit margin on contract services decreased to in from in primarily due to lower margin business from our indian subsidiary 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  over the prior year sg a expenses of million

amortization of deferred financing costs totaled million in compared to million in the expense was related to amortizing the financing costs on our notes and our boa credit facility 
the expense included a million write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs to our ej credit facility  which we elected to early terminate in june our expense also included million in amortization of deferred financing costs related to our notes 
in  we recorded non cash interest expense of million compared to million in the prior year 
our non cash interest expense was related to the debt discount on our notes and to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration payable related to the acquisition of lundbeck products 
interest expense was million in compared to million in our interest expense in each year was principally related to the notes  which were issued effective june  we are a partner in the joint venture company  which we account for using the equity method 
during  we recorded million of equity in income from this unconsolidated joint venture  of which million was related to our share of the gain from the joint venture company s sale of its andas to pfizer on december   and the remaining million was from the joint venture company s operations 
the joint venture company ceased operations in and no income was recorded in in  we recorded a non operating expense of million related to an option agreement we entered into to protect ourselves from a negative movement in the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and indian rupees 
we entered into this option agreement in october following our entry into an agreement to buy certain assets from kilitch in india  as the purchase price for the kilitch acquisition was established in indian rupees 
we incurred no similar expense in comparison of twelve months ended december  and our revenues were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to this increase in revenue was related to a number of factors  including the acquisition of avr  increased sales of existing products through sales efforts and share gains from market shortages  introduction of new products  and price increases for certain products 
of the million increase in revenues  million was related to new products and the re launch of dormant products to capitalize on market opportunities  million was due to increased sales of existing products  million was related to selected price increases  and million was related to acquisitions  partially offset by a decline of million related to our strategic decision to cease the distribution of biologics vaccines effective march as it relates to our reportable segments  the increase in revenue for our ophthalmic segment was primarily due to the acquisition of avr and sales volume increases for our existing products 
the increase in revenue in our hospital drugs injectables segment was primarily due to re launches and new products  along with volume increases for existing products 
the decline in contract segment revenues was due to refocusing our manufacturing plants on producing akorn branded products  along with the loss of avr as a contract customer upon our acquisition of this business in may the market shortages are related to a number of factors  including cgmp issues experienced by various competing drug companies and competitors strategic decisions to cease manufacturing various products 
we monitor market conditions and attempt to respond to market opportunities  such as those provided by market shortages 
however  it is difficult to predict the duration and severity of market shortage for most drugs  and our revenues and gross profit margins may fluctuate accordingly 
our revenues of million was net of adjustments totaling million for chargebacks  rebates  administration fees  returns  discounts and allowances  and coupons and advertising 
chargeback and rebate expense for was million or of gross revenue  compared to expense of million  or of gross revenue 
the million increase in chargeback expense was due to higher gross sales volume in as a percentage of gross sales  the decrease in chargeback and rebate expenses is attributable to the avr business  which is subject to minimal chargebacks 
our products returns provision was million in compared to million in this million increase was due to higher sales volume in our consolidated gross profit for was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in this gross profit increase of million  or  was due to several factors  including revenue growth from our introduction of new products carrying higher profit margins  increased sales and selected price increases for existing products  improved plant utilization  and improved inventory management 
the gross profit margin on ophthalmic segment sales increased to in compared to in  and the gross profit margin on hospital drugs injectables increased to in compared to in the prior year 
these increases were primarily due to improved utilization of our manufacturing facilities  as well as a number of lesser factors  such as selected price increases for certain products 
the gross profit margin on contract services increased to in compared to in the prior year  this increase being primarily attributable to improved plant utilization  price increases for certain products  and the elimination of lower margin contract revenue from avr upon our acquisition of that business 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  from the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to sg a expenses for avr  increases in wages and salaries for additional headcount to support our growth  and increases in non cash stock compensation expense and management bonuses in accordance with our improved financial performance 
research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in this increase of million was the result of our commitment to enhancing our internal r d infrastructure  increased r d activity at our dedicated facility in skokie  illinois  and the establishment of a million reserve against inventory of products pending fda approval 
amortization of intangibles consists of the amortization of nda and anda drug acquisition costs over the anticipated market lives of the acquired products  as well as the amortization of other intangible assets acquired through business combinations

write off and amortization of deferred financing costs totaled million in compared to million in in each year  the majority of the expense was related to write offs 
in june  we elected to early terminate our ej credit facility and wrote off million in remaining unamortized deferred financing costs 
in december  we early paid the balance due under our subordinated note  writing off million of unamortized deferred financing costs and million of early payment fee 
in  we also recorded million in amortization of deferred financing costs related to our notes 
in  we recorded non cash interest expense of million related to the debt discount of our notes 
we incurred no similar expense in interest expense was million in compared to million in the prior year 
this increase was related to our notes  which were issued effective june  interest expense related to the notes was million and was partially offset by interest earned on the proceeds from the offering 
the lower interest expense in was related primarily to our subordinated note with ej funds 
we are a partner in the joint venture company  which we account for using the equity method 
during  we recorded million of equity in income from this unconsolidated joint venture  compared to million in the prior year 
of the million income in  million was related to our share of the gain from the joint venture company s sale of its andas to pfizer on december   and the remaining million was from the joint venture company s operations 
of the million income in  million was related to our share of the gain 
the joint venture company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the rights to all of its andas to pfizer for million in cash 
the asset purchase agreement contained two closing dates  with some andas having been transferred on the initial close date of december  and the rest transferred on the final closing date of may  the gains from this sale were allocated between the two closing dates based on the relative fair value of the andas transferred to pfizer on each date 
the joint venture company essentially ceased operations in the second quarter of during  we incurred non cash expenses of million related to the change in fair value of warrants we granted at various dates in to companies controlled by our chairman  dr 
john kapoor the kapoor warrants 
we classified the kapoor warrants as current liabilities from their grant dates until june   and adjusted their book values quarterly to reflect changes in their fair values 
as a result of an amendment entered into on june  to the registration rights agreement associated with these warrants  we reclassified the kapoor warrants from current liabilities to a component of shareholders equity on june  and made no subsequent fair value adjustments beyond that date 
accordingly  there was no similar expense recorded in in  we recorded a non operating expense of million related to an option agreement we entered into to protect ourselves from a negative movement in the foreign exchange rate between us dollars and indian rupees 
we entered into this option agreement in october following our entry into an agreement to buy certain assets from kilitch in india  as the purchase price for the kilitch acquisition was established in indian rupees 
we incurred no similar expenses in financial condition and liquidity cash flow as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which is million lower than our cash and cash equivalents balance of million as of december  this decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the million we used to complete the kilitch acquisition on february  and million used to acquire property  plant and equipment  partially offset by million in positive cash flow from operations 
our net working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease of million was primarily attributable to the decline in our cash and cash equivalents balance  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventory  which grew in step with our overall business growth during for the year  we generated million in cash flow from operations 
this positive operating cash flow was primarily the result of our net income of million and non cash expenses of million  partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and a million increase in inventory 
in the prior year of  we generated million in positive cash flow from operations 
this positive operating cash flow was primarily due to the combination of million of net income and million of non cash expenses  partially offset by million equity in earnings of the joint venture company and a combined increase of million in accounts receivable and inventory 
in  we used million cash in investing activities 
of this total  million was used to complete the kilitch acquisition in february and million was used to acquire property  plant and equipment  principally as part of the expansion project at our somerset  new jersey manufacturing plant 
in the prior year  we used million in investing activities  of which million was used for business and product acquisitions  million was used to purchase property  plant and equipment  and million was used to make an equity method investment in aciex  offset by million generated from distributions from the joint venture company 
financing activities generated million in cash during  all of which was related to stock option exercises and participation in the employee stock purchase plan 
during  we generated million in cash through financing activities  with the most significant source being the net million generated through our million offering of convertible senior notes due  partially offset by million in financing fees related to the notes and the boa credit facility 
additional financing cash flow of million was generated from pipe warrant exercises in the first quarter of  while stock option exercises and participation in the employee stock purchase plan generated a combined million during the year 
we believe that our cash reserves  operating cash flows and availability under our boa credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
liquidity and capital needs we require certain capital resources in order to maintain and expand our business 
specifically  we anticipate investing in the range of million in capital projects during  which includes approximately million to continue the expansion and upgrade of our manufacturing facility in paonta sahib  india 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our cash reserves  operating cash flows and availability under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to grow and expand our business through the acquisition of new businesses  manufacturing facilities  or pharmaceutical product rights 
such acquisitions may require us to obtain additional sources of capital 
we cannot predict the amount of capital that may be required to complete such acquisitions  and there is no assurance that sufficient financing for these activities would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all

subordinated note payable on july   we borrowed million from the kapoor trust dated september   the sole trustee and sole beneficiary of which is dr 
john n 
kapoor  the chairman of our board of directors and the holder of a significant stock position in the company  in return for issuing the trust a subordinated note the subordinated note

increases in fair value  or decreases in fair value to  but not below  their initial calculated fair values  were recorded as non operating expenses or income in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the applicable periods 
we classified the fair value of the kapoor warrants as a current liability in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging  formerly eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
this is a result of a requirement in the registration rights agreement entered into among the kapoor trust  ej funds and us on august  that the shares to be issued upon exercise of the warrants be registered shares  which cannot be absolutely assured 
on june   we entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement the amended agreement with dr 
kapoor which modified certain terms related to our obligation to obtain and maintain registration of any shares issued pursuant to exercise of the kapoor warrants 
the amended agreement still requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to file a registration statement pursuant to rule of the securities act of registration statement for any shares of common stock that may be issued under the applicable warrant agreements  and to maintain the continuous effectiveness of such registration statement until the earliest of i the date no shares of the our common stock qualify as registrable securities  ii the date on which all of the registrable securities may be sold in a single transaction by the holder to the public pursuant to rule or a similar rule  or iii the date upon which the john n

the amended agreement further provides that the term commercially reasonable efforts in such instance shall not mean an absolute obligation of ours to obtain and maintain registration 
on june   upon entering into the amended agreement  we completed a final black scholes calculation of the fair value of the kapoor warrants and adjusted their book value accordingly  then reclassified the kapoor warrants from a current liability to a component of shareholders equity 
after reclassifying the kapoor warrants to shareholders equity  no subsequent fair value adjustments were required 
the increases in fair value of the kapoor warrants were recorded as expenses under the caption change in fair value of warrants liability in our consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december  and we recorded expense of million during related to the increase in fair value of the kapoor warrants 
the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the warrants at june  and december  were as follows june  december  expected volatility expected life in years risk free interest rate dividend yield the following table provides summarized information about the kapoor warrants fair values s granted to warrant identification grant date warrants granted exercise price at grant dates as of as of ej funds modification warrants apr  kapoor trust reimbursement warrants apr  ej funds credit facility warrants aug  kapoor trust subordinated note warrants aug  footnotes the modification warrants were granted to ej funds on april  when we signed the modification agreement with ej funds related to modifications made to our credit agreement following its assignment from ge capital to ej funds on march  those modifications included resetting the maximum loan commitment to million and setting the interest rate at a fixed per annum  among others 
the reimbursement warrants were granted to the kapoor trust on april  when we entered into a reimbursement and warrant agreement the reimbursement agreement with ej funds and the kapoor trust pursuant to which the kapoor trust agreed to provide the l c as security for our payment obligations to mbl under the mbl letter agreement and the mbl settlement agreement

the warrants were exercisable for a five year period ended march  at an exercise price of per share and may be exercised by cash payment of the exercise price or by means of a cashless exercise 
holders submitted  warrants for cashless exercise during  leaving  remaining outstanding as of december  subsequently  during the period from january  through march   holders submitted  of the warrants for exercise 
the remaining  warrants expired unexercised on march  contractual obligations in order to support the continued increase in the number of relevant and marketable pharmaceutical products that we market and sell  we will from time to time partner with outside firms for the development of selected products 
these development agreements frequently call for the payment of milestone payments as various steps in the process are completed in relation to product development and submission to the fda for approval 
the dollar amount of these payments is generally fixed contractually  assuming that the required milestones are achieved 
however  the timing of such payments is contingent based on a variety of factors and is therefore subject to change 
the amounts disclosed in the below table under the caption strategic partners contingent payments represents our best estimate of the amount and expected timing of the milestone payments and other fees we expect to pay to outside development partners based on our current contractual agreements with them 
these milestone payments are accrued as liabilities on the our balance sheets once the milestones have been achieved 
on december   we entered into the lundbeck agreement through which we acquired the nda rights to three branded  off patent drugs 
in addition to an initial cash payment of million  the lundbeck agreement committed us to paying additional consideration of million in cash on the third anniversary of the agreement date  assuming that subsequent sales of the applicable products achieved certain targets 
we believe that there is a strong likelihood that these targets will be reached and that the additional consideration will be paid when due 
this liability has been recorded on our books at the initial discounted value of million  which considers both the time value of money and the slight possibility that less than the full amount will ultimately become due 
at december  the liability was million 
as more fully described under item properties  we lease the facilities that we occupy in gurnee  lake forest  skokie and vernon hills  illinois  ann arbor  michigan  and in somerset  new jersey 
we also lease various pieces of office equipment at these facilities  as well as at our manufacturing plant in decatur  illinois 
our remaining obligations under these leases are summarized in the table below 
as of december   our principal financial obligation was related to our notes 
we had no balance outstanding under our boa credit agreement at december  or any time since we entered into this agreement on october  the following table details our future contractual obligations as of december  in thousands description total and beyond convertible senior notes due interest payable convertible notes contingent consideration acquisitions inventory purchase commitments leases strategic partners contingent payments total note the strategic partner payments are estimates which assume that various contingencies and market opportunities occur in and beyond off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to our shareholders 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize product sales for our ophthalmic and hospital drugs injectables business segments upon the shipment of goods or upon the delivery of goods  depending on the sales terms 
the contract services segment  which produces products for third party customers based upon their specification at a pre determined price  also recognizes sales upon the shipment of goods or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate 
revenue is recognized when all of our obligations have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is probable 
provision for estimated doubtful accounts  chargebacks  rebates  discounts and product returns is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted  if necessary  at each balance sheet date 
allowance for chargebacks and rebates we enter into contractual agreements with certain third parties such as hospitals and gpos to sell certain products at predetermined prices 
the parties have elected to have these contracts administered through wholesalers that buy the product from us and subsequently sell it to those third parties 
when a wholesaler sells products to one of the third parties that are subject to a contractual price agreement  the difference between the price paid to us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the wholesaler 
we track sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each wholesaler 
utilizing this information  we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product 
we reduce gross sales and increase the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback amount for each product sold to a wholesaler 
we reduce the chargeback allowance when we process a request for a chargeback from a wholesaler 
actual chargebacks processed can vary materially from period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers 
however  our provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
we obtain certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness of the chargeback allowance that will be paid out in the future 
we assess the reasonableness of our chargeback allowance by applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to the quantities of inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of in transit inventory that is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the period 
in accordance with our accounting policy  our estimate of the percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement is based on a six quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers 
we use this percentage estimate until historical trends or new information indicates that a revision should be made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our actual chargeback rate experience and new trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
the historical percentages that we have used during  and are as follows period start date period end date estimated of wholesaler inventory that will be subject to contractual price agreements july  june  july  june  july  september  october  current we will continue to use the estimate in future periods until trends indicate that a revision should be made 
similarly  we maintain an allowance for rebates related to fee for service contracts and other programs with certain customers 
rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each eligible customer 
we track sales by product number for each eligible customer and then apply the applicable rebate percentage  using both historical trends and actual experience to estimate our rebate allowance 
we reduce gross sales and increase the rebate allowance by the estimated rebate amount when we sell our products to our rebate eligible customers 
we reduce the rebate allowance when we process a customer request for a rebate 
at each balance sheet date  we analyze the allowance for rebates against actual rebates processed and make necessary adjustments as appropriate 
actual rebates processed can vary materially from period to period 
however  our provision for rebates is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized 
the recorded allowances reflect our current estimate of the future chargeback and rebate liability to be paid or credited to our wholesaler and other customers under the various contracts and programs 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded chargeback and rebate expense of million  million and million  respectively 
the allowances for chargebacks and rebates were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the current year increase within our allowance for chargebacks and rebates was primarily due to the increases in overall sales volume in compared to allowance for product returns certain of our products are sold with the customer having the right to return the product within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons  including but not limited to pending expiration dates 
provisions are made at the time of sale based upon tracked historical experience  by customer in some cases 
we estimate our required product returns reserve based on historical percentage of returns to sales by product  considering actual returns processed to date  the expected impact of product recalls and current wholesaler inventory levels of our products to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in future product returns 
we also consider one time historical return events or pending new developments that would impact the expected level of future returns 
for new products  we assess the market dynamics for that product and consider our past returns experience for similar products in our portfolio 
our sales returns level can be impacted by factors such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for substitute products which can increase or decrease the end user pull through for sales of our products and ultimately impact the level of sales returns 
actual returns experience and trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change 
actual returns processed can vary materially from period to period 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a net provision for product returns of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in returns provision from to was in line with the increase in revenue from year to year 
the increase from million in to million in was at a pace lower than our increase in sales  largely due to adjustments to our required reserve level based on evaluation of historical product returns trends 
as of december  and  our allowances for product returns were million and million  respectively 
allowance for coupons and promotions we issue coupons from time to time redeemable against our theratears eye care products 
upon release of coupons into the market  we record an estimate of the dollar value of coupons we expect to be redeemed 
this estimate is based on historical experience and is adjusted as needed based on actual redemptions 
in addition to couponing  from time to time we authorize various retailers to run in store promotional sales of our products 
upon confirmation that a promotion was run  we accrue an estimate of the dollar amount we expect to owe back to the retailer 
this estimate is trued up upon receipt of invoice from the retailer 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded provisions for coupons and promotions totaling million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  the balance in our reserve for coupons and promotions was million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions for doubtful accounts  which reflect trade receivable balances owed to us that are believed to be uncollectible  are recorded as a component of sg a expenses 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our historical experience with collections and write offs  the credit quality of our customers and any recent or anticipated changes thereto  and the outstanding balances and past due amounts from our customers 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded net provisions for doubtful accounts of   and  respectively 
the recovery of  recorded in was related the recovery of accounts previously thought to be uncollectible 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had a total of million of past due gross accounts receivable  of which million was more than days past due 
on a monthly basis  we perform a detailed analysis of the receivables due from our wholesaler customers and provide a specific reserve against known uncollectible items for each of the wholesaler customers 
we also include in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount that we estimate to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due receivables 
the percentage we reserve increases as the age of the receivables increases 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost average cost method or market 
we maintain an allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value nrv 
for finished goods inventory  we estimate the amount of inventory that may not be sold prior to its expiration or is slow moving based upon recent sales activity by unit and wholesaler inventory information 
we also analyze our raw material and component inventory for slow moving items 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded a provision for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales of million  million  and million  respectively 
the allowance for inventory obsolescence nrv was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when  based on management judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints or impediments to approval 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the product timeline for approval 
business combinations business combinations are accounted for under asc  business combinations  using the acquisition method of accounting 
the acquisition method of accounting requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date measured at their fair values as of that date 
fair value determinations are based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques 
in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a material acquisition  we may utilize appraisals from third party valuation firms to determine fair values of some or all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  or may complete some or all of the valuations internally 
in either case  we take full responsibility for the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the value of goodwill will be determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration conveyed to the seller over the fair value of the net assets received 
under the acquisition method of accounting  we will identify the acquirer and the closing date and apply applicable recognition principles and conditions 
acquisition related costs are costs incurred by us to effect a business combination 
we account for acquisition related costs as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received 
warranty liability the product warranty liability primarily relates to a ten year expiration guarantee on dtpa products sold to hhs in we are performing yearly stability studies for this product and  if the annual stability does not support the ten year product life  we will replace the product at no charge 
our supplier  hameln pharmaceuticals  will also share one half of this cost if the product does not meet the stability requirement 
if the ongoing product testing confirms the ten year stability for the dtpa products we will not incur a replacement cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales after the ten year period 
income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the tax and book basis assets and liabilities  as well as net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that will likely be in effect when the book to tax differences are expected to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
intangibles our intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill  trademarks and customer relationships acquired through business acquisitions and product licensing rights obtained through our acquisition of andas and ndas from other pharmaceutical companies 
goodwill is deemed to be an indefinite lived asset and is not amortized 
our other intangible assets are deemed to be finite lived and are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
we regularly test all of our intangibles for impairment based on several factors  including estimated fair values and anticipated future cash flows from each asset 
we recorded amortization expense of million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  in relation to our intangibles 
accumulated amortization was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that impairment may exist 
we use widely accepted valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our reporting units used in our annual goodwill impairment analysis 
our valuation is primarily based on qualitative and quantitative assessments regarding the fair value of goodwill relative to its carrying value 
we modeled the fair value of the reporting unit based on actual projected earnings and cash flows of the reporting unit 
we performed our annual impairment test on october  and determined that the fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and  therefore  no impairment charge was necessary 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and this cost is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes model for estimating the grant date fair value of the stock options we grant 
determining the assumptions that enter into the model is subjective and requires a certain amount of judgment 
we use an expected volatility that is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life assumption is based on historical employee exercise patterns and employee post vesting terminations experience 
the risk free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on us treasury securities in effect during the quarter in which the options were granted 
the dividend yield has historically been set at zero  reflecting the fact that we have not historically issued dividends and do not anticipate issuing dividends in the foreseeable future 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates in subsequent periods  when necessary  if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates
