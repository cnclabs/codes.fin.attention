index management s discussion and analysis is presented in the following order overview business segments revenue and expenses results of operations liquidity and capital resources material off balance sheet arrangements critical accounting policies overview merge healthcare develops software solutions that facilitate the sharing of images to create a more effective and efficient electronic healthcare experience for patients and physicians 
our solutions are designed to help solve some of the most difficult challenges in health information exchange today  such as the incorporation of medical images and diagnostic information into broader healthcare it applications  the interoperability of proprietary software solutions  and the ability to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our customers businesses 
our ability to innovate has driven consistent expansion of solutions and services and entry into new markets 
our solutions optimize processes for healthcare providers ranging in size from single provider practices to large health systems  to the sponsors of clinical trials and medical device manufacturers 
these solutions are licensed by more than  hospitals   clinics and labs  medical device manufacturers and by top pharmaceutical companies world wide 
we believe that we have an opportunity to grow revenue by expanding our solution footprint with existing customers  as only a small percent currently have more than one of our enterprise solutions 
business segments effective in the second quarter of  we have reportable and operating groups which we have designated merge healthcare and merge dna 
we evaluate the performance of each operating group based on their respective revenues and operating income  which excludes certain corporate costs  interest expense  amortization of issuance and note discount costs and income taxes 
merge primarily generates revenue from the sale of software including upgrades  hardware  professional services  maintenance and electronic data interchange edi services 
today  the majority of total revenue is merge primarily generates revenue from the sale of software including upgrades  hardware  professional generated through perpetual license agreements with our customers 
merge dna derives the vast majority of its revenue from software  professional services  and hosting through subscription arrangements 
under perpetual license agreements  the software  hardware and professional services are considered to be sources of non recurring revenue and related backlog 
the backlog of non recurring revenue was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we also generate revenue through subscription based pricing arrangements in which the contract elements are payable by our customers over a number of years 
generally  these contracts will include a minimum image volume and or dollar commitment 
as such  revenue from these transactions is recognized ratably over an extended period of time 
subscription arrangements include  but are not limited to  contracts structured with monthly payments including leases and long term clinical trials 
due to the length of sales cycles with our customers  merge would expect these types of arrangements to become more prevalent in and beyond 
in the second half of  subscription revenue was approximately of total net sales and subscription revenue backlog as of december  was million

revenues and expenses the following is a brief discussion of our revenues and expenses net sales net sales consist of software and other sales  net of estimated returns and allowances  including software and purchased component revenue recognized in sales to oem customers  healthcare facilities and other providers  professional services  including hosting  installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting and project management  and maintenance and edi  including software maintenance and support 

index cost of sales cost of sales consists of software and other cost of sales  including purchased components and third party royalties included in software and hardware sales to our customers  professional services cost of sales  including headcount and related costs incurred in our performance of saas offerings  installation  custom engineering services  training  consulting and project management  maintenance and edi cost of sales  including headcount and related costs and direct third party costs incurred to fulfill our maintenance and support obligations and to deliver edi services  and depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  for amounts assessed on capital equipment used to fulfill contract obligations as well as our purchased and developed software and backlog assets 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective assets useful lives 
each quarter we test our purchased and developed software for impairment by comparing its net realizable value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its net realizable value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense includes the costs of our sales and marketing departments  commissions and costs associated with trade shows 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred for the development of our proprietary software and technologies 
the amortization of capitalized software development costs and any related impairments are included in cost of sales

depreciation  amortization and impairment depreciation and amortization  including any impairment  are assessed on capital equipment  leasehold improvements and our customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreement intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization are recorded over the respective assets useful lives 
we also record impairment of these long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support recovery of the assets 
other income expense other income expense is comprised of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalent balances  interest expense  amortization of costs and discounts incurred from borrowings and issuance costs on borrowings which did not qualify for capitalization 
it also includes foreign exchange gains or losses on foreign currency payables and receivables 
in addition  we also record any other than temporary impairment charges recognized on our equity investments in non public companies in other income expense 

index results of operations the following have significantly impacted the results of operations for the periods discussed herein during the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges of million related to third party licenses and technology considered unusable  million for the write off of acquired intangibles and million related primarily to uncollectible billings from customer contracts obtained through acquisitions in the past few years 
in  we expanded our product offerings through the acquisition of amicas  inc amicas which we acquired on april  as a result of the timing of the completion of the acquisition  the comparability of the results of operations for the year ended december  differ significantly from the year ended december  we completed restructuring initiatives in september to reduce our workforce  in august concurrent with the acquisition of ois  and in april concurrent with the acquisition of amicas these initiatives assisted in providing operational rigor to a combined  larger organization and enabled us to decrease costs as a percentage of revenue most notably general and administrative costs 
we issued million of notes in april as part of the financing for the acquisition of amicas 
the notes were issued at of the principal amount  are due in and bear interest at of principal payable on may st and november st of each year 
in connection with the notes  we incurred issuance costs of million 
the years ended december  and include twelve months and eight months  respectively  of interest expense and amortization of the original issuance discount and costs of the notes 
we issued additional notes in june to redeem and retire our series a preferred stock which had been issued as part of the financing for the acquisition of amicas 
we issued these additional million of notes at of the principal amount with terms identical to the notes issued in april we used these proceeds to retire all  outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock at the face value of million and paid cumulative dividends of million which were accruing at a annual compounded rate 
the year ended december  includes seven months of interest expense and amortization of the premium and certain issuance costs  whereas the year ended december  includes no such expenses 
also  in the year ended december  we incurred million in costs related to the issuance of the additional notes  including million which was expensed in other expense  net of our statement of operations and million which was capitalized and is being amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the notes

as of december   approximately million of our cash balance was held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we may need to accrue and pay taxes if we choose to repatriate these funds 
general we believe our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our operating  financing and capital requirements through at least the next months  including interest payments due under the notes 
however  any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in the event that it is necessary to raise additional capital to meet our short term or long term liquidity needs  such capital may be raised through additional debt  equity offerings or sale of certain assets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity  equity related or debt securities  such securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
furthermore  the number of shares of any new equity or equity related securities that may be issued may result in significant dilution to existing shareholders 
in addition  the issuance of debt securities could increase the liquidity risk or perceived liquidity risk that we face 
we cannot  however  be certain that additional financing  or funds from asset sales  will be available on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we will likely not be able to take advantage of opportunities  develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures 
any projections of future cash inflows and outflows are subject to uncertainty 
in particular  our uses of cash in and beyond will depend on a variety of factors such as the costs to implement our business strategy  the amount of cash that we are required to devote to defend and address any regulatory proceedings  and potential merger and acquisition activities 

index from time to time we evaluate our alternatives for the redemption or refinancing of the notes at or prior to their maturity in no assurance can be given as to the terms or timing of any such transaction 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates  judgments  and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
we base our estimates and judgments on our experience  our current knowledge including terms of existing contracts  our beliefs of what could occur in the future  our observation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following accounting policies and estimates as those that we believe are most critical to our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  intangible assets and goodwill  share based compensation expense  income taxes  guarantees and loss contingencies 
revenue recognition revenues are derived primarily from the licensing of software  sales of hardware and related ancillary products  saas offerings  installation and engineering services  training  consulting  and software maintenance and edi 
inherent to software revenue recognition are significant management estimates and judgments in the interpretation and practical application of the complex rules to individual contracts 
these interpretations generally would not influence the amount of revenue recognized  but could influence the timing of such revenues 
in addition  revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
significant areas of judgment include the determination of deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement and treatment as separate units of accounting  whether separate arrangements with the same customer executed within a short time frame of each other are a single arrangement  the assessment of the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer since we generally do not request collateral from customers  the determination of whether the fees are fixed and determinable  whether or not installation  engineering or consulting services are significant to the software licensed  and the amount of total estimated labor hours  based on management s best estimate  to complete a project we account for under the input method of percentage of completion accounting 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated labor hours  and reflect changes in estimates in the period that such estimates are revised under the cumulative catch up method 
typically  our contracts contain multiple elements  and while the majority of our contracts contain standard terms and conditions  there are instances where our contracts contain non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine the estimated selling price of each element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
as a result  if facts and circumstances change that affect our current judgments  our revenue could be materially different in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns based upon past experience and judgment  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts related to our accounts receivable and customer credits with respect to our sales returns 
we determine collection risk and record allowances for bad debts based on the aging of accounts and past transaction history with customers 
in addition  our policy is to allow sales returns when we have preauthorized the return 
we have determined an allowance for estimated returns and credits based on our historical experience of returns and customer credits 
we monitor our collections  write offs  returns and credit experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our receivables or modifications to our credit standards  collection  return and credit  authorization practices or other related policies may impact our estimates 

index intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets include purchased software  capitalized software  customer relationships  backlog  trade names  and non compete agreements 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed  which is primarily the straight line method 
purchased software and capitalized software are tested for impairment quarterly by comparing the net realizable value estimated using undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the software 
if the carrying value of the software exceeds its net realizable value  we record an impairment charge in the period in which the impairment is incurred equal to the amount of the difference between the carrying value and estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
customer relationships  backlog  trade names and non compete agreements are evaluated for potential impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  based primarily upon whether expected future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to support the asset s recovery 
if the actual useful life of the asset is shorter than the useful life estimated by us  the asset may be deemed to be impaired  and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset determined by a discounted cash flow analysis  or a shorter amortization period  may be required 
we have reviewed these long lived assets with estimable useful lives and determined that their carrying values as of december  are recoverable in future periods 
we review goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
no triggering events or impairment indicators were noted during our policy provides that goodwill will be reviewed for impairment as of october st of each year 
in calculating potential impairment losses  we evaluate the fair value of goodwill using either quoted market prices or  if not available  by estimating the expected present value of their future cash flows 
identification of  and assignment of assets and liabilities to  a reporting unit require our judgment and estimates 
in addition  future cash flows are based upon our assumptions about future sales activity and market acceptance of our products 
if these assumptions change  we may be required to write down the gross value of our remaining goodwill to a revised amount 
we performed our goodwill testing and determined that there is no impairment as of december   since the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying value 
share based compensation expense we calculate share based compensation expense for option awards based on the estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  and recognize the expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of stock based awards is based on certain assumptions  including expected volatility  which we base on the historical volatility of our stock and other factors  and estimated option life  which represents the period of time the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based  in part  on historical data 
we also estimate employee terminations option forfeiture rate  which is based  in part  on historical data  employee class and the type of award 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options and restricted stock awards on a quarterly basis 
the estimation of share based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
although we believe our assumptions used to calculate share based compensation expense are reasonable  these assumptions can involve complex judgments about future events  which are open to interpretation and inherent uncertainty 
in addition  significant changes to our assumptions could significantly impact the amount of expense recorded in a given period 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
a current liability is recorded for the estimated taxes payable for the current year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the timing differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates or tax laws are recognized in the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 

index valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized 
changes in valuation allowances will flow through the statement of operations unless related to deferred tax assets that expire unutilized or are modified through translation  in which case both the deferred tax asset and related valuation allowance are similarly adjusted 
where a valuation allowance was established through purchase accounting for acquired deferred tax assets  any future change will be credited or charged to income tax expense 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in spite of our belief that we have appropriate support for all the positions taken on our tax returns  we acknowledge that certain positions may be successfully challenged by the taxing authorities 
we determine the tax benefits more likely than not to be recognized with respect to uncertain tax positions 
unrecognized tax benefits are evaluated quarterly and adjusted based upon new information  resolution with taxing authorities and expiration of the statute of limitations 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes in the liability for our uncertain tax positions 
although we believe our recorded tax assets and liabilities are reasonable  tax laws and regulations are subject to interpretation and inherent uncertainty  therefore  our assessments can involve both a series of complex judgments about future events and rely on estimates and assumptions 
although we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination could be materially different than that which is reflected in our provision for income taxes and recorded tax assets and liabilities 
guarantees we recognize the importance of identifying the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by us  as applicable 
in addition  we must continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the guarantees and indemnifications in order to identify if a loss has occurred 
if we determine it is probable that a loss has occurred  then any such estimable loss would be recognized under those guarantees and indemnifications 
under our standard software license agreements  we agree to indemnify  defend and hold harmless our licensees from and against certain losses  damages and costs arising from claims alleging the licensees use of our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
historically  we have not been required to pay material amounts in connection with claims asserted under these provisions  and  accordingly  we have not recorded a liability relating to such provisions 
we also represent and warrant to licensees that our software products will operate substantially in accordance with published specifications  and that the services we perform will be undertaken by qualified personnel in a professional manner conforming to generally accepted industry standards and practices 
historically  only minimal costs have been incurred relating to the satisfaction of product warranty claims 
other guarantees include promises to indemnify  defend and hold harmless each of our executive officers  non employee directors and certain key employees from and against losses  damages and costs incurred by each such individual in administrative  legal or investigative proceedings arising from alleged wrongdoing by the individual while acting in good faith within the scope of his or her job duties on our behalf 
loss contingencies we have accrued for costs as of december  and may  in the future  accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents included money market funds and short term deposits  including certain cash that is restricted  totaling approximately million  and earned interest at a weighted average rate of in the value of the principal amounts is equal to the fair value for these instruments 
due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio  our interest income is subject to changes in short term interest rates 
at current investment levels  our pre tax results of operations would vary by approximately million for every basis point change in our weighted average short term interest rate 
we do not use our portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange risk we have sales and expenses in canada  china  and europe that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and  as a result  have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases to levels that we do not deem acceptable  we may choose to hedge those exposures
