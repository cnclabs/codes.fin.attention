we have long standing relationships with many of the leading manufacturers in the markets we serve  including paccar inc  daimler trucks north america  chrysler group  llc  volvo ab  komatsu  navistar international corporation  aggreko plc  ford motor company and man nutzfahrzeuge ag 
we serve our customers through a network of approximately company owned and independent distributor locations and approximately  dealer locations in more than countries and territories 
our reportable operating segments consist of the following engine  components  power generation and distribution 
this reporting structure is organized according to the products and markets each segment serves and allows management to focus its efforts on providing enhanced service to a wide range of customers 
the engine segment produces engines and parts for sale to customers in on highway and various industrial markets 
our engines are used in trucks of all sizes  buses and recreational vehicles  as well as in various industrial applications  including construction  mining  agriculture  marine  oil and gas  rail and military equipment 
the components segment sells filtration products  aftertreatment  turbochargers and fuel systems 
the power generation segment is an integrated provider of power systems which sells engines  generator sets and alternators 
the distribution segment includes wholly owned and partially owned distributorships engaged in wholesaling engines  generator sets and service parts  as well as performing service and repair activities on our products and maintaining relationships with various oems throughout the world 
our financial performance depends  in large part  on varying conditions in the markets we serve  particularly the on highway  construction and general industrial markets 
demand in these markets tends to fluctuate in response to overall economic conditions 
our sales may also be impacted by oem inventory levels and production schedules and stoppages 
economic downturns in markets we serve 
table of contents generally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products 
as a worldwide business  our operations are also affected by currency  political  economic and regulatory matters  including adoption and enforcement of environmental and emission standards  in the countries we serve 
as part of our growth strategy  we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of these risks such as china  brazil  india  mexico  russia and countries in the middle east and africa 
at the same time  our geographic diversity and broad product and service offerings have helped limit the impact from a drop in demand in any one industry or customer or the economy of any single country on our consolidated results 
the global economy continued to slow throughout  although the impacts were partially offset by strong demand across several end markets in the us and canada north america in the first half of the year  however these markets weakened in the second half of the year  particularly the heavy duty truck market 
economies in emerging markets  including china and brazil experienced challenges throughout the year in most markets  especially the off highway construction market in china and the medium duty truck market in brazil 
demand in india remained strong for power generation equipment  however  improved volumes were more than offset by unfavorable currency impacts 
international excludes the us and canada off highway construction markets have continued to deteriorate with engine shipments down percent  including a percent decline in china 
the on highway medium duty truck market in brazil declined as the result of the pre buy ahead of the new emission requirements and one of our customers replacing our b engine with a proprietary engine in contributing to international medium duty truck shipments being down percent 
north american demand for heavy duty on highway products increased percent while medium duty truck shipments increased percent in compared to  although demand in both of these markets declined in the second half of north american light duty on highway demand also improved with an increase in shipments to chrysler of percent in compared to slow growth in the us economy and uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues caused businesses to hold back on capital expenditures in  thus impacting demand for truck and power generation equipment 
the governments of china and india have controlled inflation through tight monetary policies in the form of rising interest rates and tightening access to credit  although both countries began easing these policies in response to reduced inflationary concerns in brazil also began easing their monetary policies in the second half of easing monetary policies could enhance our end markets  however  there likely will be a delay between when these policies are implemented and when our end markets respond 
the european economy remains uncertain with continued volatility in the euro countries 
although we do not have any significant direct exposure to european sovereign debt  we generated approximately percent of our net sales from euro zone countries in as a result of a number of markets unexpectedly slowing in mid  continued weak economic data in a number of regions and increasing levels of uncertainty regarding the direction of the global economy  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives in the second half of in october  we announced strategic actions necessary to respond to the current environment by cutting costs while maintaining investments in key growth programs 
actions include a number of measures to reduce costs including planned work week reductions  shutdowns at some manufacturing facilities and some targeted workforce reductions

demand in some of our markets is expected to improve in the second half of following a slower start in the first half of the year 
the new heavy duty supply agreement with navistar international corporation is expected to have a positive impact on our heavy duty truck engine and component sales 
we currently expect the following challenges to our business that may reduce our earnings potential in political decisions in the us regarding federal tax and budget issues could continue to create economic uncertainty that may limit capital investments and negatively impact the overall north american economy in the first half of we expect most of our markets to be weak in the first quarter of but should begin to improve in the second quarter  although remaining below levels in the first half of demand in certain european markets could continue to decline due to economic uncertainty 
growth in international markets could be negatively impacted if emission regulations are not strictly enforced 
demand for our products in certain industrial markets in china could remain low due to high equipment inventory levels 

table of contents currency volatility could continue to put pressure on earnings 
north american oil and gas markets could continue to remain weak 
domestic and international mining markets could continue to deteriorate if commodity prices weaken 
long term we believe that  over the longer term  there will be economic improvements in most of our current markets and that our opportunities for long term profitable growth will continue in the future as the result of the following four macroeconomic trends that will benefit our businesses tightening emissions controls across the world  infrastructure needs in emerging markets  energy availability and cost issues and globalization of industries like ours

the gains and losses have been excluded from segment results as they were not considered in our evaluation of operating results for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources management assessment of liquidity our financial condition and liquidity remain strong 
our solid balance sheet and credit ratings enable us to have ready access to credit 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate adequate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
we generate significant ongoing cash flow  which has been used  in part  to fund capital expenditures  pay dividends on our common stock  fund repurchases of common stock and make acquisitions 
cash provided by operations is our principal source of liquidity 
as of december   other sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of billion  of which approximately percent was located in the us and percent was located primarily in the uk  china  singapore  india and brazil  marketable securities of million  which were located primarily in india and brazil and the majority of which could be liquidated into cash within a few days  revolving credit facility with billion available  net of outstanding letters of credit and international and other domestic short term credit facilities with million available 
we believe our liquidity provides us with the financial flexibility needed to fund working capital  capital expenditures  projected pension obligations  dividend payments  common stock repurchases  acquisitions  restructuring actions and debt service obligations 

table of contents our new revolving credit agreement  completed in the fourth quarter of  provides us with a billion unsecured revolving credit facility  the proceeds of which are to be used for our general corporate purposes 
see note  debt to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
the credit agreement includes one financial covenant a leverage ratio 
the required leverage ratio  which measures the sum of total debt plus securitization financing to consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda for the four fiscal quarters may not exceed to at december   our leverage ratio was to a significant portion of our cash flows is generated outside the us as of december   the total of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was billion  the vast majority of which was located in the uk  china  india  singapore and brazil 
the geographic location of our cash and marketable securities aligns well with our business growth strategy 
we manage our worldwide cash requirements considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed 
as a result  we do not anticipate any local liquidity restrictions to preclude us from funding our targeted expansion or operating needs with local resources 
if we distribute our foreign cash balances to the us or to other foreign subsidiaries  we could be required to accrue and pay us taxes 
for example  we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes if we repatriated cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings we have asserted are permanently reinvested outside of the us foreign earnings for which we assert permanent reinvestment outside the us consist primarily of earnings of our us domiciled subsidiaries 
at present  we do not foresee a need to repatriate any earnings from these subsidiaries for which we have asserted permanent reinvestment 
however  to help fund cash needs of the us or other international subsidiaries as they arise  we repatriate available cash from certain foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are not permanently reinvested when it is cost effective to do so 
our and subsequent earnings from our china operations are considered permanently reinvested  while earnings generated prior to  for which us deferred tax liabilities have been recorded  are expected to be repatriated in future years 
we continuously monitor our pension assets and believe that we have limited exposure to the european debt crisis 
no sovereign debt instruments of crisis countries are held in the trusts  while any equities are held with large well diversified multinational firms or are de minimis amounts in large index funds 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
the maturity schedule of our existing long term debt does not require significant cash outflows in the intermediate term 
required annual principal payments range from million to million over each of the next five years 
working capital summary we fund our working capital with cash from operations and short term borrowings when necessary

see note  income taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
our other commercial commitments as of december   are as follows other commercial commitments after total in millions standby letters of credit under revolving credit agreement international and other domestic letters of credit performance and excise bonds guarantees  indemnifications and other commitments total application of critical accounting estimates a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements which discusses accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap which often requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts presented and disclosed in the financial statements 
management reviews these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience  changes in business conditions and other relevant factors they believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in any given reporting period  our actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting estimates are defined as follows the estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the estimate was made  different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and the change would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of our accounting policies  related accounting estimates and the disclosures set forth below with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe our critical accounting estimates include those addressing the estimation of liabilities for warranty programs  recoverability of investment related to new products  accounting for income taxes and pension benefits 
warranty programs we estimate and record a liability for base warranty programs at the time our products are sold 
our estimates are based on historical experience and reflect management best estimates of expected costs at the time products are sold and subsequent adjustment to those expected costs when actual costs differ 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the nature and frequency of product recall programs  the liability for such programs is recorded when we commit to a recall action or when a recall becomes probable and estimable  which generally occurs when it is announced 
our warranty liability is generally affected by component failure rates  repair costs and the point of failure within the product life cycle 
future events and circumstances related to these factors could materially change our estimates and require adjustments to our liability 
new product launches require a greater use of judgment in developing estimates until historical experience becomes available 
product specific experience is typically available four or five quarters after product launch  with a clear experience trend evident eight quarters after launch 
we generally record warranty expense for new products upon shipment using a preceding product warranty history and a multiplicative factor based upon preceding similar product experience and new product assessment until sufficient new product data is available for warranty estimation 
we then use a blend of actual new product experience and preceding product historical experience for several subsequent quarters  and new product specific experience thereafter 
note  product warranty liability  to our consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the activity in our warranty liability account for and including adjustments to pre existing warranties 
recoverability of investment related to new products at december   we have capitalized million associated with the future launch of our new light duty diesel engine product 
development of this product began in market uncertainty related to the global recession that began in resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs 
at december   we reviewed our investment of million for possible impairment 
we used projections to assess whether future cash flows on an undiscounted basis related to the assets are likely to exceed the related carrying amount to determine if a write down was appropriate 
these projections required estimates about product volume and the size of the market for vehicles that are not yet developed 
we used input from our customers in developing alternative cash flow scenarios 
our analysis indicated that the assets were recoverable 
customers that are expected to purchase sufficient quantities to recover our investment in the new light duty diesel engine products remained active with the development of this product through  and there were no significant changes to the assumptions used in if customer expectations or projected volumes deteriorate and we do not identify alternative customers and or product applications  we could be required to write down these assets to net realizable value 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we determine our income tax expense using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
future tax benefits of tax loss and credit carryforwards are also recognized as deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets each quarter by assessing the likelihood of future profitability and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million 
these assets included million for the value of tax loss and credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance of million was recorded to reduce the tax assets to the net value management believed was more likely than not to be realized 
in the event our operating performance deteriorates  future assessments could conclude that a larger valuation allowance will be needed to further reduce the deferred tax assets 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to tax audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we reduce our net tax assets for the estimated additional tax and interest that may result from tax authorities disputing uncertain tax positions we have taken and we believe we have made adequate provision for income taxes for all years that are subject to audit based upon the latest information available 
a more complete description of our income taxes and the future benefits of our tax loss and credit carryforwards is disclosed in note  income taxes  to our consolidated financial statements 
pension benefits we sponsor a number of pension plans primarily in the us and the uk and to a lesser degree in various other countries 
in the uk and the uk we have several major defined benefit plans that are separately funded 
we account for our pension programs in accordance with employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans under gaap 
gaap requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined using an actuarial basis 
as a result  our pension benefit programs are based on a number of statistical and judgmental assumptions that attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to our plans each year at december these assumptions include discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  future compensation increases  employee turnover rates  actuarial assumptions relating to retirement age  mortality rates and participant withdrawals 
the actuarial assumptions we use may differ significantly from actual results due to changing economic conditions  participant life span and withdrawal rates 
these differences may result in a material impact to the amount of net periodic pension expense to be recorded in our consolidated financial statements in the future 
the expected long term return on plan assets is used in calculating the net periodic pension expense 
we considered several factors in developing our expected rate of return on plan assets 
the long term rate of return considers historical returns and expected returns on current and projected asset allocations and is generally applied to a five year average market value of return 
projected returns are based primarily on broad  publicly traded equity and fixed income indices and forward looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations it is anticipated that our us investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return was percent  combined with the very favorable returns in has eliminated the significant deterioration in pension assets experienced in as a result of the credit crisis and related market recession 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent per year in for us pension assets is reasonable 

table of contents the methodology used to determine the rate of return on pension plan assets in the uk was based on establishing an equity risk premium over current long term bond yields adjusted based on target asset allocations 
as of december   based upon our target asset allocations  it is anticipated that our uk investment policy will generate an average annual return over the year projection period equal to or in excess of percent approximately percent of the time while returns of percent or greater are anticipated percent of the time 
we expect additional positive returns from active investment management 
the one year return for our uk plan exceeded percent for and similar to our us plan  the market related deterioration in our plan assets has been eliminated 
our strategy with respect to our investments in pension plan assets is to be invested with a long term outlook 
therefore  the risk and return balance of our asset portfolio should reflect a long term horizon 
based on the historical returns and forward looking return expectations  we believe an investment return assumption of percent in for uk pension assets is reasonable 
our pension plan asset allocation at december  and and target allocation for are as follows us plans us plans percentage of plan assets at december  percentage of plan assets at december  target allocation target allocation investment description equity securities fixed income real estate other total the differences between the actual return on plan assets and expected long term return on plan assets are recognized in the asset value used to calculate net periodic expense over five years 
the table below sets forth the expected return assumptions used to develop our pension expense for the period and our expected rate of return for long term expected return assumptions us plans uk plans a lower expected rate of return will increase our net periodic pension expense and reduce profitability 
gaap for pensions offers various acceptable alternatives to account for the differences that eventually arise between the estimates used in the actuarial valuations and the actual results 
it is acceptable to delay or immediately recognize these differences 
under the delayed recognition alternative  changes in pension obligation including those resulting from plan amendments and changes in the value of assets set aside to meet those obligations are not recognized in net periodic pension cost as they occur but are recognized initially in comprehensive income and subsequently amortized as components of net periodic pension cost systematically and gradually over future periods 
in addition to this approach  gaap also allows immediate recognition of actuarial gains or losses 
immediate recognition introduces volatility in financial results 
we have chosen to delay recognition and amortize actuarial differences over future periods 
if we adopted the immediate recognition approach  we would record a loss of  million million after tax for our us and us pension plans 
the difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred from recognition in our results of operations and  under certain circumstances such as when the difference 
table of contents exceeds percent of the market value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation pbo  amortized over future years of service 
this is also true of changes to actuarial assumptions 
as of december   we had net pension actuarial losses of million and million for the us and us pension plans  respectively 
under gaap  the actuarial gains and losses are recognized and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
increases in actuarial losses decreased our shareholders equity by million after tax in the increases were due to liability losses from reduced discount rates  partially offset by improved plan asset performance in as these amounts exceed percent of our pbo  the excess is amortized over the average remaining service lives of participating employees 
the table below sets forth the net periodic pension expense for the period through and our expected expense for net periodic pension expense in millions pension expense we expect pension expense to be increased significantly over  due to the unfavorable impacts of higher service cost due to increased headcount  decreased discount rates and lower expected asset returns for our uk plan as we de risk plan trust assets moving toward more conservative investments 
the decrease in periodic pension expense in compared to was due to improved returns on assets and strong contributions in the decrease in periodic pension expense in compared to was due to improved returns on assets as the capital markets began to recover and strong contributions in another key assumption used in the development of the net periodic pension expense is the discount rate 
the weighted average discount rates used to develop our net periodic pension expense are set forth in the table below 
discount rates us plans uk plans changes in the discount rate assumptions will impact the interest cost component of the net periodic pension expense calculation 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date 
the guidelines for setting this rate are discussed in gaap which suggests the use of a high quality corporate bond rate 
we used bond information provided by moody investor service inc  standard poor rating services  fitch ratings and dominion bond rating 
all bonds used to develop our hypothetical portfolio in the us and us were high quality  non callable bonds aa or better as of december   by at least two of the bond rating agencies 
the average yield of this hypothetical bond portfolio was used as the benchmark for determining the discount rate to be used to value the obligations of the plans subject to gaap for pensions and other postretirement benefits 
our model called for years of benefit payments for the us plans and years of payments for the uk for both countries  our model matches the present value of the plan projected benefit payments to the market value of the theoretical settlement bond portfolio 
a single equivalent discount rate is determined to align the present value of the required cash flow with the value of the bond portfolio 
the resulting discount rate is reflective of both the current interest rate environment and the plan distinct liability characteristics 

table of contents the table below sets forth the estimated impact on our net periodic pension expense relative to a change in the discount rate and a change in the expected rate of return on plan assets 
in millions impact on pension expense increase decrease discount rate used to value liabilities percent increase percent decrease expected rate of return on assets one percent increase one percent decrease the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
a higher discount rate decreases the plan obligations and decreases our net periodic pension expense 
a lower discount rate increases the plan obligations and increases our net periodic pension expense 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
note  pension and other postretirement benefits  to our consolidated financial statements provides a summary of our pension benefit plan activity  the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements accounting pronouncements recently adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended its rules regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the objective of this amendment was to improve the comparability  consistency and transparency of financial reporting and to increase the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income 
specifically  this amendment requires that all non owner changes in shareholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in addition  the standard also requires disclosure of the location of reclassification adjustments between other comprehensive income and net income on the face of the financial statements 
the new rules became effective for us beginning january  in december  the fasb deferred certain aspects of this standard beyond the current effective date  specifically the provisions dealing with reclassification adjustments 
because the standard only impacts the display of comprehensive income and does not impact what is included in comprehensive income  the standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb amended its standards related to fair value measurements and disclosures 
the objective of the amendment was to improve the comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
primarily this amendment changed the wording used to describe many of the requirements in us gaap for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in addition to clarifying the board intent about the application of existing fair value measurement requirements 
the new standard also requires additional disclosures related to fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy and requires disclosure of the categorization in the hierarchy for items which are not recorded at fair value but fair value is required to be disclosed 
the new rules were effective for us beginning january  as of december   we had no fair value measurements categorized within level outside of our pension plans 
the only impact for us is the disclosure of the categorization in the fair value hierarchy for those items where fair value is only disclosed primarily our debt 
table of contents obligations 
our disclosure related to the new standard is included in note  fair value of financial instruments  to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting pronouncements issued but not yet effective in december  the fasb amended its standards related to offsetting assets and liabilities 
this amendment requires entities to disclose both gross and net information about certain instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and certain instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting agreement 
this information will enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
the new rules will become effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   and interim periods within those annual periods 
it is also required that the new disclosures are applied for all comparative periods presented 
in january  the fasb further amended this standard to limit its scope to derivatives  repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements  securities borrowings and lending transactions 
we do not believe this amendment will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial statements 
while we are still finalizing our analysis  due to the scope limitation we also do not expect any significant changes to our footnote disclosures 
in february  the fasb amended its standards on comprehensive income by requiring disclosure in the footnotes of information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
specifically  the amendment will require disclosure of the line items of net income in which the item was reclassified only if it is reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
it will also require cross reference to other disclosures for amounts that are not reclassified in their entirety in the same reporting period 
the new disclosures will be required for us prospectively only for annual periods beginning january  and interim periods within those annual periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial risk resulting from volatility in foreign exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
this risk is closely monitored and managed through the use of financial derivative instruments including foreign currency forward contracts  commodity swap contracts  commodity zero cost collars and interest rate swaps 
as stated in our policies and procedures  financial derivatives are used expressly for hedging purposes  and under no circumstances are they used for speculative purposes 
when material  we adjust the value of our derivative contracts for counter party or our credit risk 
further information regarding financial instruments and risk management is contained in note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
the following describes our risk exposures and provides results of sensitivity analysis performed as of december  the sensitivity analysis assumes instantaneous  parallel shifts in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
foreign exchange rates as a result of our international business presence  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
we transact business in foreign currencies and  as a result  our income experiences some volatility related to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
to help manage our exposure to exchange rate volatility  we use foreign exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to hedge forecasted intercompany and third party sales and purchases denominated in non functional currencies 
our internal policy allows for managing anticipated foreign currency cash flows for up to one year 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated and qualify as foreign currency cash flow hedges under gaap 
the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the forward contract is deferred 
table of contents and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction sale or purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  unrealized gain or loss  if any  is recognized in current income during the period of change 
as of december   the amount we expect to reclassify from aocl to income over the next year is an unrealized net gain of million 
for the years ended december  and  there were no circumstances that would have resulted in the discontinuance of a foreign currency cash flow hedge 
to minimize the income volatility resulting from the remeasurement of net monetary assets and payables denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are considered economic hedges 
the objective is to offset the gain or loss from remeasurement with the gain or loss from the fair market valuation of the forward contract 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedges under gaap 
as of december   the potential gain or loss in the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the currencies of such contracts  would be approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of foreign exchange movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to our consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
we manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations through the use of interest rate swaps 
the objective of the swaps is to more effectively balance our borrowing costs and interest rate risk 
in november  we entered into an interest rate swap to effectively convert our million debt issue  due in  from a fixed rate of percent to a floating rate based on a libor spread 
the terms of the swap mirror those of the debt  with interest paid semi annually 
this swap qualifies as a fair value hedge under gaap 
the gain or loss on this derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current income as interest expense 
the following table summarizes these gains and losses for the years presented below for the years ended december  in millions income statement classification gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings gain loss on swaps gain loss on borrowings interest expense commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices due to contractual agreements with component suppliers 
in order to protect ourselves against future price volatility and  consequently  fluctuations in gross margins  we periodically enter into commodity swap contracts with designated banks to fix the cost of certain raw material purchases with the objective of minimizing changes in inventory cost due to market price fluctuations 
certain commodity swap contracts are derivative contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges under gaap 
we also have commodity swap contracts that represent an economic hedge but are not designated for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings 
for those contracts that qualify for hedge accounting  the effective 
table of contents portion of the unrealized gain or loss is deferred and reported as a component of aocl 
when the hedged forecasted transaction purchase occurs  the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified into income in the same line item associated with the hedged transaction in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects income 
the ineffective portion of the hedge  if any  is recognized in current income in the period in which the ineffectiveness occurs 
as of december   we expect to reclassify an unrealized net loss of less than million from aocl to income over the next year 
our internal policy allows for managing these cash flow hedges for up to three years 
as of december   the potential gain or loss related to the outstanding commodity swap contracts  assuming a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of such commodities  was million 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in commodity prices assumes the notional value to remain constant for the next months 
the analysis ignores the impact of commodity price movements on our competitive position and potential changes in sales levels 
it should be noted that any change in the value of the swap contracts  real or hypothetical  would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items see note  derivatives  to the consolidated financial statements
