item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note regarding amounts and fiscal year references in this annual report  all amounts related to united states dollars and foreign currency and to the number of nordson corporation s common shares  except for per share earnings and dividend amounts  are expressed in thousands 
unless otherwise noted  all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending october critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances 
actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management 
certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below 
on a regular basis  critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
the fasb has issued guidance on multiple deliverable arrangements that establishes a relative selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vendor specific objective evidence is not available  or best estimated selling price besp if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence is available 
our multiple deliverable arrangements include installation  installation supervision  training  and spare parts  which tend to be completed in a short period of time  at an insignificant cost  and utilizing skills not unique to us  and  therefore  are typically regarded as inconsequential or perfunctory 
revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within accrued liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet 
revenues deferred in  and were not material 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level  or more often if indications of impairment exist 
our reporting units are the adhesive dispensing systems segment  the industrial coating systems segment and one level below the advanced technology systems segment 
we test goodwill in accordance with accounting standards codification asc the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
in the first step  performed in the fourth quarter of each year  we calculate a reporting unit s fair value using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology and compare the result against the reporting unit s carrying value of net assets 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is close to or exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to determine if goodwill is impaired 
we used independent valuation specialists to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values using discounted cash flow dcf methodology for our reporting units and other long lived assets and to prepare indications of value derived from a market approach using guideline companies and a reconciliation to results of the dcf approach 
in step one  the assumptions used for discounted cash flow  revenue growth  operating margin  and working capital turnover are based on general management s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends 
terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the gordon growth model method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant weighted average cost of capital wacc methodology and growth 
table of contents rate 
for each reporting unit  a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness that our expected assumptions are fair for detecting impairment 
discount rates are developed using a wacc methodology 
the wacc represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors 
for  the discount rates used ranged from percent to percent depending upon the reporting unit s size  end market volatility  and projection risk 
the calculated internal rate of return for the step one consolidated valuation was percent  the same as the calculated wacc for total nordson 
to test the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow valuations  we performed the control premium test  which compares the sum of the fair values calculated for our reporting units net of debt to the market value of equity 
the control premium was negative percent as of the test date of august  and october  the control premium indicated that the discounted cash flow valuation was reasonable 
in addition  indications of value derived for each reporting unit using the market approach reconciled reasonably with the results of the discounted cash flow approach 
in and  the results of our step one testing indicated no impairment  therefore  the second step of impairment testing was not necessary 
the excess of fair value fv over carrying value cv was compared to the carrying value for each reporting unit 
based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of august   our conclusion is that no indicators of impairment exist in potential events or circumstances  such as a sustained downturn in global economies  could have a negative effect on estimated fair values 
wacc excess of fv over cv goodwill adhesive dispensing systems segment industrial coating systems segment advanced technology systems segment electronics systems advanced technology systems segment fluid management advanced technology systems segment test inspection the table above does not include two acquisitions that occurred after the august measurement date but before our fiscal year end 
we acquired the kreyenborg group s kreyenborg gmbh and bkg bruckmann kreyenborg granuliertechnik gmbh the kreyenborg group on august  and certain assets from nellcor puritan bennett mexico  sa de cv  a subsidiary of covidien lp on september  determination of the preliminary goodwill associated with these acquisitions was completed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists in october since the dates of the valuations  no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of these acquisitions below their carrying values 
for future valuation purposes  the kreyenborg group will be included in our adhesive dispensing systems segment  and the assets acquired from nellcor will be included in advanced technology systems fluid management 
other long lived assets we test other depreciable and amortizable long lived assets for recoverability in accordance with asc using undiscounted cash flows 
long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
the total carrying value of long lived assets for each reporting unit has been compared to the forecasted cash flows of each reporting unit s long lived assets being tested 
cash flows have been defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization  less annual maintenance capital spending 
estimates of future cash flows used to test the recoverability of a long lived asset asset group are based on the remaining useful life of the asset 
we believe that the relative value of long lived assets within each reporting unit is a reasonable proxy for the relative importance of the assets in the production of cash flow 
to get to a reasonable forecast period  the aggregate net book value of long lived assets was divided by the current depreciation and amortization value to arrive at a blended remaining useful life 
our calculations for showed the undiscounted aggregate value of cash flows over the remaining useful life for each reporting unit was greater than the respective carrying value of the long lived assets within each reporting unit  so no impairment charges were recognized 

table of contents inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost was determined using the last in  first out lifo method for percent of consolidated inventories at october   and percent at october   with the first in  first out fifo method used for the remaining inventory 
on an ongoing basis  inventory is tested for technical obsolescence  as well as for future demand and changes in market conditions 
we have historically maintained inventory reserves to reflect those conditions when the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
reserves are also maintained for inventory used for demonstration purposes 
the inventory reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
pension plans and postretirement medical plans the measurement of liabilities related to our pension plans and postretirement medical plans is based on management s assumptions related to future factors  including interest rates  return on pension plan assets  compensation increases  mortality and turnover assumptions  and health care cost trend rates 
the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october  and percent at october  the weighted average discount rate used to determine the present value of our various international pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  the discount rates used for all plans were determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled 
in determining the expected return on plan assets  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans 
we consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions 
the expected rate of return long term investment rate on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was percent in and percent in the average expected rate of return on international pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was percent in and percent in the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was percent at october  and october  the assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our international pension plan obligations was percent at october   compared to percent at october  annual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year 
differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years 
economic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
the effect of a one percent change in the discount rate  expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below 
bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts 
united states international point increase point decrease point increase point decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  expected return on assets effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  compensation increase effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on pension obligation as of october  
table of contents with respect to the domestic postretirement medical plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit plan was percent at october  and percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in for the international postretirement plan  the discount rate used to value the benefit obligation was percent at october  and percent at october  the annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits the health care cost trend rate is assumed to be percent in  decreasing gradually to percent in the discount rate and the health care cost trend rate assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
for example  a one percentage point change in the discount rate and assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects united states international point increase point decrease point increase point decrease discount rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of october  health care trend rate effect on total service and interest cost components in effect on postretirement obligation as of october  employees hired after january   are not eligible to participate in the domestic postretirement medical plan 
pension and postretirement expenses in are expected to be approximately  lower than  primarily due to changes in discount rates 
financial instruments assets  liabilities and commitments that are to be settled in cash and are denominated in foreign currencies are sensitive to changes in currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which are derivative financial instruments  to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from the collection of receivables  payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies 
the maturities of these contracts are usually less than days 
forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and therefore are marked to market each accounting period  and the resulting gains or losses are included in other net within other income expense in the consolidated statement of income 
warranties we provide customers with a product warranty that requires us to repair or replace defective products within a specified period of time generally one year from the date of delivery or first use 
an accrual is recorded for expected warranty costs for products shipped through the end of each accounting period 
in determining the amount of the accrual  we rely primarily on historical warranty claims 
amounts charged to the warranty reserve were   and  in  and  respectively 
the reserve balance was   and  at october   and  respectively 
long term incentive plan ltip under the long term incentive plan  executive officers and selected other key employees receive share awards based on corporate performance measures over three year performance periods 
awards vary based on the degree to which corporate performance equals or exceeds predetermined threshold  target and maximum performance levels at the end of a performance period 
no award will occur unless certain threshold performance objectives are equaled or exceeded 
the amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections for each three year period and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered 
the calculations are also based upon the grant date fair value determined using the closing market price of common stock at the grant date  reduced by the implied value of dividends not to be paid 
awards are recorded as capital in excess of stated value in shareholders equity 
the cumulative amount recorded at october  for the plans originating in  and was  compensation expense attributable to all ltip performance periods for executive officers and selected other key employees for  and was   and  respectively

recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued guidance amending the way companies test for goodwill impairment 
companies will have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine the existence of events or circumstances that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  companies determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
this guidance did not change our annual process for goodwill impairment testing or impact the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an accounting standards update asu requiring new disclosures for reclassifications from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income 
companies are required to present these disclosures either on the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this guidance is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of it will only be a change in disclosure  so we do not believe the adoption of this asu will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued an asu which requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carry forward that would apply in settlement of uncertain tax positions 
under the new standard  unrecognized tax benefits will be netted against all available same jurisdiction loss or other tax carry forwards that would be utilized  rather than only against carry forwards that are created by the unrecognized tax benefits 
the new guidance is effective prospectively to all existing unrecognized tax benefits  but entities can choose to apply it retrospectively 
the guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of  with early adoption permitted

purchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that the combination of present capital resources  internally generated funds and unused financing sources are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for there are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company 
outlook our operating performance  balance sheet position  and financial ratios for remained strong relative to and recent years  although uncertainties persisted in global financial markets and the general economic environment 
going forward  we are well positioned to manage our liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements  capital expenditures  contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations  and principal and interest payments on indebtedness 
primary sources of capital to meet these needs as well as other opportunistic investments are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements

with respect to borrowing under existing loan agreements  as of october   we had  available capacity under our five year term   unsecured  multicurrency credit facility 
in addition  we had  borrowing capacity remaining on our  three year private shelf agreement with new york life investment management llc 
while these facilities provide the contractual terms for any borrowing  we cannot be assured that these facilities would be available in the event that these financial institutions failed to remain sufficiently capitalized 
other loan agreements exist with no remaining borrowing capacity  but factor into debt covenant calculations that affect future borrowing capacity 
on july   we entered into a note purchase agreement with a group of insurance companies under which we sold  of senior notes 
the notes mature between july and july and bear interest at fixed rates between percent and percent

respective to all of these loans are two primary covenants  the leverage ratio that restricts indebtedness net of cash to a maximum times consolidated four quarter trailing ebitda and the interest coverage ratio that requires four quarter trailing ebitda to be at minimum three times consolidated trailing four quarter interest expense 
debt  ebitda  and interest expense are as defined in respective credit agreements 
with respect to these two primary covenants as of october   we were approximately percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 
table of contents and approximately nine times the most restrictive interest coverage ratio 
unused borrowing capacity under existing loan agreements would amount to an additional percent of the most restrictive leverage ratio 
we move forward with caution regarding expectations for  given persistent uncertainties related  for example  to the eurozone s economic recovery  us deficit reduction issues  prospects for growth in emerging markets  and expectations for global gdp improvement out of a low growth macroeconomic environment 
though the pace of improvement in the global economy remains somewhat unclear  our growth potential has been demonstrated over time from our capacity to build and enhance our core by entering emerging markets and pursuing market adjacencies 
we drive value for our customers through our application expertise  differentiated technology  and direct sales and service support 
our priorities also focus on operational improvements by employing continuous improvement methodologies to our business processes 
we expect these efforts will continue to provide more than sufficient cash from operations for meeting our liquidity needs and paying dividends to common shareholders  as well as enabling us to invest in the development of new applications and markets for our technologies and pursue strategic acquisition opportunities 
for  excluding voluntary contributions to us defined benefit plans in  cash from operations have been to percent of revenues  resulting in more than sufficient cash for our ordinary business requirements 
our available borrowing capacity will enable us to make opportunistic investments in our own common shares and strategic business combinations 
with respect to contractual spending  the table above presents our financial obligations as  of which  is payable in as of august   we have in place a stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors and authorizing management at its discretion to repurchase shares up to  as of october   we have  remaining under this authorization 
the repurchase program is funded using cash from operations and proceeds from borrowings under our credit facilities 
timing and actual number of shares subject to repurchase are contingent on a number of factors including levels of cash generation from operations  cash requirements for acquisitions  repayment of debt and our share price 
capital expenditures for will be focused primarily upon our continued efforts to leverage our information systems platform and invest in projects that improve both capacity and efficiency of manufacturing and distribution operations 
effects of foreign currency the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices  sales volume  product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate 
as a general rule  a weakening of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income  while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect 
in  as compared with  the united states dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies 
if exchange rates had been in effect during  sales would have been approximately  higher and third party costs would have been approximately  higher

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions 
these contracts  primarily associated with the euro  yen and pound sterling  typically have maturities of days or less  and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for united states dollars at rates stated in the contracts 
gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains  respectively  on the underlying transactions 
other transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as hedges of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries or are intercompany transactions of a long term investment nature 
as a result of the use of foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to reduce the risks related to most of our transactions denominated in foreign currencies  as of october   we did not have material foreign currency exposure
