item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general management overview in april  the company acquired parlux  further enhancing its position as a manufacturer  wholesale distributor and specialty retailer of fragrances and related products 
the company has merged some of parlux operations  including sales  marketing  finance and human resources  with its new york offices 
management will continue integrating the operations of parlux over the next twelve months and expects to realize greater margins on fragrances licensed by parlux and sold through the qfg  perfumania and sow divisions 
management also expects that the increased size of the company will help obtain more and higher profile fragrance licenses  which will broaden the company product offerings and enhance revenue and gross margins 
management also anticipates that the company will continue to realize operating synergies  resulting in reduced aggregate costs in distribution  promotional activities  administration and operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  for us gaap reporting  the accompanying results of operations and cash flows for fiscal contain parlux results beginning on april   the date of the acquisition 
during fiscal  the company also continued focusing on managing expenses  improving inventory turns at its retail stores and consignment locations and maximizing working capital 
management also continued to close underperforming perfumania retail stores  while selectively opening new locations 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  due to increases in retail sales and wholesale sales 
of the million increase in net sales  is attributable to the fifty third week in fiscal retail sales increased compared to the prior year as a result of increases in sales for both perfumania and sow  driven by increases in prices per unit as well as in customer traffic 
wholesale sales increased by from the prior year primarily as a result of the parlux acquisition 
total gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  largely due to the parlux acquisition 
operating expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in operating expenses for fiscal and are million and million  respectively  of expenses related to the merger with parlux 
also included in operating expenses are million and million of asset impairment and share based compensation expense  respectively  in fiscal asset impairment expense in fiscal was million and share based compensation expense was million 
including million of interest expense  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal compared with a net income of million in fiscal the following table sets forth selected items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of total net sales for the periods indicated 
table of contents percentage of net sales fiscal year ended february  fiscal year ended january  total net sales total gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses asset impairment share based compensation expense merger related expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss income from operations interest expense loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  asset impairments  sales returns and allowances  deferred taxes and other contingent assets and liabilities 
as such  some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements 
the judgments and estimates made can significantly affect results 
materially different amounts might be reported under different conditions or by using different assumptions 
we consider an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and requires significant judgment and estimates by management in its application 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies that affect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements 
accounts receivable  net of allowances in the normal course of business  we extend credit to wholesale customers that satisfy pre determined credit criteria 
accounts receivable  net of allowances  as shown on the consolidated balance sheets  is net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through the analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements  assessments of collectability based on an evaluation of historical and anticipated trends  the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the impact of economic conditions 
should circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate significantly  we may need to increase our provisions 
inventory adjustments and writeoffs inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and potentially slow moving inventory based on prior sales  forecasted demand and historical experience and through specific identification of obsolete or damaged merchandise and we record adjustments to reduce the carrying value of inventory to the lower of cost or market in accordance with our assessment 
if actual sales are less than our forecasts  additional writeoffs could be necessary 
inventory shrinkage is estimated and accrued between physical inventory counts 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future undiscounted cash flows in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses 
inherent in this process is significant management judgment as to the projected cash flows 
upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations 
property and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest 
table of contents level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment 
cash flows for perfumania retail assets are identified at the individual store level 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a history of operating losses combined with negative future outlook  or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
judgments are also made as to whether future lease renewal options will be exercised  lease exit clauses will be exercised  negotiations for rent reductions with landlords will be successful and under performing stores should be closed 
even if a decision has been made not to close an under performing store  the assets at that store may be impaired 
perfumania store asset impairment charges of approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and impairment charges on a building under a capital lease of approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively  are included in asset impairment on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as the projection of future cash flows requires the use of judgments and estimates  if actual results are materially different than these judgments or estimates  additional charges could be necessary 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
accounting for acquisitions  intangible assets and goodwill under the accounting for business combinations  consideration paid in an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the consideration paid at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired or liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one area that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
because the fair value and the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands  the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks  tradenames  customer relationships  favorable leases and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives such as our perfumania tradename are not amortized but rather assessed for impairment at least annually 
we typically perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not fully be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter ended february   we completed our annual impairment assessment of the perfumania tradename  brand licenses and goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
in assessing the fair value of this tradename  we utilized the income approach  based on the relief from royalty methodology 
for goodwill  we elected to quantitatively test for impairment by comparing the book value of goodwill with the fair value of the reporting unit where our goodwill resides 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flow and certain market value data 
we also reviewed our other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment using the income approach 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the analysis and assessments of these assets and goodwill indicated that no impairment adjustment was required in fiscal as the estimated fair value exceeded the recorded carrying values 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate the expected future cash flows of our reporting units and the long term trends of our market capitalization for the purposes of assessing the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite lived perfumania tradename  other trademarks and intangible assets 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate  this could increase the likelihood of future material noncash impairment charges to our results of operations related to our goodwill  indefinite lived perfumania tradename  or other trademarks and intangible assets 
sales and allowances for sales returns revenue from wholesale transactions is recorded when title passes 
wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and allowances 
revenue from retail sales is recorded  net of discounts  at the point of sale for perfumania stores  and for consignment sales  when sale to the ultimate customer occurs 
revenue from internet sales is recognized at the time products are delivered to customers 
we record an estimate of returns  discounts and allowances  and review and refine these estimates on a regular basis based on current experience and trends 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our us department store customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance for product that does not sell 
table of contents through to customers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns or markdowns based on our level of sales  historical sell through and projected experience with product returns  current economic trends and changes in assessment of customer demand 
we make detailed estimates at the product and customer level  which are then aggregated to arrive at a consolidated provision for product returns and markdowns and are reviewed periodically as facts and circumstances warrant 
such provisions and markdown allowances are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns  it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates 
if  for example  customer demand for our products is lower than estimated or a proportionately greater amount of sales are made to prestige department stores and or specialty beauty stores  additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
similarly  if customer demand for our products is higher than estimated  a reduction of our provision for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in an increase to income in the period in which the determination was made 
sales returns generally follow seasonal gift giving periods such as mother father day and christmas 
in addition  the global economic downturn of the past few years has also led retailers to reduce inventory levels  thereby increasing returns after the major gift giving seasons 
valuation of deferred tax assets accounting guidance requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that a portion of these assets will not be realized 
the guidance also prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and also provides guidance on various related matters such as derecognition  interest and penalties  and disclosure 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carry forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors 
the range of possible judgments relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets is very wide 
significant judgment is required in making these assessments and it is very difficult to predict when  if ever  our assessment may conclude that the remaining portion of our deferred tax assets is realizable 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected in calculating deferred tax assets could result in material additional adjustments to our deferred tax assets and income tax expense 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year net sales we recognized net sales of million in fiscal  an increase of from the million recorded in fiscal the breakdown of sales between retail and wholesale was as follows fiscal year ended february  percentage of net sales fiscal year ended january  percentage of net sales dollar change dollar change due to parlux acquisition dollar change excluding parlux acquisition percent change excluding parlux acquisition in thousands retail wholesale total net sales net sales increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sales included an increase in retail sales of million and an increase in wholesale sales of million 
the fifty third week in fiscal resulted in million and million of retail and wholesale sales  respectively 
excluding the results of parlux  net sales increased by million 
retail sales increased by from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase in perfumania s retail sales of million and an increase in sow s consignment sales of million 
perfumania s retail sales increased by from million in to million in fiscal the average number of stores operated was in fiscal compared with in fiscal perfumania s comparable store sales increased by during fiscal comparable store sales measure sales from stores that have been open for one year or more 
we exclude stores that are closed for renovation from comparable store sales from the month during which renovation commences until the first full month after reopening 
the average retail price per unit sold during fiscal increased by from fiscal primarily due to increases in selling prices of some products  and the total number of units sold 
table of contents increased by 
the increase in the number of units sold was due primarily to the additional week included in fiscal compared with fiscal  as discussed earlier  which resulted in million of additional sales 
sow s consignment sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in sow s net sales is due primarily to an increase in sales by sow largest customer offset by the loss of two consignment customers during fiscal excluding the results of parlux  the decrease in wholesale sales of million is the result of less product availability for qfg and less customer demand during fiscal compared with the prior year

this will impact future quarters until the remaining fair market value purchase accounting adjustment of approximately million is expensed 
excluding the results of parlux  the decrease in cost of goods sold was due to lower sales by qfg as discussed above and lower cost on fragrances licensed by parlux and sold by qfg  perfumania and sow divisions  offset by higher retail cost of goods sold

perfumania s retail gross profit for fiscal increased by to million compared with million in for these same periods  perfumania s retail gross margins were and  respectively 
wholesale gross profit percentage increased from during fiscal to during fiscal excluding the results of parlux  gross profit percentage during fiscal was 
during fiscal  parlux gross profit was reduced by approximately million to expense a portion of the purchase accounting adjustment to record parlux acquired inventory at fair market value at the acquisition date

operating expenses operating expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include payroll and related benefits for our distribution centers  sales  store operations  field management  purchasing and other corporate office and administrative personnel  rent  common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities for our stores  distribution centers and corporate office  advertising  consignment fees  sales promotion  royalties  insurance  supplies  freight out  and other administrative expenses 
the breakdown of operating expenses was as follows for the year ended in thousands february  january  percentage increase decrease selling  general and administrative asset impairment share based compensation expense merger related expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses loss income from operations selling  general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding the results of parlux  selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are expenses in connection with service agreements with quality king distributors  inc quality king  which were million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these service agreements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
impairment charges of during fiscal consists of relating to long lived assets at certain underperforming perfumania retail stores and for a capital lease on a building 
we recorded similar charges of million for perfumania retail store long lived assets and million for the capital lease in fiscal share based compensation expense of million during fiscal represents the expense incurred on stock options granted during the period 
merger related expenses during fiscal and consist mainly of investment banking and legal fees incurred for the parlux acquisition which closed in april depreciation and amortization was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal approximately million of amortization expense in fiscal relates to amortization on identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the acquisition of parlux 
as a result of the foregoing  we recognized loss from operations in fiscal of approximately million compared to income from operations in fiscal of million 

table of contents other expenses for the year ended in thousands february  january  percentage increase interest expense interest expense was approximately million for fiscal compared with approximately million in fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to a higher average outstanding balance on the company revolving credit facility  as well as a higher overall average outstanding balance on the company notes payable to affiliates during fiscal compared with fiscal income tax benefit provision for the year ended in thousands february  january  percentage decrease income tax benefit provision our effective tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of compared with for fiscal in fiscal  the effective tax rates differed from our federal statutory rates primarily due to changes in our valuation allowances and net operating loss adjustments and expirations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we recognize valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider past taxable income  estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
net loss income as a result of the foregoing  we realized a net loss of approximately million in fiscal  compared to net income of million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal funding requirements are for inventory purchases  financing extended terms on accounts receivable  paying down accounts payable and debt  information systems enhancements  opening new stores and renovation of existing stores 
these capital requirements generally have been satisfied through cash flows from operations  borrowings under the respective revolving credit facilities and notes payable to affiliates 
our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales occurring from september to december each year 
wholesale sales are stronger during the months of september through november  since retailers place orders in anticipation of the holiday season  while retail sales are the greatest in december 
we experience seasonality in our working capital  as our accounts receivable and inventory levels normally peak from august to november 
our working capital borrowings are also seasonal  and our borrowings under our senior credit facility are normally highest in the months of october and november 
the senior credit facility is a million revolving secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks  which is used for our general corporate purposes and those of our subsidiaries  including working capital 
revolving loans under the senior credit facility may be drawn  repaid and reborrowed up to the amount available under a borrowing base calculated with reference to a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible credit card receivables  a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible trade receivables and a specified percentage of the borrowers eligible inventory from time to time  which may be reduced by the lender in its reasonable discretion 
the senior credit facility also includes a sub limit of million for letters of credit and a sub limit of million for swing line loans that is  same day loans from the lead or agent bank 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries are co borrowers under the senior credit facility  and our other subsidiaries have guaranteed all of their obligations 
the company and its subsidiaries are required to maintain availability under the facility of at least the greater of of the aggregate amount that may be advanced against eligible credit card receivables  trade receivables and inventory or million 
at february   we were in compliance with all financial and operating 
table of contents covenants under the senior credit facility and we had borrowing availability of million  based on the borrowing base at that date 
we also have a number of unsecured notes payable outstanding to certain family trusts of members of the nussdorf family that in aggregate total million of principal 
no payments of principal may be made on any of these notes payable to affiliates before the maturity of the senior credit facility  although interest payments are permitted under certain conditions  including the company maintaining excess availability under the senior credit facility of million or of commitment and a fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the senior credit facility  of further information about the senior credit facility and these notes payable to affiliates is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
during fiscal  the company obtained financing for the cash portion of the consideration payable in the parlux merger from two sources 
first  we used borrowings under the senior credit facility of million to fund a portion of the merger consideration and approximately million to fund costs of the merger and related transactions 
second  we borrowed a total of million from the nussdorf family trusts described above  which amount is subordinated to the senior credit facility on the same basis as the company existing indebtedness to the trusts 
cash provided by used in operating activities primarily represents loss income before depreciation and noncash charges and after changes in working capital 
working capital is significantly impacted by changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
the million decrease in cash flows from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the net loss for fiscal compared with the net income in fiscal and changes in working capital 
our accounts receivables decreased in fiscal due to lower wholesale sales in fiscal compared to fiscal inventory levels decreased in fiscal due to an effort by management to optimize and reduce inventory levels resulting in lower inventory purchases  and accounts payable fluctuations are generally determined by the timing of merchandise purchases and payments 
our purchases from related parties described in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements are generally payable in days  however due to the seasonality of our business  these terms are generally extended 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal fiscal investing activities primarily related to the payment of million to acquire parlux  net of parlux million cash on hand 
during fiscal  we renovated existing perfumania stores  opened new stores and relocated stores 
at february   perfumania operated stores 
we plan to open a minimum of stores in fiscal and plan to close approximately stores 
we anticipate spending approximately million in fiscal on capital expenditures  which will be used primarily for information technology enhancements  including the planned purchase and implementation of a new fully integrated enterprise resource planning erp system  and also perfumania new store construction and remodels 
the deployment of the erp system is anticipated to occur in phases over a multi year schedule  and the inception of the project and timing of the roll out is subject to change based on various factors 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate new store growth rate in light of economic conditions and may adjust the growth rate as conditions change 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal was approximately million  primarily because of the million borrowed under our senior credit facility  net of cash and cash equivalents acquired from parlux and the million borrowed from affiliates to fund the cash paid for parlux  compared with net cash used in financing activities of approximately million in fiscal a summary of our cash flows for fiscal and fiscal is as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  fiscal year ended january  summary cash flow information cash used in provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities increase in cash cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash balances and the available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  our affiliated borrowings and our projected future operating results will generate sufficient liquidity to support the company s working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service in the short and long term 
however  as discussed above  the amount of availability under the senior credit facility depends on our eligible receivables and inventory at any given time  and may be further reduced by our bankers  which could have a material adverse 
table of contents effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our bankers also would have the right to terminate our senior credit facility if we default on our covenants  which would require us to seek alternative financing in a highly unfavorable credit environment 
furthermore  the state of the national economy may worsen  which would further restrict customers ability to purchase fragrance products 
any of these circumstances  as well as any of the matters discussed in risk factors above  could have a materially adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition  so there can be no assurance that management s plans and expectations will be successful 
significant contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s significant contractual obligations at february  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet at february   while others are disclosed as future obligations 
payments due by periods total less than year years years more than years revolving credit facility notes payable affiliate capital lease obligations operating lease obligations minimum royalty obligations minimum advertising and promotional spending obligations this balance represents principal only as the interest rate is variable and accrues on outstanding balances which vary throughout the year 
excludes any amounts related to maintenance  taxes  insurance and other charges payable under operating lease agreements due to the future variability of these amounts 
obligations under license agreements require royalty payments and required advertising and promotional spending levels for our products bearing the licensed trademark 
royalty payments are typically made based on contractually defined net sales 
however  certain licenses require minimum guaranteed royalty payments regardless of sales levels 
minimum guaranteed royalty payments and required minimums for advertising and promotional spending have been included in the table above 
actual royalty payments and advertising and promotional spending could be higher 
furthermore  early termination of any of these license agreements could result in potential cash outflows that have not been reflected above
