item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes included in item the following information includes forward looking statements  the realization of which may be affected by certain important factors discussed under risk factors 
overview we provide solutions and services that make data centers more efficient  manageable and responsive to changing business needs 
focused on mid and large size companies  we assess  design  deploy  and support infrastructures such as servers  storage and networks 
we also resell hardware and software from the industry leading oems as part of our customer offerings 
our portfolio of solutions and services spans four practices consolidation and virtualization  data storage protection  advanced network infrastructures and business continuity and disaster recovery solutions 
we offer a full suite of practice specific consulting  analysis  design  implementation  management  and support services 
our solutions can include hardware products  such as servers  disk arrays  tape systems  networking and interconnection components and software products 
our data center strategy is supported through multiple trends in the market and involves supporting the market and our customers with a single vendor to provide their data center infrastructure needs 
as of december   we have locations  including both leased facilities and home offices  throughout the united states 
we historically have derived our greatest percentage of net sales from customers located in the central part of the united states 
we sell support service contracts to most of our customers 
in about half of the support service contracts that we sell  our customers purchase support services through us  resulting in customers receiving the benefit of integrated system wide support 
we have a qualified  independent support desk that takes calls from customers  diagnoses the issues they are facing and either solves the problem or coordinates with our and or vendor technical staff to meet the customer needs 
our support service agreements with our customers include an underlying agreement with the product manufacturer 
the manufacturer provides on site support assistance if necessary 
the other half of the support service contracts that we sell to our customers are direct with the product manufacturers 
for all support service contracts we sell  we defer revenues and direct costs resulting from these contracts  and amortize these revenues and expenses into operations  over the term of the contracts  which are generally one to three years 
the data center infrastructure solutions and services market is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
our competition includes other independent storage  server and networking system integrators  high end value added resellers  distributors  consultants and the internal sales force of our suppliers 
our ability to hire and retain qualified outside sales representatives and engineers with enterprise class information storage  server and networking experience is critical to effectively competing in the marketplace and achieving our growth strategies 
in the past  we have experienced fluctuations in the timing of orders from our customers  and we expect to continue to experience these fluctuations in the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  among other things  the time required to design  test and evaluate our data center infrastructure solutions before customers deploy them  the size of customer orders  the complexity of our customers network environments  necessary system configuration to deploy our solutions and new product introductions by suppliers 
current economic conditions and competition also affect our customers decisions and timing to place orders with us and the size of those orders 
as a result  our net sales may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we view the current data center infrastructure market as providing significant opportunity for growth 
currently  our market share is a small part of the overall market 
however  the providers of the data center infrastructure industry products and technologies are increasing their utilization of indirect sales approaches to broaden their reach and optimize their margins 
increasingly  they are turning to companies such as us to sell their products 
while these trends provide opportunity for us  we must improve our business model to generate sustainable  profitable growth 
our model requires highly skilled sales and technical staff which results in substantial fixed costs for us 
we believe the best way to improve our company and create long term shareholder value is to focus on building scalable capabilities and a leverageable cost structure 
our current strategies are focused on increasing our sales team productivity 
scaling our existing geographic locations and expanding into new locations 
expanding our customer support revenues 
enhancing our consulting and professional services business 
expanding our managed services portfolios 
to pursue these strategies  we are improving our training  tools and recruiting efforts for sales and technical teams to increase productivity 
investing in customer facing teams to acquire top tier sales and technical talent which we believe will increase our market share in key locations 
deepening our presence in existing enterprise accounts and penetrating new enterprise accounts 
exploring potential acquisitions that we believe can strengthen our resources and capabilities in key geographic locations 
targeting high growth market segments and deploying new technologies which focus on cost saving technologies for our customers 
driving high levels of efficiency by streamlining our supply chain and expanding our professional services tools 
expanding our customer support capabilities and tools based professional services offerings that we believe will provide more value to our customers 
all of these plans have various challenges and risks associated with them  including those described under risk factors in this annual report 
acquisitions we have completed acquisitions to grow our business in the past and we intend to continue to grow our business by select acquisitions 
our recent acquisitions are described below 
strategic technologies  inc on october   we purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of strategic technologies  inc stratech from stratech and midas medici group holdings  inc midas  parent company of stratech  and together with stratech  the sellers 
stratech is an it services and solutions firm that shares our focus on optimizing enterprise data centers and it infrastructure through a common product and services portfolio designed to help customers increase business agility 
we purchased stratech for an estimated purchase price of approximately million  comprised of a cash payment of approximately million  which is offset by a receivable due from the sellers of approximately million  resulting from the preliminary estimated working capital adjustment 
in addition  we issued  shares of our common stock with a value of approximately million 
those shares have been deposited in an escrow account as security for certain indemnification obligations of the sellers

we recorded the receivable due from sellers of approximately million related to this payment at december  sellers are disputing the amount owed to us in connection with this reconciliation payment 
the asset purchase agreement contains an arbitration provision for disputes over the value of tangible net assets 
the amount of the receivable we recorded may be impacted by the resolution of the arbitration proceeding 
as of the filing of this form k  no resolution had been reached  and the parties are reviewing the working capital calculations and determining the timing for arbitration 
this acquisition expanded our market share and physical presence across the eastern seaboard of the united states 
the acquisition also allows us to diversify our product offerings from certain manufacturers and expand our high margin professional and managed services business lines 
we expect to experience operational synergies and efficiencies through combined general and administrative corporate functions 
our results for reflect the addition of stratech for the fourth quarter 
please see note to our financial statements for further information 
midwave corporation 
in october  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with midwave and its shareholders

this acquisition expanded our footprint in minnesota making us the dominant data center services and infrastructure provider in the region 
the acquisition also doubled our cisco technology and services revenues  expanded our managed services portfolio with the addition of a data center infrastructure monitoring service  added an established security practice including product  services and consulting and doubled the size of our consulting services team 
we have realized operational synergies and efficiencies through combined general and administrative corporate functions 
our results for reflect the addition of midwave for the fourth quarter 
please see note to our financial statements for further information 
acquisitions on december   we acquired the reseller business of incentra  which designs  procures  implements and supports data center solutions composed of technologies including storage  networking  security and servers from leading manufacturers 
we did not acquire incentra managed services portfolio and related operations 
we accomplished the acquisition through the purchase of substantially all of the assets of incentra reseller business pursuant to an asset purchase agreement and have included the financial results of incentra in our financial statements beginning on the acquisition date 
on october   we acquired the networking solutions division of minneapolis based cross telecom cross  which qualified as a business combination 
we completed an asset purchase of million paid in cash 
simultaneously  cross entered into an agreement with us to purchase at least million of networking products and services from us over the next three years 
cross has agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount 
the agreement was entered into outside of the acquisition and was assigned no fair value 
in september and  the first and second years of the three year agreement came to an end and there was a shortfall paid by cross of  and  respectively  which was recorded as other income since we had assumed the revenue targets 
in october  we entered into an agreement with cross to allow for an early buyout of the remaining year of the agreement for which cross paid  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported earnings 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the areas of customer receivables  inventories  investments  income taxes  self insurance reserves and commitments and contingencies 
we believe that the following represent the areas where we use more critical estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our financial statements revenue recognition 
effective january  we recognize revenue in accordance with the asc amended by fasb as summarized in asu no 
 software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we generally recognize software and hardware revenue upon shipment  installation and configuration services upon completion and customer support contracts ratably over the term of the contract 
please see note to our financial statements in part ii  item included with this annual report on form k for a more detailed description of our revenue recognition policy 
for and sales contracts entered into prior to fiscal year  we recognized revenue pursuant to the previous guidance for multiple element arrangements 
refer to the critical accounting policies in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading critical accounting policies and estimates for a discussion of the previous accounting policy 
business combinations 
we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we expect to acquire additional businesses in the future 
in a business combination  we determine the fair value of all acquired assets  including identifiable intangible assets  and all assumed liabilities 
we allocate the fair value of the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities in amounts equal to the fair value of each asset and liability 
we classify any remaining fair value of the acquisition as goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows we expect to generate with the acquired assets 
we amortize certain identifiable  finite life intangible assets  such as service agreements  certifications  trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships  on a straight line basis over the intangible asset estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from three months to eight years 
we do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets we determine to have indefinite lives 
accordingly  the accounting for acquisitions has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our operating results 
during and  we applied business combination accounting to our acquisitions of stratech and midwave 
see note to our financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information about the application of business combination accounting to these acquisitions 
valuation of goodwill 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we assess the carrying amount of our goodwill for potential impairment annually or more frequently if events or a change in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
we have only one operating and reporting unit that earns revenues  incurs expenses and makes available discrete financial information for review by our chief operations decision maker 
accordingly  we complete our goodwill impairment testing on this single reporting unit 
testing for goodwill impairment is a two step process 
the first step screens for potential impairment 
if there is an indication of possible impairment  we must complete the second step to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of our market capitalization with the carrying value of our net assets 
if our total market capitalization is at or below the carrying value of our net assets  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss we record  if any 
we consider goodwill impairment test estimates critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts 
valuation of long lived assets  including finite lived intangibles 
in accordance with fasb asc topic  property  plant  and equipment  we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
stock based compensation 
we utilize the fair value method of accounting to account for share based compensation awards 
this requires us to measure and recognize in our statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes model to determine the fair value of share based payment awards 
our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables  will affect our determination of fair value 
we determine the fair value of restricted stock grants based upon the closing price of our stock on the grant date 
we base recognition of compensation expense for our performance based  non vested shares on management estimate of the probable outcome of the performance condition 
management reassesses the probability of meeting these performance conditions on a quarterly basis 
changes in management estimate of meeting these performance conditions may result in significant fluctuations in compensation expense from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued an update to asc fair value measurement asc amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the update requires an entity with fair value measurement disclosures to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and ifrs 
the guidance changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements  particularly for level fair value measurements 
the update to asc was effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued an update to asc intangibles goodwill and other asc testing goodwill for impairment 
the update allows an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under these amendments  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments include a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the update to asc is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning  after december  adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued an update to asc testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
this update states that an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to determine the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying amount in accordance with asc under the guidance in this update  an entity also has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative impairment test 
an entity will be able to resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
the amendments to asc are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september  we do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our financial statements

our results for both product sales and service sales include revenues of approximately million from the acquisition of stratech 
additionally  our results include a full year of revenue from the midwave acquisition in late our results for both product sale and service sales include revenues of approximately million from the acquisition of midwave 
the increase in our products sales in as compared to  reflects the impact of our stratech acquisition in october  continued growth in our customer base including growth in customers with multi million dollar accounts with us  and market acceptance of our ongoing strategy to service the complete data center  as evidenced by increases in our storage and networking product sales

our storage  server and network sales have increased as part of our strategy to deliver data center hardware  software and services 
our more recent product sales continue to reflect our customers closer scrutiny of expenditures as they focus more attention on the actual or anticipated impact that current economic conditions may have on the growth and profitability of their businesses

without sustainable growth in our product sales going forward  we expect that our customer support contracts sales may suffer and we cannot assure that our future customer support contract sales will not decline 
we had no single customer account for or greater of either our product or service sales for the years  or however  our top five customers collectively accounted for   and of our   and revenues  respectively 
gross profit 
our total gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in  decreasing from in and in product gross profit as a percentage of product sales was in as compared to in and in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales is impacted by the mix and type of projects we complete for our customers 
the decrease in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales in was primarily due to the increase in our networking and server revenue stream  which historically has carried lower gross margins than our storage revenue stream 
our networking and server revenue stream increased to of our total revenues in  as compared with in our product gross profit as a percentage of product sales for over improved as our strategy of selling total solutions into the data center matured 
we expect that as we continue implementing our strategy to sell comprehensive data center solutions with servers and networking products that our product gross margins for will be between and 
our product gross profit was also impacted by the various programs we have in place with our vendors that provide economic incentives for achieving various sales performance targets and early payment of invoices 
achieving these targets contributed favorably to our product gross profit by million of product cost of sales  million of product cost of sales  and million of product cost of sales in   and  respectively 
these vendor programs constantly change and we negotiate them separately with each vendor 
while we expect the incentive and early pay programs to continue  the vendors could modify or discontinue them  particularly in light of current economic conditions  which would unfavorably impact our product gross profit margins 
service gross profit as a percentage of service sales was in as compared to in and in in and  the decrease in our service gross profit is due to a continued increase in the sales of products on which we were not able to sell first call support and our professional services 
these sales generally carry lower gross margins 
our service gross profit for reflects  of incentra related acquisition accounting adjustments to reduce acquired maintenance contracts to fair value 
excluding these adjustments  service gross profit margin would have been for we estimate that our service gross margins for will continue to be between and 
our total gross profit for  and includes amortization of intangibles of  million and million related to order backlog acquired in connection with our midwave acquisition in and our incentra acquisition in these finite lived intangible assets each have an estimated life of three months and one year  respectively  and were each fully amortized in and  respectively 
operating expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing general and administrative engineering other income integration and transaction costs amortization of intangibles total operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include wages and commissions paid to sales and marketing personnel  travel costs and advertising  promotion and hiring expenses 
we expense advertising costs as incurred 
sales and marketing expenses totaled million  or of net sales for as compared to million  or of net sales for and million  or of net sales for the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for over is due to an increase in our sales and marketing headcount from the stratech acquisition and higher variable compensation and commissions  commensurate with the increase in sales for the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for over is due to increase in our sales and marketing headcount from the midwave acquisition and higher variable compensation and commissions as related to our increase in sales for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales from to and to  respectively  reflects the improvement in revenues per employee we have realized as part of our growth strategy 
as we continue to selectively hire additional outside sales representatives  our sales and marketing expenses may increase without a commensurate increase in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include wages for administrative personnel  professional fees  depreciation  communication expenses and rent and related facility expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  for  and million  or of net sales  for our general and administrative expense increased million in  but decreased as a percentage of sales to from over the same period 
our general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to  but as a percentage of net sales it decreased to from over the same period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for was primarily due to an increase of  in salary and benefit expenses commensurate with the increase in headcount  an increase of  in depreciation expenses commensurate with the increase in fixed assets resulting from our acquisitions of midwave in october and stratech in october  and an increase of  in consulting expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for was due to a combination of an increase in bonus variable compensation of  commensurate with the increase in sales and gross margins for and an increase in stock compensation expense of  due to additional grants issued in the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from to and to  respectively  reflects the operational synergies and efficiencies we have begun to realize through combined general and administrative corporate functions in and engineering 
engineering expenses include employee wages and travel  hiring and training expenses for our field and customer support engineers and technicians 
we allocate engineering costs associated with installation and configuration services and with consulting services to our cost of service sales 
engineering expenses increased to million  or of net sales in compared to million  or of net sales in and million  or of net sales in the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales for over is primarily due to the stratech acquisition  which increased engineering headcount by approximately in the fourth quarter of the increase in engineering expenses in absolute dollars for over is primarily due to the midwave acquisition  which increased engineering headcount by approximately in the fourth quarter of the decrease in engineering expenses as a percentage of sales for as compared to is primarily a result of a greater percentage of our engineering costs being allocated to our cost of service sales since a greater percentage of our installation and configuration services were performed in by our engineering personnel 
other income 
for  and  we had other income of  million and  respectively 
our cross acquisition included a reverse earn out agreement  which required cross to purchase at least million of networking products and services from us over three years 
cross agreed to pay any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount 
we believed that we would meet the revenue targets and accordingly  we determined that the reverse earn out had no fair value at the date of this business combination or in any subsequent periods prior to the settlement date 
at september  and  as the first and second years of the three year reverse earn out agreement came to an end  there was a shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase of  and  respectively 
per the services agreement any shortfall between customer purchases and the guaranteed annual purchase amount would be payable by cross at that time 
since we had assumed that the revenue targets would be met and the reverse earn out had no fair value  the shortfall amounts of  and  represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date reverse earn out and  in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operating expenses on our statement of operations 
in addition  in october  we entered into an agreement with cross to allow for an early buyout of the third year reverse earn out agreement for which cross paid  this early buyout also represented a change in fair value of the acquisition date and in accordance with asc was classified as other income within operating expenses on our statement of operations 
integration and transaction costs 
we had integration expenses of   and  in  and  respectively 
in  we incurred these expenses for the acquisition of stratech in october in  we incurred the majority of these expenses for the acquisition of midwave in october integration and transaction expenses in and for the stratech and midwave acquisitions included audit  legal and other outside consulting fees and expenses for our transition services agreements with former stratech and midwave employees 
in  we incurred the majority of these expenses for the acquisition of the reseller business of incentra in december integration expenses in for the incentra acquisition are related to facility abandonment costs and our transition services agreement which consists of transition benefits  retention bonuses and severances of terminated employees  some of whom assisted with the initial integration of incentra 
intangible amortization 
we had expenses related to the amortization of finite lived intangible assets of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets increased in  and due to the acquisitions of stratech  midwave  the networking solutions division of cross and the incentra reseller business 
the finite lived intangible asset we acquired in our acquisition of stratech consisted of customer relationships having an estimated life of five years that we are amortizing these assets using an accelerated amortization method  to match the pattern in which the economic benefits of that asset are expected to be consumed 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of midwave consisted of covenants not to compete  order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three years  three months and five years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our acquisition of the networking solutions division of cross consisted of a services agreement and certifications having estimated lives of four years and two years  respectively 
the finite lived intangibles we acquired in our incentra reseller business acquisition consisted of trademarks  order backlog and customer relationships having estimated lives of three years  one year and eight years  respectively 
we are amortizing the finite lived intangible assets we acquired in our acquisitions of midwave  the networking solutions division of cross and the incentra reseller business primarily using the straight line method 
we expect amortization expense to be approximately million in we perform an impairment test for finite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets  such as fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not recover the carrying value of such assets 
we recognize impairment based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
we generally measure fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses 
for   and  we identified no triggering events that required us to evaluate the impairment of our long lived assets 
operating earnings years ended december  in thousands earnings from operations we realized earnings from operations of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our earnings from operations in  and are a result of our higher revenues and gross margins as we realized the benefits of our stratech  midwave and incentra acquisitions and the implementation of our strategy to sell products and services to support the entire data center
