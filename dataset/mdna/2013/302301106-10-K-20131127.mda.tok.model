we generally lend from to of the collateral s estimated resale value depending on an evaluation of these factors  and up to based on scrap value 

table of contents through our lending guidelines  we targeted an annual redemption rate the percentage of loans made that are repaid  renewed or extended between and over the last three fiscal years 
if a customer does not repay  renew or extend a loan  the collateral is forfeited to us and becomes inventory available for sale 
we do not record loan losses or charge offs of pawn loans because the principal amount of an unpaid loan becomes the inventory carrying cost of the forfeited collateral

in our pawn stores and buy sell stores  we acquire inventory for retail sales through pawn loan forfeitures and through purchases of customers merchandise and purchases of new or refurbished merchandise from third party vendors 
we believe our ability to offer quality second hand goods and refurbished goods at prices significantly lower than original retail prices attracts value conscious customers 
the gross profit on sales of inventory depends primarily on our assessment of the loan or purchase value at the time the property is either accepted as loan collateral or purchased 
improper value assessment in the lending or purchasing process can result in lower margins or reduced marketability of the merchandise 
during fiscal  and  we realized gross margins on retail sales of  and  respectively

we record product protection  jewelry vip and layaway fees as sales revenue  as they are incidental to sales of merchandise 
our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we record a valuation allowance for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on the type and age of merchandise 
we generally establish a higher allowance percentage on general merchandise  as it is more susceptible to obsolescence  and establish a lower allowance percentage on jewelry  as it retains much greater commodity value 
the total allowance was of gross inventory at september  compared to at september  the lower valuation allowance is reflective of periodic analyses conducted to value the inventory based on aging  profitability  sell through rates and shrink in each classification  including jewelry and general merchandise 
in addition  the closing of certain pawn stores in mexico during fiscal favorably impacted this allowance at september  see item business discontinued operations below 
financial services we also offer a variety of financial services to customers who have limited access to other sources of credit

outstanding amounts on unsecured lines of credit are considered defaulted if customers do not timely make one required scheduled payment

although defaulted loans may be collected later  we charge the loan principal to bad debt upon default  leaving only active loans in the reported balance 
subsequent collections of principal are recorded as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
accrued service charges related to defaulted loans are deducted from service charge revenue upon loan default  and increase service charge revenue upon subsequent collection 
we provide for a valuation allowance on both the principal and service charges receivable based on recent default and collection experience 
our consumer loan balance represents the principal amount of all active non defaulted loans  net of this valuation allowance 
if a credit service customer defaults on a loan  we pay the lender the principal and accrued interest due under the loan and an insufficient funds fee and charge those amounts to bad debt expense 
we then attempt to collect those amounts from the customer 
subsequent recoveries are recorded as a reduction of bad debt at the time of collection 
we also record as bad debt expense an accrual of expected losses for principal  interest and insufficient fund fees we expect to pay the lenders on default of the lenders current loans

in determining whether to lend or provide credit services  we perform a review of customer information  such as making a credit reporting agency inquiry  evaluating and verifying income sources and levels  verifying employment and verifying a telephone number where the customers may be contacted 
auto title loans are secured by the titles to customers automobiles 
lending decisions and loan amounts are determined on the basis of customers income levels  an inspection of the automobile and title and reference to market values of used automobiles

at the time a line of credit is granted  customers receive a similar agreement specifying the terms of the credit line  fees and annual percentage rate and repayment terms 
seasonality historically  pawn service charges are highest in our fourth fiscal quarter july through september due to a higher average loan balance during the summer lending season 
merchandise sales are highest in the first and second fiscal quarters october through march due to the holiday season  jewelry sales surrounding valentine s day and the impact of tax refunds in the united states 
jewelry scrapping sales are heavily influenced by the timing of decisions to scrap excess jewelry inventory 

table of contents jewelry scrapping sales generally are greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter july through september 
this results from relatively low jewelry merchandise sales in that quarter and the higher loan balance  leading to a higher dollar amount of loan forfeitures in the summer lending season providing more inventory available for sale 
consumer loan fees are generally highest in our fourth and first fiscal quarters july through december due to a higher need for cash during the holiday season 
consumer loan bad debt  both in dollar terms and as a percentage of related fees  is highest in the fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in the second fiscal quarter due primarily to the impact of tax refunds in the us the payroll withholding lending business is less impacted by seasonality  with the exception of the summer months when new loan originations tend to moderate 
the net effect of these factors is that net revenues and net income typically are strongest in the fourth fiscal quarter and weakest in the third fiscal quarter

growth and expansion we plan to expand the number of locations we operate through opening de novo locations and through acquisitions 
we believe that the largest growth opportunities are with de novo stores in mexico and the us  pawn store acquisitions in the us and online lending  both in the us and internationally 
we continually evaluate and test new products and formats  which may result in expansion opportunities or strategic investments 
the cost of opening de novo stores varies based on the size  type and location of stores opened 
during fiscal  we opened de novo us canada locations  each requiring an average property and equipment investment of approximately  we also opened us financial services stores  each requiring an average property and equipment investment of approximately  in mexico  we opened de novo pawn stores  each requiring an average property and equipment investment of approximately  our ability to add new stores is dependent on several variables  such as the availability of acceptable sites or acquisition candidates  the regulatory environment  local zoning ordinances  access to capital and the availability of qualified personnel

table of contents other lenders may lend money on an unsecured basis  at interest rates that may be lower than our service charges  and on other terms that may be more favorable than ours or through other market channels  such as online  which some customers may prefer 
we believe that the primary elements of competition are the quality of customer service and relationship management  convenience  store location  a customer friendly environment and the ability to loan competitive amounts at competitive rates

failure to observe applicable regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of pawn licenses  the imposition of fines or requirements to refund service charges and fees  and other civil or criminal penalties 
we must also comply with various federal requirements regarding the disclosure of the annual percentage rate  finance charge  amount financed  total of payments and payment schedule related to each pawn loan transaction 
additional federal regulations applicable to our pawn lending business are described in other federal regulations below 

table of contents most of our pawn stores  voluntarily or pursuant to applicable laws  provide periodic generally daily reports to local law enforcement agencies 
these reports provide local law enforcement with information about the items received from customers whether through pawn or purchase  including a detailed description of the goods involved and the name and address of the customer 
if we accept as collateral or purchase merchandise from a customer and it is determined that our customer was not the rightful owner  the merchandise is subject to recovery by the rightful owner 
historically  we have not experienced a material number of claims of this nature 
some of our pawn stores in the us handle firearms and each of those stores maintains a federal firearms license as required by federal law 
the federal gun control act of and regulations issued by the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  and firearms also require each pawn store dealing in firearms to maintain a permanent written record of all receipts and dispositions of firearms 
in addition  we must comply with the brady handgun violence prevention act  which requires us to conduct a background check before releasing  selling or otherwise disposing of firearms 
mexico regulates various aspects of the pawn industry at the federal  state and local level 
regulations issued by the federal consumer protection agency  procuradur a federal del consumidor profeco  govern the form of pawn loan contracts and consumer disclosures  but the regulations do not impose interest rate or service charge limitations on pawn loans 
pawn stores  like other businesses in mexico  are also subject to a variety of regulations in such areas as tax compliance  customs  consumer protection and employment 
in canada  and in virginia and pennsylvania in the us  we operate stores that buy and sell secondhand merchandise  as opposed to offering pawn loans 
these stores are regulated by local municipalities or other local authorities 
the applicable ordinances vary from location to location and include licensing for secondhand dealing or precious metal purchasing  law enforcement reporting requirements  and the imposition of holding periods before a purchased item can be offered for resale 
failure to observe these regulations could result in a revocation or suspension of licenses  the imposition of fines  and other civil or criminal penalties 
our canadian buy sell stores also offer short term consumer loans 
short term consumer loan regulations each state in which we offer short term consumer loan products has specific laws and regulations dealing with the conduct of this business 
these laws and regulations vary in scope  but generally require licensing of locations  establish loan terms  provide for consumer protections and disclosures and permit periodic regulatory examinations 
in the case of single payment loans  most applicable laws and regulations limit the amount of fees that may be charged  establish maximum loan amounts and duration  and restrict the customer s ability to renew or extend the loan 
some states require reporting of customers loan activities to a state wide database  and prohibit the making of loans to customers who have loans outstanding with other lenders 
some municipalities in which we operate also impose various rules and regulations  primarily related to zoning and licensing requirements  but in some cases  related to loan terms such as maximum loan amounts  maximum number of renewals or extensions and mandatory principal paydowns 
failure to observe applicable legal requirements could result in a loss of license  the imposition of fines or customer refunds  and other civil or criminal penalties 
we must also comply with various federal requirements including the truth in lending act and regulation z regarding the disclosure of annual percentage rate  finance charge  amount financed  total of payments and payment schedule related to each loan transaction 
with respect to our debt collection activities  we are required to comply with the provisions governing creditors under the federal fair debt collection practices act and similar state laws regulating debt collection practices 
additional federal regulations applicable to our short term consumer loan business are described in other federal regulations below 
in texas  we do not make loans to customers  but rather offer fee based credit services  including assistance in arranging loans with independent third party lenders 
as required by state law  we are registered as a credit services organization cso in order to provide such services and  pursuant to state laws effective january   are licensed as a credit access business cab 
the applicable cso law requires us to provide each customer with an upfront disclosure statement describing  among other things  the services to be provided and the fees to be charged and  upon entering into a transaction  with a written contract fully describing the services provided 
the law prohibits us from receiving compensation solely for referring a customer to a lender and also provides for other disclosure requirements  cancellation rights for customers and prohibitions on fraudulent or deceptive conduct 
the law governing cabs requires us to provide conspicuous notices regarding fees and certain other disclosures and requires us to report certain information regarding customer transactions to the texas office of the consumer credit commissioner 
violations of these laws could subject us to criminal and civil liability 
the independent lenders are not required to be licensed and are not regulated by any state agency so long as the interest rate charged on the loan does not exceed per annum 
the lenders are also permitted to charge late fees and insufficient funds fees 
the lenders are subject to the federal regulations described below with regard to their lending activities 
certain cities in texas  specifically  
table of contents austin  dallas and san antonio  have enacted municipal regulation of cab products and the payday loans and auto title loans to which they provide access 
the city of houston recently announced that it will consider adopting similar regulations 
legislators and regulators frequently scrutinize the legislative and regulatory environment for short term lending  often proposing additional legislative and regulatory restrictions ranging from additional disclosure requirements to limits on rates and fees 
in some cases  rate and fee limits would effectively prohibit certain short term lending products  such as payday loans  because it would no longer be economically feasible for most lenders to offer such products 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  enacted in july  established the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  which exercises supervisory and examination powers over companies that offer payday loans 
the cfpb also may exercise regulatory authority over other products and services that we offer 
the cfpb recently issued payday loans and deposit advance products a white paper of initial data findings and concluded in part with respect to payday loans the cfpb recognizes its responsibility to implement federal consumer financial laws to ensure that markets for consumer financial products and services are fair  transparent and competitive 
the potential consumer harm and the data gathered to date are persuasive that further attention is warranted to protect consumers 
based upon the facts uncovered through our ongoing work in this area  the cfpb expects to use its authorities to provide such protections 
at this time it is not possible to accurately predict what affect the cfpb will have on our business 
there can be no assurance that legislative or regulatory efforts to eliminate or restrict the availability of certain short term loan products  including payday loans and auto title loans  will not be successful  despite significant customer demand 
to the extent such efforts are successful  our short term consumer loan business could be adversely affected 
see part i item a risk factors 
other federal regulations all of our lending activities  both pawn loans and short term consumer loans  are subject to other state and federal statutes and regulations  including the following we are subject to the federal gramm leach bliley act and its underlying regulations  as well as various state laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security 
under these regulations  we are required to disclose to our customers our policies and practices relating to the protection and sharing of customers nonpublic personal information 
these regulations also require us to ensure that our systems are designed to protect the confidentiality of customers nonpublic personal information  and many of these regulations dictate certain actions that we must take to notify customers if their personal information is disclosed in an unauthorized manner 
we are subject to the fair credit reporting act  which was enacted  in part  to address privacy concerns associated with the sharing of consumers financial information and credit history contained in consumer credit reports and limits our ability to share certain consumer report information 
we are subject to the federal fair and accurate credit transactions act  which amended the fair credit reporting act  and requires us to adopt written guidance and procedures for detecting  preventing and mitigating identity theft  and to adopt various policies and procedures including employee training that address and aid in detecting and responding to suspicious activity or identify theft red flags 
the federal equal credit opportunity act prohibits discrimination against any credit applicant on the basis of any protected category such as race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status or age provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract  because all or part of the applicant income derives from any public assistance program  or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the consumer protection act 
under the equal credit opportunity act and the fair credit reporting act  if we deny an application for credit  we are required to provide the applicant with a notice of adverse action  informing the applicant of a the action taken regarding the credit application  b a statement of the prohibition on discrimination  c the name and address of both the creditor and the federal agency that monitors compliance  d the applicant s right to learn the specific reasons for the denial  e whether the credit decision was based on in whole or in part on information obtained from the credit report  f a consumer right to a free copy of the credit report from the reporting agency  g the consumer right to dispute inaccurate information with the reporting agency and h whether our credit decision was based in whole or in part on information obtained from an affiliate or from an outside source other than a customer reporting agency and the right to know the nature of such information 

table of contents under the usa patriot act  we must maintain an anti money laundering compliance program that includes the development of internal policies  procedures and controls  the designation of a compliance officer  an ongoing employee training program  and an independent audit function to test the program 
we are also subject to the bank secrecy act and its underlying regulations  which require us to report and maintain records of certain high dollar transactions 
in addition  federal laws and regulations prohibit us from doing business with terrorists and require us to report certain suspicious transactions to the financial crimes enforcement network of the treasury department fincen 
generally  a transaction is considered to be suspicious if we know  suspect or have reason to suspect that the transaction a involves funds derived from illegal activity or is intended to hide or disguise such funds  b is designed to evade the requirements of the bank secrecy act or c appears to serve no legitimate business or lawful purpose 
certain of our subsidiaries are registered with fincen as money services businesses by virtue of the check cashing or money transmission services they provide 
federal law limits the annual percentage rate that may be charged on loans made to active duty military personnel and their immediate families at 
this annual percentage rate cap applies to a variety of loan products  including consumer loans  though it does not apply to pawn loans 
we do not make consumer loans to active duty military personnel or their immediate families because it is not economically feasible for us to do so at these rates 
we are subject to the electronic funds transfer act and its underlying regulations  which govern our ability to credit our customers bank accounts electronically with loan proceeds and to accept electronic payments from our customers by debiting our customers bank accounts through various electronic card payment networks  such as visa and mastercard  and other clearing house associations  such as nacha  the electronic payments association

item a 
risk factors there are many risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of our business 
many of these risks are beyond our control 
the following is a description of the important risk factors that may affect our business 
if any one or more of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
changes in laws and regulations affecting our financial services and products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 
our financial products and services are subject to extensive regulation under various federal  state  local and international laws and regulations 
there have been  and continue to be  legislative and regulatory efforts to regulate  prohibit or severely restrict some of the types of short term financial services and products we offer  particularly payday loans and auto title loans 
adverse legislation could be enacted in any country  state or municipality in which we operate 
if such legislation is enacted in any particular jurisdiction  we generally evaluate our business in the context of the new legislation and determine whether we can continue to operate in that jurisdiction with new or modified products or whether it is feasible to enhance our business with additional product offerings 
in any case  if we are unable to continue to operate profitably under the new law  we may decide to close or consolidate stores  resulting in decreased revenues  earnings and assets 
for example  in and  the cities of austin  dallas and san antonio  texas adopted municipal ordinances imposing restrictions on certain financial services products we can offer as a credit services organization or credit access business in those cities 
specifically  the ordinances require municipal registrations  limit the amount borrowers can borrow and require principal paydowns on refinancing or with each installment payment 
these limitations and restrictions make the products less attractive to our customers  thus lessening demand  and severely impair the financial viability of our financial services business in those cities 
we recently closed financial services stores in dallas  primarily due to the onerous regulatory requirements 
table of contents of the municipal ordinance 
see item business discontinued operations 
the city of houston recently announced that it will consider adopting a similar ordinance 
in addition  any financial services business that we undertake directly in international jurisdictions  as well as the financial services businesses conducted by our strategic affiliates  are subject to a variety of regulation by international governmental authorities 
adverse legislation or regulations could be enacted in any of such international jurisdictions  with the result that the financial services business in that jurisdiction becomes less profitable or unprofitable 
for example  the consumer credit and corporations legislation amendment enhancements bill was passed by the australian parliament in august this new law  which went into effect on july   imposes certain limitations and restrictions on short term consumer loans in australia  including interest limitations and restrictions on extensions and refinancings 
see part i business strategic investments 
further  the financial conduct authority  which on april   will assume primary regulatory authority over short term consumer lending in the uk  recently released guidance that focuses on the affordability of the credit extended ie  the customer s ability to repay  the use of continuous payment authority to collect repayments and sustained use short term credit products 
this guidance  when it becomes effective regulation  along with other regulations that may be issued in the future  could have an adverse impact on our online lending business in the uk many of the legislative and regulatory efforts that are adverse to the short term consumer loan industry are the result of the negative characterization of the industry by some consumer advocacy groups and some media reports that ignore the credit risk and high transaction costs of serving our customers 
we can give no assurance that there will not be further negative characterizations of our industry or that legislative or regulatory efforts to eliminate or restrict the availability of certain short term loan products  including payday loans and auto title loans  will not be successful despite significant customer demand for such products 
such efforts  if successful  could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial performance 
a significant or sudden decrease in gold values or the volume of gold transactions may have a material impact on our earnings and financial position 
gold jewelry comprises a significant portion of the collateral security for our pawn loans and our inventory  and gold scrapping accounts for a significant portion of our revenues and gross profit 
pawn service charges  sales proceeds and our ability to liquidate excess jewelry inventory at an acceptable margin are dependent upon gold values and the volume of gold transactions 
a decline in the availability of gold or our customers willingness or ability to sell us gold or use gold as collateral for pawn loans could significantly impact our business 
during fiscal and fiscal  we experienced a significant softening of gold prices and volumes  which had a significant negative impact on our profitability 
the impact on our financial position and results of operations of a continued decrease in gold values or volumes or a change in customer behavior cannot be reasonably estimated because the market and customer response to changes in gold values is not known  however  a significant decline in gold values or gold volumes could result in decreases in sales  sales margins and pawn service charge revenues 
the consumer financial protection bureau has begun exercising its supervisory role over short term  small dollar lenders  which could result in a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 
as noted under item business regulation short term consumer loan regulations  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act established the consumer financial protection bureau the cfpb  which has the power to  among other things  regulate companies that offer or supply payday loans and other products and services that we offer 
the cfpb now exercises its supervisory and regulatory authority over non depository companies providing consumer financial services products and services 
under its supervisory and examination powers  the cfpb has authority to inspect short term lenders books and records and lending practices  including marketing  underwriting  loan application and processing and collections 
the cfpb has published its short term  small dollar lending examination procedures  outlining the guidelines that cfpb examiners will use in examining short term lenders 
the cfpb has begun to conduct examinations of payday loan companies to assess companies compliance with federal consumer financial services laws  obtain information on the activities and procedures of short term lenders and detect risks to consumers 
should the cfpb determine that a financial service provider is in violation of federal law  it has broad authority to initiate administrative actions or litigation  in which it may seek cease and desist orders for the provider s activities  rescission of loan contracts and administrative fines and penalties 
the cfpb also has rule making authority over short term lenders 
while it does not have authority to regulate fees  it conceivably could adopt rules that could impair the viability or financial performance of products and services 
on april   the cfpb issued a report following an in depth review of short term small dollar loans  including payday loans 
while the cfpb acknowledges the clear demand for small dollar credit products  it does express concern regarding the risk of sustained use of these products by some consumers 
the cfpb reiterated its authority to adopt rules identifying unfair  deceptive or abusive practices in connection with the offering of consumer financial products and services and stated that it expects to use its authority to provide such protections 
it is not possible to accurately predict what affect the cfpb will have 
table of contents on our business 
the cfpb  through its supervisory or enforcement role or through its rule making authority  could take actions that would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance 
a significant portion of our business is concentrated in texas 
as of september   over half of our financial services stores and almost half of our domestic pawn stores were located in texas  and those stores account for a significant portion of our revenues and profitability 
with the exception of activity at the municipal level that has negatively impacted or may negatively impact our financial services business  the legislative  regulatory and general business environment in texas has been relatively favorable for our business activities 
we have been successful in growing and expanding our businesses in areas outside texas for the past several years  and we expect that our business in other areas will continue to grow faster than our business in texas 
a negative legislative or regulatory change in texas could have a material adverse effect on our overall operations and financial performance 
we offer short term consumer loans in texas through our credit services organization program in both storefronts and online 
if new adverse legislation is enacted in texas  it could require us to alter or discontinue some or all of our consumer loan business in texas 
during the most recent regular legislative session which ended in may  the texas senate passed a bill that  had it been enacted into law  would have adversely affected our consumer loan business in texas 
the bill included caps on fees  limitations on the amounts that can be loaned  limitations on the number of refinancings  cooling off periods and other restrictions 
that bill failed to gain sufficient support in the texas house of representatives and was not enacted into law 
there can be no assurance that similar legislation will not be considered  or possibly enacted  during future legislative sessions 
even if no legislation is enacted at the state level  various municipalities may still consider and enact ordinances that restrict short term consumer loans as dallas  austin  san antonio and several smaller cities have already done  and houston is proposing to do 
a significant change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and financial position 
we have foreign operations in mexico  canada and the united kingdom and equity investments in the united kingdom and australia 
our assets and investments in  and earnings and dividends from  each of these must be translated to us dollars from their respective functional currencies 
a significant weakening of any of these foreign currencies could result in lower assets and earnings in us dollars  resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
prolonged periods of economic recession and unemployment could adversely affect our lending and retail businesses 
all of our businesses  like other businesses  are subject to fluctuations based on varying economic conditions 
economic conditions and general consumer confidence affect the demand for our retail products and the ability and willingness of our customers to utilize our loan products and services 
our consumer loan products and services require the customer to have a verifiable recurring source of income 
consequently  we may experience reduced demand for our consumer loan products during prolonged periods of high unemployment 
weakened economic conditions may also result in an increase in loan defaults and loan losses 
even in the current economic environment  we have been able to efficiently manage our bad debt through our underwriting and collection efforts 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain our current bad debt rates or that we will not experience increasing difficulty in collecting defaulted loans 
a significant portion of our short term consumer loan revenues and profitability is dependent upon the ability and willingness of unaffiliated lenders to make loans to our customers 
in texas  where over half of our financial services stores are located  we do not make consumer loans to customers  but assist customers in arranging loans with unaffiliated lenders 
we also have a similar arrangement for our online lending business in ohio 
our credit services organization or credit access business could be adversely affected if a we were to lose our current relationships with unaffiliated lenders and were unable to establish a relationship with another unaffiliated lender who was willing and able to make short term loans to our texas customers or b the unaffiliated lenders are unable to obtain capital or other sources of funding at appropriate rates 
achievement of our growth objectives is dependent upon our ability to open and acquire new stores 
our expansion strategy includes opening de novo store locations and acquiring existing stores 
the success of our de novo store strategy is contingent upon numerous factors that cannot be predicted or controlled  such as the availability of acceptable locations with a desirable customer base  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms  the ability to obtain required government permits and licenses and the existence of a suitable competitive environment 
in addition  our acquisition strategy is dependent upon the availability of attractive acquisition candidates 
the achievement of our growth objectives is also subject to our ability 
table of contents to attract  train and retain qualified team members 
failure to achieve our expansion goals would adversely affect our prospects and future results of operations 
changes in the business  regulatory or political climate in mexico could adversely affect our operations in those countries  which could adversely affect our growth plans 
our growth plans include significant expansion in mexico 
changes in the business  regulatory or political climate in mexico  or significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates  could affect our ability to expand or continue our operations there  which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects  results of operations and cash flows 
fluctuations in our sales  pawn loan balances  sales margins  pawn redemption rates and loan default and collection rates could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
we regularly experience fluctuations in a variety of operating metrics 
changes in any of these metrics  as might be caused by changes in the economic environment  competitive pressures  changes in customers tastes and preferences or a significant decrease in gold prices could materially and adversely affect our profitability and ability to achieve our planned results of operations 
changes in our liquidity and capital requirements or in banks abilities or willingness to lend to us could limit our ability to achieve our plans 
we require continued access to capital 
a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 
we currently have a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
if one of those banks is unable to provide funding in accordance with its commitment  our available credit could be reduced 
our current credit facility is scheduled to terminate in may our ability to obtain a new credit facility or alternative financing will depend upon market conditions and our financial condition at the time 
if we are unable to obtain a new credit facility or other alternative financing on terms that are acceptable to us  our ability to achieve our growth objectives  and our financial condition and results of operations  may be adversely affected 
changes in competition from various sources could have a material adverse impact on our ability to achieve our plans 
we encounter significant competition from other pawn stores  cash advance companies  credit service organizations  credit access businesses  online lenders  consumer finance companies and other forms of financial institutions and other retailers  many of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do 
significant increases in the number or size of competitors or other changes in competitive influences could adversely affect our operations through a decrease in the number or quality of loan products and services we are able to provide or our ability to liquidate forfeited collateral at acceptable margins 
one person beneficially owns all of our voting stock and controls the outcome of all matters requiring a vote of stockholders  which may influence the value of our publicly traded non voting stock 
phillip e 
cohen is the beneficial owner of all of our class b voting common stock 
as a result of his equity ownership stake  mr 
cohen controls the outcome of all issues requiring a vote of stockholders and has the ability to control our policies and operations 
all of our publicly traded stock is non voting stock 
consequently  stockholders other than mr 
cohen have no vote with respect to the election of directors or any other matter requiring a vote of stockholders except as required by law 
this lack of voting rights may adversely affect the market value of our publicly traded class a non voting common stock 
in addition  we have regularly entered into  and may continue to enter into  advisory services agreements with madison park  llc  a financial advisory firm wholly owned by mr 
cohen 
see part iii item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence related party transactions agreement with madison park 
infrastructure failures and breaches in data security could harm our business 
we depend on our information technology infrastructure to achieve our business objectives 
if a problem  such as a computer virus  intentional disruption by a third party  natural disaster  telecommunications system failure or lost connectivity impairs our infrastructure  we may be unable to process transactions or otherwise carry on our business 
an infrastructure disruption could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers and revenue  result in the unintentional disclosure of company or customer information and require us to incur significant expense to eliminate these problems and address related data security concerns 

table of contents our online short term consumer lending business is subject to additional risks 
in addition to being subject to the various federal  state and local regulations that are applicable to short term consumer lending generally  our online short term consumer loan business both in the us and the us is subject to other regulations and risks 
for example  we will be dependent on third parties  referred to as lead providers  to provide us with prospective new customers 
generally  lead providers operate separate websites to attract prospective customers and then sell those leads to online lenders 
as a result  the success of our online consumer lending business depends substantially on the willingness and ability of lead providers to send us customer leads at prices acceptable to us 
the loss or a reduction in leads from lead providers  or the failure of our lead providers to maintain quality and consistency in their programs or services  could reduce our customer prospects and could have a material adverse effect on the success of this line of business 
furthermore  the lead providers failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations  or any changes in laws or regulations applicable to lead providers  could have an adverse effect on our online consumer lending business 
federal legislation was introduced in the us in july that  if enacted in its current form  would prohibit the use of lead providers or generators to secure consumer business 
if such legislation were to be enacted  it would significantly impact the manner in which the online lending business is conducted  and could significantly negatively affect the success and profitability of our online lending business 
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business 
currently and from time to time  we are defendants in various legal and regulatory actions 
while we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of any current actions  we believe their resolution will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
however  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or an injunction prohibiting us from conducting our business as we currently do 
if we were to receive an unfavorable ruling in a matter  our business and results of operations could be materially harmed 
we invest in companies for strategic reasons and may not realize a return on our investments 
we currently have significant investments in albemarle bond holdings plc and cash converters international limited  both of which are publicly traded companies based outside the united states 
we have made these investments  and may in the future make additional investments in these or other companies  to further our strategic objectives 
the success of these strategic investments is dependent on a variety of factors  including the business performance of the companies in which we invest and the market s assessment of that performance 
if the business performance of any of these companies suffers  then the value of our investment may decline 
if we determine that an other than temporary decline in the fair value exists for one of our equity investments  we will be required to write down that investment to its fair value and recognize the related write down as an investment loss 
based on our review of albemarle bond and its business as of september   we wrote down our investment and recognized an investment loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal see item business strategic investments albemarle bond 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of some or all of the investment on favorable terms  should we decide to do so in the future 
any realized investment loss would adversely affect our results of operations 
we may incur property  casualty or other losses not covered by insurance 
we maintain a program of insurance coverage for various types of property  casualty and other risks 
the types and amounts of insurance that we obtain vary from time to time  depending on availability  cost and our decisions with respect to risk retention 
the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self insurance basis 
losses not covered by insurance could be substantial and may increase our expenses  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquisitions  investments and other transactions could disrupt our ongoing business and harm our results of operations 
in pursuing our business strategy  we routinely conduct discussions  evaluate opportunities and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions  investments and other transactions 
these transactions may involve significant challenges and risks  including risks that we may not realize the expected return on an acquisition or investment  that we may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired business  or that we may experience difficulty in integrating acquired businesses into our business systems and processes 
if we do enter into agreements with respect to acquisitions  investments or other transactions  we may fail to complete them due to inability to obtain required regulatory or other approvals or other factors 
furthermore  acquisitions  investments and other transactions require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business 
these factors could harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents we could be subject to changes in tax rates  the adoption of new tax laws in the us or other countries  or exposure to additional tax liabilities 
we are subject to taxes in the us and several foreign jurisdictions 
current economic and political conditions make tax rates in any of these jurisdictions subject to significant change 
our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretation 
events beyond our control could result in business interruption or other adverse effects on our operations and growth 
our business or operations could be subject to interruption or damage due to inclement weather  natural disaster  power loss  acts of violence  terrorist attacks  war or similar events 
such events could impair our customers access to our business  impact our ability to expand or continue our operations or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
a decrease in demand for our products and specialty financial services and our failure to adapt to such decrease could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on us 
although our products and services are a staple of our customer base  the demand for a particular product or service may decrease due to a variety of factors  such as regulatory restrictions that reduce customer access to particular products  the availability of competing products or changes in customers financial conditions 
should we fail to adapt to a significant change in our customers demand for  or access to  our products  our revenues could decrease significantly 
even if we make adaptations or introduce new products to fulfill customer demand  customers may resist or may reject products whose adaptations make them less attractive or less available 
in any event  the effect of any product change on the results of our business may not be fully ascertainable until the change has been in effect for some time 
in particular  we have changed  and will continue to change  some of our consumer loan operations and the products we offer 
any of these events could result in a loss of revenue and could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospectus  results of operations and financial condition 
our mexican payroll withholding business is highly dependent on the relationships that we build and sustain with state and local governments and labor unions 
grupo finmart and its brokers promote our payroll loan products through public sector employers in governmental agencies across mexico 
if we are not able to maintain relationships with these entities or increase our distribution network through new relationships with other federal  state and local governments or labor unions  our ability to originate new payroll loans could be diminished  which would reduce the size of our payroll withholding lending loan portfolio 
in addition  despite contractual arrangements which provide that the payroll counterparty will continue to deduct payments even if our relationship with that entity is terminated  the credit risk of our existing payroll loan portfolio could increase because payroll deduction payments on existing payroll loans could be disrupted  whether due to our severing a relationship with a broker or otherwise 
goodwill comprises a significant portion of our total assets 
we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually  which could result in a material  non cash write down and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions 
the carrying value of our goodwill was million  or approximately of our total assets  as of september   over million of which is attributable to our two online lending businesses 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc asc  goodwill subsequent measurement  we test goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life for potential impairment annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  a change in strategic direction  legal factors  operating performance indicators  a change in the competitive environment  the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  or future economic factors such as unfavorable changes in the estimated future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter utilizing the income approach 
this approach uses future cash flows and estimated terminal values for each of our reporting units discounted using a market participant perspective to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  which is then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if there is an impairment 
the income approach includes assumptions about revenue growth rates  operating margins and terminal growth rates discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital derived from other publicly traded companies that are similar but not identical from an operational and economic standpoint 
we completed our annual assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of september  and determined that no material impairment existed at that date 

table of contents if our estimates of allowance for loan losses are not adequate to absorb losses  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses for estimated probable losses on company funded loans and loans in default 
see part ii item management discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates for factors considered by management in estimating the allowance for loan losses 
we also maintain a reserve for loan losses for estimated probable losses on loans funded by our credit services organization cso partners  but for which we are responsible 
as september   our aggregate reserve and allowance for losses on loans not in default including loans funded by our cso partners was million 
this reserve  however  is an estimate  and if actual losses are greater than our reserve and allowance  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the amount of reserves and allowances is based based on our current assessment of and expectations concerning various factors affecting the quality of our loan portfolio 
these factors include  among other things  our borrowers financial condition  repayment abilities and repayment intentions 
judicial decisions  cfpb rule making or amendments to the federal arbitration act could render the arbitration agreements we use illegal or unenforceable 
we include arbitration provisions in our consumer loan agreements 
these provisions are designed to allow us to resolve any customer disputes through individual arbitration rather than in court and explicitly provide that all arbitrations will be conducted on an individual and not on a class basis 
thus  our arbitration agreements  if enforced  have the effect of shielding us from class action liability 
our arbitration agreements do not generally have any impact on regulatory enforcement proceedings 
we take the position that the arbitration provisions in our consumer loan agreements  including class action waivers  are valid and enforceable 
however  the enforceability of arbitration provisions is often challenged in court 
if those challenges are successful  our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be unenforceable  which could subject us to additional litigation  including class action litigation 
in addition  the us congress has considered legislation that would generally limit or prohibit mandatory arbitration agreements in consumer contracts and has enacted legislation with such a prohibition with respect to certain mortgage loan agreements and certain consumer loan agreements to members of the military on active duty and their dependents 
further  the dodd frank act directs the cfpb to study consumer arbitration and report to the us congress  and it authorized the cfpb to adopt rules limiting or prohibiting consumer arbitration  consistent with the results of its study 
any such rule would apply to arbitration agreements entered into more than six months after the final rule becomes effective and not to prior arbitration agreements 
any judicial decision  legislation or other rules or regulations that impair our ability to enter into and enforce consumer arbitration agreements and class action waivers could significantly increase our exposure to class action litigation as well as litigation in plaintiff friendly jurisdictions 
such litigation would be costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may be exposed to liabilities under applicable anti corruption laws  and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to various anti corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business 
we have business in countries and regions that are less developed and are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments 
our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti corruption laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa 
we have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these practices by our employees and agents 
however  our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective  and our employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible 
if employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions  we may be subject to regulatory sanctions 
violations of the fcpa or other anti corruption laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties  and we may be subject to other liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition
