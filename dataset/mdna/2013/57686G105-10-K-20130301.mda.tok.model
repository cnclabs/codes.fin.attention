for accounting purposes  matson is the successor company to the former parent company 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  upon which the md a is based  requires that management exercise judgment when making estimates and assumptions about future events that may affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty and actual results will  inevitably  differ from those critical accounting estimates 
these differences could be material 
the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if i a the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made  b changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur in periods after the period in which the estimate was made  or c use of different estimates by the company could have been used  and ii changes in those assumptions or estimates would have had a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
the critical accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements are described below 
impairment of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets the company s long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  are reviewed for possible impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in such an evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset are compared with the amount recorded for the asset to determine if its carrying value is not recoverable 
if this review determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  the 
table of contents amount recorded for the asset is reduced to estimated fair value 
the company has evaluated certain long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment 
during the company determined that it had an impairment related to intangible assets at logistics 
the company recorded impairment expense of million for  which is included in operating expense on the consolidated statement of income and comprehensive income 
no impairment charges were recorded in  and these asset impairment analyses are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among others  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets  and thus  the accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  the company s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted 
impairment of investments the company s investment in its terminal joint venture is reviewed for impairment annually and whenever there is evidence that fair value may be below carrying cost 
an investment is written down to fair value if fair value is below carrying cost and the impairment is other than temporary 
in evaluating the fair value of an investment and whether any identified impairment is other than temporary  significant estimates and considerable judgments are involved 
these estimates and judgments are based  in part  on the company s current and future evaluation of economic conditions in general  as well as a joint venture s current and future plans 
additionally  these impairment calculations are highly subjective because they also require management to make assumptions and apply judgments to estimates regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows  probabilities related to various cash flow scenarios  and appropriate discount rates based on the perceived risks  among others 
in evaluating whether an impairment is other than temporary  the company considers all available information  including the length of time and extent of the impairment  the financial condition and near term prospects of the affiliate  the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and projected industry and economic trends  among others 
changes in these and other assumptions could affect the projected operational results and fair value of the unconsolidated joint venture  and accordingly  may require valuation adjustments to the company s investment that may materially impact the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
for example  if current market conditions deteriorate significantly or a joint venture s plans change materially  impairment charges may be required in future periods  and those charges could be material 
the company has evaluated its investment in ssat for impairment and no impairment charges were recorded in  and as a result of this process 
impairment of vessels the company operates an integrated network of vessels  containers  and terminal equipment  therefore  in evaluating impairment  the company groups its assets at the ocean transportation entity level  which represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are available 
the company s vessels and equipment are reviewed for possible impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances  such as recurring operating losses  indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset group are compared with the amount recorded for the asset group to determine if its carrying value is not recoverable 
if this review determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  the amount recorded for the asset group is reduced to estimated fair value 
these asset impairment loss analyses are highly subjective because they require management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgments to  among other things  estimates of the timing and amount of future cash flows  expected useful lives of the assets  uncertainty about future events  including changes in economic conditions  changes in operating performance  changes in the use of the assets  and ongoing costs of maintenance and improvements of the assets  and thus  the accounting estimates may change from period to period 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  the company s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted 
the company has not recorded any impairment related to its vessels for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents additional information about the company s vessels as of december  is as follows gross book value net book value purchase as of as of date december  december  maunalei september manulani june maunawili september manukai september rj pfeiffer august mokihana january manoa january kauai september mahimahi january maui june waialeale november haleakala december lurline august matsonia october mauna kea august mauna loa december lihue january total vessels legal contingencies the company s results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company  including  but not limited to  liability claims  antitrust claims  and claims related to coastwise trading matters 
the company records accruals for legal matters when the information available indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
management makes adjustments to these accruals to reflect the impact and status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of counsel and other information and events that may pertain to a particular matter 
predicting the outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating related costs and exposure involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from those estimates 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  the company considers many factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the nature of specific claims including unasserted claims  the company s experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed  input from outside legal counsel  the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and the matter s current status 
a detailed discussion of significant litigation matters is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
self insured liabilities the company is self insured for certain losses including  but not limited to  employee health  workers compensation  general liability  real and personal property 
where feasible  the company obtains third party excess insurance coverage to limit its exposure to these claims 
when estimating its self insured liabilities  the company considers a number of factors  including historical claims experience  demographic factors  current trends  and analyses provided by independent third parties 
periodically  management reviews its assumptions and the analyses provided by independent third parties to determine the adequacy of the company s self insured liabilities 
the company s self insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to apply judgment and make long term assumptions to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred  but not reported  as of the balance sheet date 
if management uses different assumptions or if different conditions occur in future periods  the company s financial condition or its future operating results could be materially impacted 
goodwill the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit  the company uses a combination of a discounted cash flow model and fair value based on market multiples of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the discounted cash flow approach requires the company to use a number of assumptions  including market factors specific to the business  the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows to be generated by the business over an extended period of time  long term growth rates for the business  and a discount rate that considers the risks related to the amount and timing of the cash flows 
although the assumptions used by the company in its discounted cash flow model are consistent with the assumptions the company used to generate its internal strategic plans and forecasts  significant judgment is required to estimate the amount and timing of future cash flows from the reporting unit and the risk of achieving those cash flows 
when using market multiples of ebitda  the company must make judgments about the comparability of those multiples in closed and proposed transactions 
accordingly  
table of contents changes in assumptions and estimates  including  but not limited to  changes driven by external factors  such as industry and economic trends  and those driven by internal factors  such as changes in the company s business strategy and its internal forecasts  could have a material effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has not recorded any impairment related to its goodwill for the years ended december   and  respectively 
pension and post retirement estimates the estimation of the company s pension and post retirement benefit expenses and liabilities requires that the company make various assumptions 
these assumptions include the following factors discount rates expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets salary growth health care cost trend rates inflation retirement rates mortality rates expected contributions actual results that differ from the assumptions made with respect to the above factors could materially affect the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
the effects of changing assumptions are included in unamortized net gains and losses  which directly affect accumulated other comprehensive income 
additionally  these unamortized gains and losses are amortized and reclassified to income loss over future periods 
the net periodic costs for qualified pension and post retirement plans were determined using discount rates of percent and percent  respectively 
the benefit obligations for qualified pension and post retirement benefit plans  as of december   were determined using discount rates of percent and percent  respectively 
for the company s non qualified pension plans  the net periodic cost was determined using a discount rate of percent and the december  obligation was determined using a discount rate of percent 
the discount rate used for determining the year end benefit obligation was generally calculated using a weighting of expected benefit payments and rates associated with high quality us corporate bonds for each year of expected payment to derive a single estimated rate at which the benefits could be effectively settled at december  the expected return on plan assets of percent was based on historical trends combined with long term expectations  the mix of plan assets  asset class returns  and long term inflation assumptions 
one  three  and five year pension returns losses were percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
the company s long term rate of return since inception in was percent 
as of december   the company s post retirement obligations were measured using an initial percent health care cost trend rate  decreasing by percent annually until the ultimate rate of percent is reached in lowering the expected long term rate of return on the company s qualified pension plan assets by one half of one percent would have increased pre tax pension expense for by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumption by one half of one percentage point would have increased pre tax pension expense for the qualified pension plans by approximately million 
additional information about the company s benefit plans is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the market value of the company s qualified defined benefit pension plan assets totaled approximately million  compared with million as of december  the recorded net pension liability was approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of december  the company expects to make contributions totaling million to its qualified defined benefit pension plans in the company s contributions to these qualified pension plans were approximately million in  million in and million in 
table of contents income taxes the company makes certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits and deductions  and in the calculation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to the company s tax provision in a subsequent period 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken with respect to the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could materially affect the company s financial condition or its future operating results 
accounting standards updates accounting standards updates effective after december   are not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of matson  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto

the reasons for the operating revenue changes are described below  by business segment  in the analysis of operating revenue and income by segment 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or percent  compared to the year ended december  the increase was due to a million increase in costs for the ocean transportation segment  which is inclusive of million in separation costs  offset by a reduction of cost in logistics of million 
the reasons for the operating expense changes are described below  by business segment  in the analysis of operating revenue and income by segment 
income tax expense during the year ended december  was percent of income from continuing operations before income tax as compared to percent in and increased by million compared with the year ended december  due principally to certain non recurring and non deductible separation related transaction costs and the re measurement of uncertain tax positions in as required as part of the separation tax accounting treatment 

table of contents the fourth quarter tax rate was less than the tax rates for each of the preceding quarters in for the following two reasons 
first  the company recorded a tax provision benefit in the fourth quarter for re valuation of deferred state tax liabilities caused by a reduction in the company s california income apportionment factors under the state s single sales factor apportionment requirement  which became mandatory as a result of new legislation in the fourth quarter second  the company recorded a tax provision benefit in the fourth quarter for a reduction of certain unrecognized tax benefit reserves caused by lapses in the statute of limitations for certain periods and jurisdictions in the fourth quarter loss from discontinued operations during the year ended december  decreased million 
due to the separation on june   matson has restated the operations for the six and twelve months ended june  and december   respectively  from a b as discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  decreased primarily due to the reduction in losses related to the shutdown of clx offset by the increase in net loss recorded by a b and the recognition of additional tax expense related to the separation 
the change from net income to a net loss for a b was due to an increase in consolidated operating costs and expenses  impairments of properties and a real estate joint venture recognized in the second quarter of  and other expenses  which more than offset increases in a b s consolidated operating revenue and a decrease in taxes

ocean transportation revenue increased million  or percent  in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase was due principally to significantly higher volume in the guam trade that resulted from the exit of a major competitor in that trade in late  an increase in china freight rates and increased fuel surcharges resulting from higher fuel prices  partially offset by reduced volumes in the hawaii trade 
container and automobile volume decreased in the hawaii trade in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  hawaii container volume decreased percent due to market weakness  competitive pressures  and a modest market contraction resulting from direct foreign sourcing of cargo  hawaii automobile volume decreased percent due primarily to the timing of automobile rental fleet replacement 
container volume in the china and guam trades increased during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  china container volume increased percent due to increased demand and a shift in direct foreign sourcing of cargo destined to hawaii  guam volume was substantially higher  increasing percent in the year due to gains related to the departure of a major competitor from the trade in mid november ocean transportation operating income increased million  or percent  in the year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the increase in operating income was principally due to higher volume in the guam trade and increased freight rates and volume in the china trade  partially offset by decreased volume in hawaii  increased costs related to vessel and barge dry docking and higher outside transportation costs

business outlook the business outlook provides the company s views on current conditions and trends in the various markets it serves  recent company performance and its near term prospects 
the following information updates the company s quarterly filings made by the former parent company and the company throughout all forward looking statements made herein are qualified by the inherent risks of the company s operations and the markets it serves  as more fully described in item a of this filing 
the company serves multiple domestic and international transportation markets and its operations are therefore impacted by regional  national and international economic conditions 
given its large operational presence in hawaii  the company s volumes in the hawaii trade are highly dependent on the future results of the overall hawaii economy  competitive activity related to capacity and pricing  and to specific economic sub categories including construction 
in the china trade  volume is driven primarily by us consumer demand for manufactured goods around key retail selling seasons while freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply demand balances 
as a result  this trade has historically experienced significant volatility and seasonality in freight rates 
currently  there is a global surplus of container vessel capacity and a recent market survey conducted by alphaliner estimates that a record million teus of new vessel capacity will be delivered in while excess vessel capacity has recently been mitigated through vessel lay ups and slow steaming  resulting in higher than expected freight rates  sustaining current transpacific rates depends primarily upon rational carrier management of industry capacity 
in the guam trade  the competitive environment has historically impacted financial results  and to a lesser degree  overall market volume 
currently  the company is the sole carrier of containerized freight from the west coast of the us to guam following the departure of its major competitor from the trade lane in mid november of all trade lanes typically experience seasonality in volume and generally follow a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter  with subsequent weakening of demand thereafter in the fourth and first quarters 
as a result  earnings tend to follow a similar pattern  offset by periodic vessel dry docking and other episodic cost factors  which can lead to earnings variability 
ocean transportation ocean transportation s performance is significantly influenced by freight volumes  freight rates  operating costs  and other factors  which continue to be highly dependent on general economic conditions  the future results of the overall hawaii economy  and also specific economic sub categories such as construction activity in hawaii  fuel prices  transpacific freight rates  the competitive environments in hawaii  guam and china  and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 

table of contents ocean transportation in the fourth quarter and throughout  hawaii container and auto volume was adversely impacted by subdued construction activity  competitive rate pressures  a modest market contraction resulting from direct foreign sourcing of cargo and the timing of automobile rental fleet replacements 
however  there have been encouraging indications that the hawaii economy is reviving  evidenced by strong fourth quarter consumer spending and a marginal uptick in construction activity late in the year 
therefore  modest volume gains are expected in the hawaii trade in further  and as noted above  hawaii volume can be significantly impacted by competitive activity related to pricing and capacity 
pasha hawaii transport  currently operating a single ro ro vessel in the hawaii trade lane  has announced that it intends to complete the construction of a second ship a combination roll on roll off container ship  ro con for its hawaii service as early as the extent of this market entry  in terms of sailing frequency  service reliability  slot availability  cargo configuration and service differentiation  is unknown 
however  there may be a period of competitive disruption following this market entry that could potentially negatively impact the volume for all carriers in the hawaii trade  including matson 
any adverse impact may be offset  to some degree  by general market growth in and beyond 
in the china trade  freight rates in the fourth quarter of continued to be higher than year earlier periods  reflecting an improved general rate environment 
however  additional capacity is expected to enter this market in that will outstrip demand 
while continued carrier restraint is expected to some degree  average annual freight rates are expected to erode modestly for matson 
further  the company expects to run its ships at less than full capacity during the traditional slack season but return to historical high utilization levels for the balance of during the fourth quarter and throughout  the company benefitted significantly from strong volume in its guam trade  which resulted from the departure of a major competitor the prior year 
the timing and probability of a new competitor entering this market is unknown  however  overall market volume growth and economic growth in guam during was muted 
slow  if any  overall growth in guam is expected to continue in  and therefore  matson s volumes in are expected to be relatively flat compared to levels 
results for ssat  the company s terminal operations joint venture  were negatively affected throughout by significantly reduced lift volume due to customer losses 
this customer attrition is expected to negatively impact results throughout and it is therefore expected that ssat will operate at a breakeven level 
in addition to the trade lane outlook  the company expects to benefit from operating a nine ship fleet for most of and lower outside transportation costs  both of which result from a lighter drydock schedule 
overall  operating income in the ocean transportation segment is therefore expected to improve modestly from levels 
logistics in the fourth quarter and throughout  volume and pricing in logistics intermodal and highway businesses were mixed 
in the fourth quarter  the segment incurred significant one time  non cash losses associated with its northern california warehousing operation  which resulted from consolidating warehouse space and recognizing the impairment of an intangible asset 
as a result  logistics performance was below long term expectations 
in response  the company has taken cost cutting measures to lower logistics general and corporate overhead and initiated the roll out of a domestic foot container pilot program to improve profitability 
warehouse operations are expected to improve as a result of the consolidation 
therefore  logistics is expected to improve its operating income margins to percent of revenues in and overall operating income is expected to return to a level similar to this performance will be dependent upon continuing improvement at logistics northern california warehouse operations  continued oversight of expenses  improvement in the us mainland economy  as well as competitive dynamics  cargo mix  available capacity in the market  reliability of the underlying carriers and other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 

table of contents the company s overall outlook assumes modest growth for the us and hawaii economies 
there are two primary sources of periodic economic forecasts and data for the state of hawaii the university of hawaii economic research organization uhero and the state s department of business  economic development and tourism dbedt 
economic information included herein has been derived from economic reports available on uhero s and dbedt s websites that provide more complete information about the status of and forecast for the hawaii economy 
other the company expects capital expenditures for the first quarter of to be approximately million and capital expenditures for the year to be million  excluding vessel replacement expenditures 
the company may elect to make deposits to the capital construction fund in if it is able to finalize the next phase of its vessel replacement plan that calls for two new vessels in the next three to five years 
these deposits could be significant  and the amounts deposited will be determined based on a number of factors  including company cash requirements 
any deposits made in will have the effect of reducing the company s current cash tax liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk matson is exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its borrowing and investing activities used to maintain liquidity and to fund business operations 
in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  matson utilizes a balanced mix of both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of matson s long term and short term debt can be expected to fluctuate as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the company s fixed rate debt consists of million in principal term notes 
the company s variable rate debt consists of million under its revolving credit facilities 
other than in default  the company does not have an obligation to prepay its fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate fluctuations and the resulting changes in fair value would not have an impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations unless the company was required to refinance such debt 
for the company s variable rate debt  a one percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the following table summarizes matson s debt obligations at december   presenting principal cash flows and related interest rates by the expected fiscal year of repayment 
expected fiscal year of repayment as of december  dollars in m illions fair value at thereafter total december  fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate estimated interest rates on variable debt are determined based on the rate in effect on december  actual interest rates may be greater or less than the amounts indicated when variable rate debt is rolled over 
from time to time  the company may invest its excess cash in short term money market funds that purchase government securities or corporate debt securities 
at december   the company did not have any investments in money market funds 
these money market funds maintain a weighted average maturity of less than days  and accordingly  a one percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on the fair value of these investments or on interest income 
through its capital construction fund  the company may  from time to time  invest in mortgage backed securities 
at december  and  these investments were not material 
matson has no material exposure to foreign currency risks  although it is indirectly affected by changes in currency rates to the extent that changes in rates affect tourism in hawaii 
transactions related to its china service are primarily denominated in us dollars  and therefore  a one percent change in the renminbi exchange rate would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
in  transactions related to its new south pacific service are expected to be primarily denominated in new zealand dollars  however a one percent change in the new zealand dollar exchange is not expected to have a material effect on the company s results of operations
