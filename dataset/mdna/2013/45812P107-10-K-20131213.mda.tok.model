item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs and markets high performance integrated circuits for the following key markets i automotive  ii communications  iii industrial  medical and military  and iv digital consumer 
our primary products are low and medium density dram in both package and known good die kgd form and high speed and low power sram  serial and parallel nor flash products and a variety of mixed signal and analog products 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenue was derived from our dram and sram products 
sales of our dram products have represented a majority of our revenue in each year since fiscal on september   we acquired approximately of chingis technology corporation chingis for approximately million  or million net of the approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on chingis balance sheet at closing 
in may  we acquired an additional of chingis for approximately million 
at september   we owned approximately of chingis 
founded in  chingis provides a variety of nor flash memory technologies used in standalone and embedded applications 
chingis is headquartered in hsinchu  taiwan and has offices in taiwan  korea  china and the us our financial results reflect accounting for chingis on a consolidated basis beginning september  on january   we acquired si en integration holdings limited si en  a privately held fabless provider of high performance analog and mixed signal integrated circuits headquartered in xiamen  china 
si en targets the mobile communications  digital consumer  networking  and automotive markets 
si en s current products include audio power amplifiers  led drivers  power management and temperature sensors 
in january  we formed a separate business unit  giantec semiconductor  inc giantec which designs and markets application specific standard products assp primarily eeproms and smartcards 
as part of this formation  giantec raised approximately million from an outside investor 
on december   giantec received an additional investment of million from outside investors  and as a result our ownership interest was reduced to approximately and we were required to deconsolidate giantec 
in august  we sold approximately of our shares in giantec and on august   giantec merged with maxllent corp 
thereby reducing our ownership interest in giantec to approximately 
in fiscal  we sold our remaining investment in giantec for million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
our consolidated financial statements reflect accounting for giantec on a consolidated basis from january  through december  for the period from december  through august   we accounted for giantec on the equity method and our results included our percentage share of giantec s results of operations 
from september  until the sale of our investment in june  we accounted for giantec on the cost basis 
in order to control our operating expenses  for the past several years we have limited our headcount in the us and maintained much of our operations in taiwan and china 
we believe this strategy has enabled us to limit our operating expenses while simultaneously locating these operations closer to our manufacturing partners and our customers 
as a result of these efforts  we currently have significantly more employees in asia than we do in the us we intend to continue these strategies going forward 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble and test our products 
because of our dependence on third party wafer foundries  our ability to increase our unit sales volumes depends on our ability to increase our wafer capacity allocation from current foundries  add additional foundries and improve yields of good die per wafer 
in recent years  it has become more difficult for us to secure long term foundry capacity particularly for our dram products due to industry consolidation affecting foundries and adverse financial conditions at foundries 
in this regard  in september  we invested approximately million in nanya and entered into an agreement with nanya to provide us with access to leading edge process technologies and certain wafer volume guarantees 
in addition  certain of our foundries have decided from time to time not to produce the type of wafers that we need especially certain types of dram wafers so we have been forced to rely on alternative sources of supply and to place large last time buy orders which expose us to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
once a product is in production at a particular foundry  it is time consuming and costly to have such product manufactured at a different foundry 
although such matters have not had a material adverse impact on our business or financial results in recent periods  there can be no assurance as to the future impact that such matters will have on our business  customer relationships or results of operations 
the average selling prices of our dram and sram products are sensitive to supply and demand conditions in our target markets and have generally declined over time 
we experienced declines in the average selling prices for certain of our products in fiscal and in fiscal we expect average selling prices for our products to decline in the future  principally due to market demand  market competition and the supply of competitive products in the market 
any future decreases in our average selling prices could have an adverse impact on our revenue  gross margins and operating margins 
our ability to maintain or increase revenues will be highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in average selling prices of existing 
table of contents products 
declining average selling prices will adversely affect our gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with commensurate reductions in per unit costs or changes in product mix in favor of higher margin products 
revenue from product sales to our direct customers is recognized upon shipment provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of our sales is made to distributors under agreements that provide for the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with credits that will be issued to these distributors  we defer recognition of such sales until our products are sold by the distributors to their end customers 
revenue from sales to distributors who do not have sales price rebates or product return privileges is recognized at the time our products are sold by us to the distributors 
we market and sell our products in asia  the us  europe and other locations through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
the percentage of our sales shipped outside the us was approximately  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
we measure sales location by the shipping destination 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales 
the percentages of our net sales by region are set forth in the following table fiscal years ended september  asia europe us other total our sales are generally made by purchase orders 
because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice  backlog may not be a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses 
due to the complex nature of the markets we serve and the broad fluctuations in economic conditions in the us and other countries  it is difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including economic conditions in asia  particularly taiwan and china  changes in trade policy and regulatory requirements  duties  tariffs and other trade barriers and restrictions  the burdens of complying with foreign laws and  possibly  political instability 
most of our foundries and all of our assembly and test subcontractors are located in asia 
although our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars  we do have sales transactions in new taiwan dollars  in hong kong dollars and in chinese renminbi 
in addition  we have foreign operations where expenses are generally denominated in the local currency 
such transactions expose us to the risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  but have not adopted any hedging strategies to date 
there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business and operating results in the future 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in net sales of million was primarily the result of million of nor flash revenue from our acquisition of chingis which closed on september  our dram and sram revenue increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal our dram revenue increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal principally as a result of a favorable shift in product mix to higher density products 
our sram revenue remained relatively flat in fiscal compared to fiscal as the impact of an increase in average selling prices from a shift in product mix was offset by the impact of a decrease in unit shipments 
our analog revenue decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate that the average selling prices of our existing products will generally decline over time  although the rate of decline may fluctuate for certain products 
there can be no assurance that any future price declines will be offset by higher volumes or by higher prices on newer products 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 
in fiscal  revenue from our largest distributor accounted for of net sales and revenue from our second largest distributor accounted for of our net sales 

table of contents gross profit 
cost of sales includes die cost from the wafers acquired from foundries  subcontracted package  assembly and test costs  costs associated with in house product testing  quality assurance  amortization of intangibles and import duties 
gross profit increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin was in fiscal compared to in fiscal fiscal included a million charge for inventory write downs which unfavorably impacted our gross margin by compared to a million charge for inventory write downs which unfavorably impacted our gross margin by in fiscal in addition  our gross profit for fiscal included million for the write off of certain intangible assets acquired with our acquisition of si en which unfavorably impacted our gross margin by 
excluding the impact of the inventory write downs and impairment charge  our gross margin decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal which can be attributed to the unfavorable impact in the current period of sales of lower margin nor flash products 
we believe that the average selling prices of our products will decline over time and  unless we are able to reduce our cost per unit or improve our product mix to higher gross margin products to the extent necessary to offset such declines  the decline in average selling prices will result in a material decline in our gross margin 
in addition  our product costs could increase if our suppliers raise prices  which could result in a material decline in our gross margin 
when demand for end products has increased  foundries have tended to raise wafer prices 
although we have product cost reduction programs in place that involve efforts to reduce internal costs and supplier costs  there can be no assurance that product costs will be reduced or that such reductions will be sufficient to offset the expected declines in average selling prices 
we do not believe that such cost reduction efforts are likely to have a material adverse impact on the quality of our products or the level of service provided by us 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of million was primarily the result of a million increase in research and development expenses for our nor flash products as a result of our acquisition of chingis 
in addition  our research and development expenses in fiscal increased by million primarily related to headcount and other product development expenses compared to fiscal fiscal included a million impairment charge for certain intangible and tangible assets acquired with our acquisition of si en 
we expect the dollar amount of our research and development expenses to increase in fiscal and expect such expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales depending on our overall level of sales 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses can be attributed to a million increase in expenses as a result of our acquisition of chingis 
in addition  our selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased by million primarily related to headcount related expenses  professional service fees and sales commissions compared to fiscal fiscal included a million impairment charge and million in amortization of certain intangible assets from our acquisition of si en which were written off in the september quarter 
we expect the dollar amount of our selling  general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in fiscal and expect such expenses to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales depending on our overall level of sales 
impairment of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed the first step of our annual goodwill impairment test  which included examining the impact of current general economic conditions on our future prospects and the current level of our market capitalization 
based on this analysis  we concluded that goodwill related to our analog reporting unit was impaired 
our analog reporting unit goodwill was originally recorded in connection with our acquisition of si en 
therefore  we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
specifically  we hypothetically allocated the estimated fair value of our equity as determined in the first step to recognized and unrecognized net assets  including allocations to intangible assets 
the analysis indicated that there would be approximately million remaining implied value attributable to goodwill and accordingly  we wrote off million of our goodwill 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net was income of million in fiscal compared to expense of million in fiscal the million of interest and other income in fiscal was comprised of million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility  interest income of million and foreign exchange gains of approximately million offset in part by million of other items 
the million of interest of other income expense in fiscal was comprised of a million charge to write down our investment in semiconductor manufacturing international corporation smic due to the decline in fair market value being considered other than temporary  foreign exchange losses of approximately million  other expenses of approximately million offset in part by million in rental income from the lease of excess space in our taiwan facility and million of interest income 
gain on the sale of investments 
in fiscal  we sold approximately million shares of nanya common stock for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
in addition  we sold our investment in giantec for approximately million which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million 

table of contents provision for income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal that represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
in fiscal  we recorded an increase in the valuation allowance of approximately million for california net operating loss carryforwards and a decrease in the valuation allowance of approximately million for foreign tax credit carryforwards based on our estimated ability to use these carryforwards in the future as a result of a change in our legal structure 
the difference between the recorded provision for income taxes and the tax provision  based on the federal statutory rate of  was primarily attributable to the impact of such items  the differential in foreign tax rates  significant foreign inclusions and non deductible stock based compensation expense 
we recorded income tax expense of million for fiscal that is principally comprised of us federal  state and foreign income taxes 
the difference between the million tax expense and the tax on income based on the federal statutory rate of is principally due to the impact of non deductible foreign impairment charges  foreign losses for which no tax benefit has been recorded  non deductible stock based compensation charges and other valuation allowance adjustments 
for fiscal  we continued to record a valuation allowance on certain us and foreign deferred tax assets where the estimated realization is not certain 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in net sales of million was principally due to a decrease in assp  analog and sram revenue partially offset by an increase in dram revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal our dram revenue increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal principally as a result of a favorable shift in product mix whereas our sram revenue decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of a decrease in unit shipments and average selling prices 
fiscal included million of analog revenue compared to million in fiscal the decrease in analog revenue was the result of a decrease in unit shipments as the china feature phone market weakened due to the shift toward smart phones

fiscal included a million charge for inventory write downs which unfavorably impacted our gross margin by compared to a million charge for inventory write downs which unfavorably impacted our gross margin by in fiscal excluding the impact of the impairment charge and inventory write downs  our gross margin increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the favorable impact in the current period of a change in product mix as well as a decrease in product costs for certain products 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses of million can be partially attributed to a million impairment charge in fiscal for certain intangible and tangible assets acquired with our acquisition of si en 
in addition  million of the increase in our research and development expenses is the result of consolidating si en for all of fiscal and additional analog product development expenses 
our acquisition of chingis in september resulted in an increase of million in research and development expenses

the gain on the sale of investments was million in fiscal as we sold an investment and recorded a corresponding pre tax gain 
provision benefit for income taxes

the difference between the million tax expense and the tax on income based on the federal statutory rate of is principally due to the impact of non deductible foreign impairment charges  foreign losses for which no tax benefit has been recorded  non deductible stock based compensation charges and other valuation allowance adjustments 
for fiscal  we continued to record a valuation allowance on certain us and foreign deferred tax assets where the estimated realization is not certain 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal the income tax benefit was due to the release of valuation allowances for federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of approximately million offset by the income tax provision of million of foreign taxes on certain income earned by our foreign entities and some miscellaneous state income taxes 
the release of the valuation allowance in fiscal was based on our evaluation of historical evidence  trends in profitability and expectations of future taxable income 
as such  we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary for the majority of our us and for certain foreign deferred tax assets because  based on the available evidence  realization of these net deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
a valuation allowance remained on certain u

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
the net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million

our sources of financing for fiscal were proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million from stock option exercises and sales under our employee stock purchase plan and borrowings of million under short term lines of credit 
in fiscal  we used million for the repayment of short term borrowings and million to settle shares withheld for statutory requirements upon the vesting of rsus 
we have million in borrowings available through a number of short term lines of credit with various financial institutions in taiwan 
these lines of credit expire at various times through august as of september   we had no outstanding borrowings under these short term lines of credit 
on december   we purchased a building in milpitas  california consisting of  square feet on approximately acres for million 
we relocated our headquarters to this location in june we financed a portion of the purchase price for our new headquarters with a loan for approximately million 
in taiwan  we own and occupy our building and the land upon which our building is situated is leased under an operating lease that expires in march we have operations in leased sites in china and hong kong 
in addition to these sites  we lease sales offices in the us  europe and asia 
these leases expire at various dates through our outstanding commitments under these leases were approximately million at september  we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of months 
liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to the replacement of defective items or return of amounts paid 
warranty expense has historically been immaterial to our financial statements 
our contractual cash obligations at september  are outlined in the table below payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations with wafer foundries total contractual cash obligations at september   we had outstanding authorization from our board to purchase up to million of our common stock from time to time 
we believe our existing funds will satisfy our anticipated working capital and other cash requirements through at least the next months 
we may from time to time take actions to further increase our cash position through equity or debt financings  sales of shares of investments  additional bank borrowings  or the disposition of certain assets 
from time to time  we may also commit to acquisitions or equity investments  including strategic investments in or prepayments to wafer fabrication foundries or assembly and test subcontractors 
to the extent we enter into such transactions  any such transaction could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing to fund such activities 
there can be no assurance that any such additional financing could be obtained on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we may be obligated to indemnify certain customers  distributors  suppliers  and subcontractors for attorney fees and damages and costs awarded against these parties in certain circumstances in which our products are alleged to infringe third party intellectual property rights  including patents  registered trademarks  or copyrights 
in certain cases  there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
in addition  we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  and the company s bylaws provide that indemnification may be provided to our agents 
we have directors and officers insurance pursuant to which we may be reimbursed for certain indemnity expenses  subject to the terms of the insurance policy 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future indemnity expenses that we may be required to make 
the amount of available directors and officers insurance may not be sufficient to cover our indemnity obligations  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in future periods 
other than as set forth above  we are not currently party to any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make difficult and subjective estimates  judgments and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience combined with knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future  considering the information available at the time 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
we reevaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
our critical accounting policies which are impacted by our estimates are i the valuation of our inventory  which impacts cost of goods sold and gross profit  ii the valuation of our allowance for sales returns and allowances  which impacts net sales  iii the valuation of our allowance for doubtful accounts  which impacts general and administrative expense  iv accounting for acquisitions and goodwill  which impacts cost of goods sold and operating expense when we record impairments  v accounting for stock based compensation which impacts costs of goods sold  research and development expense and selling  general and administrative expense and vi accounting for income taxes 
each of these policies is described in more detail below 
we also have other key accounting policies that may not require us to make estimates and judgments that are as subjective or difficult 
for instance  our policies with regard to revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to distributors with sales price rebates and product return privileges 
these policies are described in the notes to our financial statements contained elsewhere in this report on form k 
valuation of inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
determining the market value of inventories on hand and at distributors as of the balance sheet date involves numerous judgments  including projecting average selling prices and sales volumes for future periods and costs to complete products in work in process inventories 
when market values are below our costs  we record a charge to cost of goods sold to write down our inventories to their estimated market value in advance of when the inventories are actually sold 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that may adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when the written down products are sold 
in addition to lower of cost or market write downs  we also analyze inventory to determine whether any of it is excess  obsolete or defective 
we write down to zero dollars which is a charge to cost of goods sold the carrying value of inventory on hand that has aged over one year two years for wafer and die bank to cover estimated excess and obsolete exposures  unless adjustments are made based on management s judgments for newer products  end of life products  planned inventory increases or strategic customer supply 
in making such judgments to write down inventory  we take into account the product life cycles which can range from six to months  the stage in the life cycle of the product  and the impact of competitors announcements and product introductions on our products 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent 
valuation of allowance for sales returns and allowances 
net sales consist principally of total product sales less estimated sales returns and allowances 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns and allowances 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the allowance are recorded as a reduction to net sales 
because the allowance for sales returns and allowances is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our allowances may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our allowances are not adequate  our net sales could be adversely affected 

table of contents valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments for goods and services purchased from us 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
once an account is deemed unlikely to be fully collected  we write down the carrying value of the receivable to the estimated recoverable value  which results in a charge to general and administrative expense  which decreases our profitability 
accounting for acquisitions and goodwill 
we account for acquisitions using the purchase accounting method 
under this method  the total consideration paid is allocated over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including in process research and development  with any excess allocated to goodwill 
goodwill is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value allocated to the net assets 
our judgments as to the fair value of the assets will  therefore  affect the amount of goodwill that we record 
management is responsible for the valuation of tangible and intangible assets 
for tangible assets acquired in any acquisition  such as plant and equipment  the useful lives are estimated by considering comparable lives of similar assets  past history  the intended use of the assets and their condition 
in estimating the useful life of the acquired intangible assets with definite lives  we consider the industry environment and unique factors relating to each product relative to our business strategy and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
acquired intangible assets primarily include developed and in process technology ipr d  customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements 
the amounts allocated to ipr d projects are not expensed until technological feasibility is reached for each project 
upon completion of development for each project  the acquired ipr d will be amortized over its useful life 
we are currently amortizing our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods generally ranging from three to six years 
we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances where indicators of impairment may exist 
for instance  in response to changes in industry and market conditions  we could be required to strategically realign our resources and consider restructuring  disposing of  or otherwise exiting businesses  which could result in an impairment of tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill 
in this regard  in fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million for intangible assets and goodwill from our acquisition of si en and million for the impairment of certain tangible assets 
accounting for stock based compensation 
stock option fair value is calculated on the date of grant using the black scholes valuation model 
the compensation cost is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is generally the option vesting term of four years 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to estimate key assumptions such as expected term  volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rates that determine the stock option fair value 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant 
in subsequent periods  if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate  the forfeiture rate may be revised 
we estimate our expected forfeitures rate based on our historical activity and judgment regarding trends 
we estimate the expected term for option grants based upon historical exercise data 
if we determined that another method used to estimate expected life was more reasonable than our current method  or if another method for calculating these input assumptions was prescribed by authoritative guidance  the fair value calculated could change materially 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability approach 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider historical levels of income  projections of future income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income  and ongoing prudent and practical tax planning strategies 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we would increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us and foreign taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and foreign countries  and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in certain of these jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax return positions are fully supported  but tax authorities may challenge certain positions  which may not be fully sustained 
our income tax expense includes amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges 
determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities requires management judgment and estimates 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions and believe that our provision for uncertain tax positions  including related interest and penalties  is adequate based on information currently available to us 
however  the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision  net income and cash flows 
our overall tax provision requirement could change due to the issuance of new regulations or new case law  management judgments on undistributed foreign earnings including judgments about and intentions concerning our future operations  negotiations with tax authorities  resolution with respect to individual audit issues  or the entire audit  or the expiration of statutes of limitations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated revenue 
our international sales are largely denominated in us dollars and therefore are not subject to material foreign currency exchange risk 
however  we have operations in china  europe  taiwan  hong kong  india  japan  korea and singapore where our expenses are denominated in each country s local currency and are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
in fiscal  we recorded exchange gains of approximately million  whereas in fiscal  we recorded exchange losses of approximately million 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities 
in the future  if we feel our foreign currency exposure has significantly increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at september  these funds were primarily invested in money market funds and certificates of deposit 
due to the relatively short term nature of our investment portfolio  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
we believe a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
since we believe we have the ability to liquidate this portfolio  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio
