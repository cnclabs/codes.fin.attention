item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under the caption entitled item selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this form k 
our fiscal year ends on september and unless otherwise noted  references to years refer to our fiscal year rather than a calendar year 
overview consolidation and segments 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of headwaters  all of our subsidiaries  and other entities in which we have a controlling interest 
all significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we currently operate primarily in two construction oriented business segments light building products and heavy construction materials  and have several product lines within those segments 
our construction oriented end markets include new residential  residential repair and remodeling  commercial  institutional and infrastructure 
our third non core operating segment is in energy technology 
operations and strategy 
in the light building products segment  we design  manufacture  and sell manufactured architectural stone  exterior siding accessories such as shutters  mounting blocks  and vents  concrete block and other building products 
we manufacture our light building products in approximately locations 
revenues consist of product sales to wholesale and retail distributors  contractors and other users of building products 
a restructuring effort in the light building products segment was initiated in and completed in march in  we acquired the assets of kleer lumber  inc  a manufacturer of pvc trim board and moulding products 

table of contents our heavy construction materials business acquires fly ash from coal fueled electric generating utilities 
using a nationwide storage and distribution network  the fly ash  which is used as an admixture for the partial replacement of portland cement in concrete  is sold directly to concrete manufacturers 
in addition to fly ash and other coal combustion products ccp sales  revenues also include ccp disposal services provided to utilities 
the energy technology segment has been focused on reducing waste and increasing the value of energy related feedstocks  primarily in the areas of low value coal and oil 
in the past  revenues for the energy technology segment consisted primarily of coal sales  however  in september we committed to a plan to sell our coal cleaning business and since then the coal cleaning business has been presented as a discontinued operation 
in january  we sold all of our remaining coal cleaning facilities and continuing revenues for the energy technology segment currently consist primarily of catalyst sales to oil refineries 
light building products segment 
for several years  our light building products segment has been significantly affected by the depressed new housing and residential remodeling markets 
accordingly  we significantly reduced operating costs to be positively positioned to take advantage of an anticipated industry turnaround 
although new housing construction continues to be substantially below the median for the last years  there has been improvement in end markets recently 
demand for new homes is rising  although there is still an environment characterized by tight credit conditions which constrain new building and purchases 
nevertheless  new residential construction starts improved somewhat over the prior year and as of august are at a seasonally adjusted annualized level of approximately million units 
existing home sales have also been trending up 
the national association of realtors reported that september total existing home sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of million units  compared to million units for september total housing inventory as of september  was million existing homes for sale  representing a month supply 
this compares to a month supply as of september  and a month supply in may  near the peak of the housing boom 
the median sales price for existing homes of all types in september was higher than in september we believe population growth  pent up household formation  increased builder confidence and growing rental demand are some of the factors that have resulted in positive momentum 
repair and remodel markets  however  continue to be weak 
we  like many others in the light building products industry  experienced a large drop in sales and a reduction in our margins beginning in and continuing through while mortgage and home equity loan interest rates have been low in recent years  volatility continues to exist in credit and equity markets  increased borrowing requirements prevent many potential buyers from qualifying for home mortgages and equity loans and there exists a continued lack of consumer confidence 
it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable for the long term and we can provide no assurances that improvements in our light building products markets will continue 
heavy construction materials segment 
our business strategy in the heavy construction materials industry is to negotiate long term contracts with suppliers  supported by investment in transportation and storage infrastructure for the marketing and sale of ccps 
demand for ccps is somewhat dependent on federal and state funding of infrastructure projects  which has decreased in recent years as compared to earlier periods 
we are continuing our efforts to expand the demand for high quality ccps  develop more uses for lower quality ccps  and expand our ccp disposal services and site service revenue generated from ccp management 
while all of our businesses have been affected by the recent recession  the impact on our heavy construction materials segment was somewhat less severe than on our light building products segment 
however  to the extent that coal combustion power plant units are shut down or idled in the future  our business may be adversely affected 

table of contents energy technology segment 
until january  we owned and operated coal cleaning facilities that remove impurities from waste coal  resulting in higher value  marketable coal 
in  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and decided to divest our coal cleaning business which did not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business  which has been classified as a discontinued operation since that time 
we sold one coal cleaning facility during and the remaining ten facilities in during  and  many of our coal cleaning assets were idled or produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
as a result  we recorded significant asset impairments in those years to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 
we recognized small estimated gains on the and sale transactions  and subsequent to the dates of sale  some adjustments of the previously recognized estimated gains were recognized 
we currently expect that additional adjustments to the estimated gains and losses may be recognized in as certain contingencies are resolved 
currently  continuing revenues for the energy technology segment consist primarily of catalyst sales 
in  we announced the decision by a refinery to commercially implement our hcat heavy oil upgrading technology following a lengthy evaluation and we currently expect to have additional hcat customers in future years 
we continue to invest in research and development activities  primarily focused on our catalyst technologies  but at decreased levels compared to earlier years 
through december   we participated in a joint venture that operates an ethanol plant located in north dakota 
we sold our interest in that joint venture effective january  seasonality and weather 
both our light building products and our heavy construction materials segments are greatly impacted by seasonality 
revenues  profitability and ebitda are generally highest in the june and september quarters and both segments are affected by weather to the extent it impacts construction activities 
capitalization and liquidity 
we became highly leveraged as a result of acquisitions consummated in the timeframe  but reduced our outstanding debt significantly through by using cash generated from operations  from underwritten public offerings of common stock and from proceeds from settlement of litigation 
in  we recommenced making early debt repayments as our business improved and free cash flow increased 
in and  we restructured our long term debt twice which culminated in the issuance of million of senior secured notes for net proceeds of approximately million 
we used most of those proceeds to repay in full the formerly outstanding senior secured notes 
the senior secured notes mature in april while the notes were scheduled to mature in during  we issued approximately million of convertible senior subordinated notes due in february  in exchange for cancellation of an equal amount of outstanding notes due in february using proceeds from the sale of our interest in the blue flint ethanol joint venture and other sources of cash  we also repaid million of our convertible senior subordinated notes 
during  we repaid an additional million of convertible notes and currently we have approximately million face value of convertible debt outstanding  million of which is due in february and million of which is due in february in december  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to acquire the assets of kleer lumber 
capital expenditures in through were significantly lower than in prior years  which has allowed us to focus on liquidity and the early repayment of debt and enabled us to continue implementing our overall operational strategy 
as of september   we have approximately million of cash on hand and total liquidity of approximately million 
additional cash flow is expected to be generated from operations over the next months 

table of contents in summary  our strategy for and subsequent years is to continue activities to improve operational efficiencies and reduce operating costs 
we also plan to pursue growth opportunities through targeted capital expenditures as well as potential additional strategic acquisitions of products or entities that expand our current operating platform  when opportunities arise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are identified and described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our policies and estimation procedures 
estimates are often based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  but which could change in the future 
some of our accounting policies and estimation procedures require the use of substantial judgment  and actual results could differ materially from the estimates underlying the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
such policies and estimation procedures have been reviewed with our audit committee 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets consist primarily of identifiable intangible assets obtained in connection with acquisitions 
all but one of our intangible assets are being amortized  using the straight line method  our best estimate of the pattern of economic benefit  over their estimated useful lives 
we have one indefinite lived intangible asset  a tradename which was acquired in goodwill consists of the excess of the purchase price for businesses acquired over the acquisition date fair value of identified assets  net of liabilities assumed 
in accordance with the requirements of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we do not amortize goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets 
asc topic requires us to periodically test these assets for impairment  at least annually  or sooner if indicators of possible impairment arise 
we perform our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter using a june test date and a one to three step process for goodwill  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our reporting units for purposes of testing for goodwill impairment are the same as our operating segments 
long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment only when indicators of potential impairment arise 
we evaluate  based on current events and circumstances  the carrying values of all long lived assets  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or to the estimated useful lives are required 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  or changes in our business model or capital strategy could result in actual useful lives differing from our current estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful lives of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets should be changed  we amortize the net book value in excess of salvage value over the revised remaining useful life  thereby prospectively adjusting depreciation or amortization expense as necessary 
no significant changes to estimated useful lives were made during the periods presented 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
the carrying value of a long lived asset other than goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets is considered impaired when the cumulative anticipated undiscounted cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of that asset is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is 
table of contents recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
indicators of impairment include such things as a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate  a history of operating or cash flow losses  a decline in operating performance  a significant change in competition  or an expectation that significant assets will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
material impairments of our discontinued energy segment property plant and equipment were recorded in and no material impairments of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in any year presented 
it is possible that some of our tangible or intangible long lived assets or goodwill could be impaired in the future and that any resulting write downs could be material 
property  plant and equipment as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we recorded significant asset impairments in our energy technology segment in and  all related to our discontinued coal cleaning business 
many of our coal cleaning facilities were idled or produced coal at low levels of capacity and were cash flow negative for these or other reasons 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business 
we sold one coal cleaning facility in and the remaining ten facilities in using forecasts of future cash flows and other information  including offers of interest to acquire the assets from third parties  we determined that coal cleaning asset impairments existed and recorded non cash impairment charges aggregating approximately million in and  including impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of the assets to fair value less estimated selling costs 
there were many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing expected future cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of our coal cleaning assets  including future production levels  future coal prices  whether cleaned coal would be sold in the steam or metallurgical markets  the extent to which section tax credits would be earned and utilized in future periods  future operating margins  required capital expenditures  the extent  quality and productive lives of feedstock coal refuse reserves  and the potential relocation of facilities to more favorable sites or the sale of facilities  among other considerations 
asc topic property  plant  and equipment impairment or disposal of long lived assets requires that an analysis for potential impairment be performed at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets 
for us  this meant up to ten different asset groups were required to be analyzed since two of the coal cleaning facilities were managed and operated as a single unit  each of which had many unique operating and contractual features associated with it 
asc topic also indicates that when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset group are under consideration or if a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows associated with the likely course of action  the likelihood of those possible outcomes shall be considered 
accordingly  for most operations a probability weighted approach was used in considering the likelihood of different potential outcomes 
for the and impairment tests  the assumptions included potential outcomes that all of the facilities would be sold 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of the fair value level inputs in the cash flow models utilized to estimate the impairments  including current and forecasted market prices of coal  inflation  useful lives of probable reserves  historical production levels  and offers of interest to acquire the assets from third parties 
materially different input estimates and assumptions  including the probabilities of differing potential outcomes  would have necessarily resulted in materially different calculations of expected future cash flows and asset fair values and materially different impairment estimates 
we sold one coal cleaning facility during for cash proceeds of million plus potential future consideration and an estimated gain of approximately million was recognized on that sale 
in  we sold the remaining ten facilities and again recognized an estimated gain at the time of sale 
subsequent to the dates of sale in and  some adjustments of the previously recognized estimated gains on the sales transactions were recognized  all of which have been included in the 
table of contents million loss on disposal reported for as reflected in note we currently expect that additional adjustments to the estimated gains and losses may be recognized in as certain contingencies are resolved 
for all sales transactions  a majority of the consideration is in the form of potential production royalties and deferred purchase price  which amounts are dependent upon future plant production levels over several years 
while maximum potential future production royalties and deferred purchase price on the sales transactions could total more than million  such potential proceeds were not considered in the gain or loss calculations and will be accounted for in future periods when any such amounts are received 
we currently expect to continue to recognize in discontinued operations any cash receipts or expenditures related to the former coal cleaning business that are received or paid during in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement for one of the sales transactions  the buyer of the coal cleaning facilities agreed to assume the lease and reclamation obligations related to certain of the facilities 
subsequent to the date of sale  we amended the purchase agreement to provide the buyer with additional time to make payments  as well as fulfill contractual requirements related to the assumed reclamation obligations 
the buyer continues to make progress  but as of september   we remain contingently liable for some of the assumed obligations and accrued approximately million to meet those contingent liabilities if necessary 
as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have also reserved certain receivables due from the buyer until such time as collection is more certain 
goodwill all of the goodwill recorded in our light building products segment in years prior to was written off in and previous years 
approximately million of segment goodwill existed as of september   all of which arose from small acquisitions consummated in and goodwill increased by million in as a result of the kleer lumber acquisition described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the heavy construction materials reporting unit had recorded goodwill of approximately million as of september  and  all of which related to acquisitions completed many years ago 
annual goodwill impairment tests performed subsequent to these acquisitions indicated no impairment for the heavy construction materials reporting unit for any test date  and accordingly  no impairment charges have been necessary for any period 
beginning with the june  goodwill impairment test  we adopted the new accounting rules described in note to the consolidated financial statements  whereby companies may evaluate qualitative factors  including macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors  to determine whether it is necessary to perform step of the two step goodwill impairment test 
this qualitative evaluation is commonly referred to as step we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values exceeded the carrying amounts of goodwill for both the light building products and heavy construction materials reporting units as of june  and accordingly  further step and step testing for impairment was not required to be performed 
in summary  for both reporting units  general industry trends are more positive than in recent prior years  and the overall financial performance of these reporting units improved in and again in as compared to previous years 
for the goodwill impairment tests for and prior years  in determining the fair values of the reporting units all three of the traditional valuation approaches  the income approach  the market approach and the asset based approach  were considered 
the fair values of the reporting units were calculated using the income approach  determined by discounting expected future cash flows 
this method was chosen because it specifically considers the operations  opportunities and risks applicable to the reporting units 
the market approach  specifically the guideline public company method  was also considered 
however  the reporting units direct competitors are either subsets of large corporate 
table of contents entities or are privately held 
therefore  there was limited comparability between the reporting units and the potential guideline public companies 
accordingly  the guideline public company method was utilized only as a reasonableness test for the results from the income approach 
finally  the asset based approach was also considered  however  it was not utilized because it does not consider the income producing going concern nature of the reporting units assets 
as discussed above  the fair values of the reporting units were calculated primarily using discounted expected future cash flows 
there are many estimates and assumptions involved in preparing those expected future cash flows  including most significantly the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows  anticipated long term growth rates  future profit margins  working capital requirements and required capital expenditures 
management used its best efforts to reasonably estimate all of these and other inputs in the cash flow models utilized  however  as with any such valuation process  it is probable that actual results will differ from these estimates and differences can be material 
materially different input estimates and assumptions would necessarily result in materially different calculations of discounted expected future cash flows and reporting unit fair values and materially different goodwill impairment estimates 
based on currently available information and results of operations  management currently believes the likelihood of material goodwill impairments in the near future is remote 
income taxes 
significant estimates and judgments are routinely required in the calculation of our income tax provisions 
as of september   our net deferred income tax position was near beginning in  we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our net amortizable deferred tax assets and accordingly  did not recognize benefit for tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss nol carryforwards or other deferred tax assets in  or  except to the extent of earnings 
we recorded a minimal income tax benefit in and approximately million and million of income tax expense in and  respectively 
the reported income tax rate for of near and the negative income tax rate of for were due to the combination of not recognizing benefit for pre tax losses and tax credits  but recognizing current state income taxes in certain state jurisdictions where we generated taxable income 
the reported rate for was also due primarily to the combination of recognizing benefit for deferred tax assets only to the extent of earnings plus state income taxes in certain state jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
because the realization of our deferred tax assets  most of which relate to nol and tax credit carryforwards  is dependent upon future income in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that have generated losses  management determined that we do not meet the more likely than not threshold that nols  tax credits and other deferred tax assets will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance is required 
during  we may realize a three year cumulative accounting profit 
if this occurs  we will also consider other positive and negative evidence such as current financial performance  financial and taxable income projections on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  the market environment and other factors  in evaluating the continued need for a full  or partial  valuation allowance 
in determining future taxable income  we utilize many assumptions  including amounts of federal  state and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our underlying businesses 
any reversal of the valuation allowance will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of reversal 
as of september   we had approximately million of gross unrecognized income tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the 
table of contents application of complex tax regulations in multiple tax jurisdictions and we currently have open tax years subject to examination by the irs for the years through and by other taxing authorities for the years through we recently completed an audit by the irs for which did not result in any material impact to earnings from continuing operations 
however  the completion of this audit did result in a tax benefit of approximately million in discontinued operations related to the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of future audits by the irs or any other taxing authority 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and state tax jurisdictions based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
if events occur or do not occur as expected and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when it is determined the liabilities are no longer required to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of our unrecognized income tax benefits could change significantly within the next months 
these changes could be the result of our ongoing tax audits or the settlement of outstanding audit issues 
however  due to the issues being examined  at the current time  an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made  beyond amounts currently accrued 
litigation 
we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
management does not currently believe that the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our operations  cash flow or financial position 
in accounting for legal matters  we follow the guidance in asc topic contingencies  under which loss contingencies are accounted for based upon the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability 
if a loss contingency is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  it is accrued 
if a loss contingency is probable but the amount of loss cannot be reasonably estimated  disclosure is made 
if a loss contingency is reasonably possible  disclosure is made  including the potential range of loss  if determinable 
loss contingencies that are remote are neither accounted for nor disclosed 
we record legal fees associated with loss contingencies when incurred and do not record estimated future legal fees 
management uses outside legal counsel to assist in estimating the likelihood of the existence of liabilities with regard to all significant legal matters 
we incurred approximately million  million and million of expense for legal matters in  and  respectively 
historically  until  costs paid to outside legal counsel have comprised a majority of our litigation related costs 
we currently believe the range of potential loss for all unresolved legal matters  excluding costs for outside counsel  is from million up to the amounts sought by claimants and have recorded a liability as of september  of million  of which million was incurred in the substantial claims and damages sought by claimants in excess of this amount are not currently deemed to be probable 
our outside counsel and management currently believe that unfavorable outcomes of outstanding litigation beyond the amount accrued are neither probable nor remote 
accordingly  management cannot express an opinion as to the ultimate amount  if any  of our liability  nor is it possible to estimate what litigation related costs will be in future periods 
the specific matters discussed in note raise difficult and complex legal and factual issues  and the resolution of these issues is subject to many uncertainties  including the facts and circumstances of each case  the jurisdiction in which each case is brought  and the future decisions of juries  judges  and arbitrators 
therefore  although management believes that the claims asserted against us in the named cases lack merit  there is a possibility of material losses in excess of the amounts accrued if one or 
table of contents more of the cases were to be determined adversely against us for a substantial amount of the damages asserted 
it is possible that a change in the estimates of probable liability could occur  and the changes could be material 
additionally  as with any litigation  these proceedings require that we incur substantial costs  including attorneys fees  managerial time and other personnel resources  in pursuing resolution 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 
summary 
our total revenue for was million  up from million for gross profit increased  from million in to million in operating income increased from million in to million in  and the loss from continuing operations of million  or a diluted loss per share of  turned positive in and resulted in income of million  or per diluted share 
the net loss including discontinued operations of million  or a diluted loss per share of  also turned positive in with net income of million  or per diluted share  in revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below  by segment 
light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
our stone product group benefitted from strength in new residential construction  and our block product group benefitted from new product introductions and a strong texas economy 
this growth was partially offset by a decline in organic revenue from our siding product group  which has more exposure to the repair and remodel end market than to new housing and which was impacted by poor weather conditions during  particularly in the upper midwest and northeast 
the kleer lumber acquisition added million in revenues in the decline in gross margin in was primarily attributable to a change in revenue mix 
revenue growth in our lower margin block and trim board products  combined with a decline in revenue in the higher margin siding products  resulted in a revenue mix that had lower overall margins in when compared to the significant weakness in the new housing and residential remodeling markets which began several years ago eased somewhat during according to the national association of home builders nahb  the most current and year averages for new housing starts were million and million units  respectively 
however  new housing starts were only million units and million units in calendar and  respectively 
further  during the last years  the five years with the lowest number of housing starts were the five calendar years through in august  the seasonally adjusted annual number of new housing starts was million units  according to the nahb 
also impacting some of our product offerings is a continuing weakness in the repair and remodel end markets 
even though there seems to be a general consensus that a housing market rebound is in process  there are significant regional differences in the strength of this improvement 
for example  the recovery has been much more robust in some areas of the us  such as parts of the south and west  as compared to other regions such as the northeast and midwest  where growth has been minimal 
such regional differences in the health of the housing market can impact the sales of our various product groups differently 
we believe our niche strategy and our focus on productivity improvements and cost reductions have tempered somewhat the impact of the severe slowdown in the housing market  
table of contents however  it is not possible to know when improved market conditions and a housing recovery will become sustainable over the long term 
given our market leadership positions and reduced cost structure  we believe that we are positioned to benefit from a sustained recovery in the housing market when it occurs 
we believe the long term growth prospects in the industry are strong because the current seasonally adjusted annualized housing starts are still well below the and year averages 
also  according to a report by the joint center for housing studies of harvard university  household growth is projected to average between approximately million and million units a year from to heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenue increased due to both higher product sales and improved site service revenue  even though the us infrastructure construction industry remains weak by historical standards 
the shipped volume of high value fly ash declined slightly from to  but was more than offset by price increases 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to geographic changes in fly ash sales  and to non recurring high margin project revenue recorded in according to the portland cement association pca  calendar cement consumption increased over calendar and cement consumption will increase in calendar  with most of the growth caused by gains in the residential construction market 
it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of either cement consumption or cement prices  nor the correlation between cement usage and prices and fly ash sales and prices 
nevertheless  because fly ash is sold as an admixture for the partial replacement of portland cement in a wide variety of concrete uses including infrastructure  commercial  and residential construction statistics and trends for portland and blended cement sales can be an indicator for fly ash sales 
in its most recent report in september  the pca estimated growth rates of for both calendar and and for calendar the pca predicted an increase in local spending on public construction beginning in calendar  the key for which is road construction  which accounts for the largest area of public cement consumption 
low natural gas prices  epa regulations  and reduced power demand  have combined to force the long term shutdown or temporary idling of multiple coal combustion power plant units primarily older  smaller units  negatively impacting the supply of ccps for beneficial use in certain areas 
this trend  which is currently expected to continue until the industry adjusts to requirements to update coal burning plants  has impacted somewhat our ccp supplies in certain regions of the country  however  we have multiple sources of supply and a broad distribution system  which allow us to move ccps to locations where power plant units have closed  creating an opportunity for potential growth 
reallocating ccp supplies can increase our transportation costs  some but not all of which we have historically been able to pass on to customers 
we currently believe that it is likely that the epa will attempt to issue new regulations surrounding the disposal of fly ash by no earlier than december alignment of new water standards with proposed ccp disposal rules could provide strong support for a conclusion that regulation of 
coal combustion products 
under rcra 
resource conservation and recovery act 
subtitle d would be adequate 
based on the epa statements  we believe that the new regulations will be structured with ccps being regulated under rcra subtitle d 
the dc federal district court recently ordered the epa to submit within days its timeline for the review and if necessary  modification of fly ash disposal regulations 
we will have greater certainty as to the timing of any new regulations after the court makes its final determination 
the senate has not yet taken up the fly ash disposal bill passed by the house  hr  the coal residuals reuse and management act of we believe that the 
table of contents house bill adequately protects human health and the environment and meets all reasonable standards necessary for the safe disposal of ccps 
energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
following the decision to sell the coal cleaning business in and the sale of our interest in the blue flint ethanol plant in  our energy technology segment currently consists primarily of operations related to hcat  our heavy oil upgrading catalyst 
the increases in revenue and gross profit were due primarily to the timing of shipments to the two refineries which are currently using hcat 
operating expenses 
amortization of intangible assets was not materially different between and because the increased amortization for the acquired kleer lumber intangible assets offset most of the decrease in amortization expense for assets that have been fully amortized 
selling  general and administrative expenses also did not change materially from to as the costs related to kleer lumber operations subsequent to the date of acquisition  along with million of costs related to the kleer lumber acquisition  were offset by a decrease in cash based compensation tied to stock price movement 
in  we recorded million of restructuring costs as a result of actions taken in to lower operating costs and improve operational efficiency  primarily in the light building products segment  all as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this restructuring effort was completed in the march quarter and no additional restructuring costs related to the actions have been incurred since that time 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the decrease of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of approximately million and a decrease in net other expense of approximately million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in  due primarily to a decrease in interest expense related to our convertible senior subordinated notes  including reduced average levels of debt outstanding and routine and accelerated amortization of debt discount and debt issue costs  and a decrease of approximately million in premiums paid on early debt repayments in than in interest expense in is currently expected to total approximately million 
the reduction in net other expense of million was primarily the result of approximately million of loss in related to our equity interest in the blue flint joint venture which was sold effective january   plus a loss in of approximately million related to another joint venture  partially offset by a decrease of approximately million in gains from the early repayment of convertible debt in income tax provision 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the reasons for the reported effective income tax rate in and the negative rate for  including why we recorded a valuation allowance on our net operating losses  tax credits and other deferred tax assets in both years 
a valuation allowance is required when there is significant uncertainty as to the realizability of deferred tax assets 
because the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future income in domestic and foreign jurisdictions that have generated losses  management determined that we do not meet the more likely than not threshold that nols  tax credits and other deferred tax assets will be realized 
during  we may realize a three year cumulative accounting profit 
if this occurs  we will also consider other positive and negative evidence such as current financial performance  financial and taxable income projections  the market environment and other factors  in evaluating the continued need for a full  or partial  valuation allowance 
any reversal of the valuation allowance will favorably impact our results of operations in the period of reversal 

table of contents discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations in was approximately million  compared to a loss in of million 
in  we recorded an impairment of the coal cleaning assets totaling million 
the losses from operations in also included approximately million of non cash accruals 
we sold one coal cleaning facility during for cash proceeds of million plus potential future consideration and an estimated gain of approximately million was recognized on that sale 
in  we sold the remaining ten facilities and again recognized an estimated gain at the time of sale 
subsequent to the dates of sale in and  some adjustments of the previously recognized estimated gains on the sales transactions were recognized  all of which have been included in the million loss on disposal reported for we currently expect that additional adjustments to the estimated gains and losses may be recognized in as certain contingencies are resolved 
for all sales transactions  a majority of the consideration is in the form of potential production royalties and deferred purchase price  which amounts are dependent upon future plant production levels over several years 
while maximum potential future production royalties and deferred purchase price on the sales transactions could total more than million  such potential proceeds were not considered in the gain or loss calculations and will be accounted for in future periods when any such amounts are received 
in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement for one of the sales transactions  the buyer of the coal cleaning facilities agreed to assume the lease and reclamation obligations related to certain of the facilities 
subsequent to the date of sale  we amended the purchase agreement to provide the buyer with additional time to make payments to us  as well as fulfill contractual requirements related to the assumed reclamation obligations 
the buyer continues to make progress  but as of september   we remain contingently liable for some of the assumed obligations and accrued approximately million to meet those contingent liabilities if necessary 
as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements  we also reserved certain receivables due from the buyer until such time as collection is more certain 
in  we recognized a tax benefit of approximately million in discontinued operations  due primarily to the reversal of unrecognized income tax benefits related to audit periods now closed 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  the information set forth below compares our operating results for the year ended september  with operating results for the year ended september  
except as noted  the references to captions in the statements of operations refer to continuing operations only 
summary 
our total revenue for was million  up from million for gross profit increased  from million in to million in our operating income was million compared to an operating loss of million in  and the loss from continuing operations decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  in our net loss including discontinued operations decreased from million  or a diluted loss per share of  in  to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  in there were several significant non routine adjustments recorded in  including approximately million of interest expense related to our senior debt refinancing of which approximately million was for the early repayment premium related to the repurchase of our senior secured notes  million of coal cleaning asset impairments recorded in loss from discontinued operations  million of restructuring costs  and million of litigation costs 
these adjustments and others are discussed in more detail below 
revenue and gross margins 
the major components of revenue  along with gross margins  are discussed in the sections below  by segment 

table of contents light building products segment 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
sales of light building products in were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
both our siding and stone product groups benefited from improvements in the new residential construction end markets  driving revenue growth from both price and volume increases 
we also believe that some of the product offerings from our siding and stone groups  in particular new products  gained market share 
revenue in our concrete block product group declined in  primarily due to slower school construction in the texas market  but there was improvement in sales from new products  particularly products sold into retail channels  which increased our participation in residential construction 
in  we implemented a major restructuring initiative in the light building products segment that  along with other improvements in the business  positively impacted the gross margin  which increased to in from in heavy construction materials segment 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
heavy construction materials revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
we experienced revenue growth in both ccp sales and in ccp services provided to utilities  as incremental revenue from new projects more than offset the effect of unplanned outages and lower electricity demand 
revenue increases were particularly strong in the central region of the country 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improved product sales  product mix  and our continuous improvement efforts to lower costs 
energy technology segment 
energy technology segment revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
revenues for were million with a corresponding gross profit of million 
in  catalyst sales were lower than in primarily due to reduced usage at one of our customer facilities and the timing of shipments 
operating expenses  including restructuring costs 
amortization of intangible assets decreased in from due to assets that have been fully amortized 
research and development expenses increased approximately million from to  primarily due to changes in long term incentive compensation expense tied in part to changes in our stock price 
the stock price increased during  but decreased during selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately million  from million in to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in litigation expense recognized in as compared to  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and cost reductions initiated in late  largely offset by increased performance based compensation in which increased by more than million over due to compensation which is tied to improved performance and changes in our stock price 
in  we recorded million of restructuring costs as a result of actions taken in to lower operating costs and improve operational efficiency 
this restructuring effort was completed in the march quarter 
other income and expense 
for  we reported net other expense of million  compared to net other expense of million for the decrease of million was comprised of a decrease in net interest expense of approximately million and a decrease in net other income increase in net other expense of approximately million 
net interest expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to approximately million of premium related to the early retirement of our senior secured notes plus approximately million of accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs associated with that early repayment  along with approximately million of reduced interest expense from the lower rate senior debt outstanding in as compared to the higher rate senior debt 
table of contents outstanding for most of  all as described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in net other income increase in net other expense of million was primarily the result of approximately million of income in related to our equity interest in the blue flint joint venture compared to approximately of expense in including a loss on sale of approximately million plus a loss of approximately million related to another joint venture  partially offset by a gain of million from the early repayments of convertible debt in income tax provision 
reference is made to note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the minimal amount of income tax benefit recognized in and the negative effective income tax rate for  including the reasons for recording a full valuation allowance on net operating losses  tax credits and other deferred tax assets in both years 
discontinued operations 
coal sales of million in were lower than sales of million in due primarily to a curtailment of operations pending the sale of the coal cleaning assets 
due to low capacity utilization  idled facilities and feedstock issues  the cost of revenue and operating expenses for the coal cleaning business exceeded revenues in both years 
in addition  we recorded million of impairments of the coal cleaning assets in and a million impairment in we sold one coal cleaning facility in  recognizing a gain of approximately million 
impact of inflation and related matters in certain periods  some of our operations have been negatively impacted by increased raw materials costs for commodities such as polypropylene  poly vinyl chloride and cement in the light building products segment 
beginning in  we experienced some significant cost increases for certain raw materials and transportation fuel 
we currently believe it is possible that costs for raw materials and other commodities such as fuels  along with the prices of other goods and services  could continue to increase in future periods 
we have passed through certain increased raw materials costs to customers  but it is not possible to accurately predict the future trends of these costs  nor our ability to pass on future cost increases 
liquidity and capital resources summary of cash flow activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended september  was approximately million  compared to net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended september  of approximately million 
the primary difference in operating cash flows between the two periods related to the change of approximately million from a net loss in to net income in  due to improved results in both continuing operations and in discontinued operations 
there was a reduction in operating cash flows from to of approximately million due to lower non cash expenses such as accelerated amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount  asset impairments  restructuring costs and losses of unconsolidated joint ventures 
the third significant difference in operating cash flows between and was a decrease of approximately million related to changes in working capital accounts 
in  more cash was used to pay accrued liabilities  particularly compensation related obligations  because those liabilities were much higher at september  than they were at september  in  our primary investing activity consisted of the kleer lumber acquisition 
purchases of property  plant and equipment were approximately million in and million in in  we had million of proceeds from the sale of our equity interest in the blue flint joint venture  and in we had million of proceeds from the sale of our discontinued operations  compared to million in in  our primary financing activity was approximately 
table of contents million of payments on long term debt  and in our primary financing activities consisted of approximately million of net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and million of payments on long term debt 
more details about these and other investing and financing activities are provided in the following paragraphs 
investing activities 
on december   we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of kleer lumber  inc  a company in the light building products industry 
total consideration paid for kleer lumber  all of which was cash  was approximately million 
direct acquisition costs  consisting primarily of fees for advisory  legal and other professional services  totaled approximately million 
in both and  a majority of capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment was for maintenance of operating capacity in our light building products segment  with a smaller amount related to other segments and more discretionary expenditures for new product lines or projects 
capital expenditures in for both maintenance and growth are currently expected to be in the range of million  as compared to approximately million incurred during each of the past three years 
funding for capital expenditures is expected to come from working capital 
as of september   we were committed to spend approximately million on capital projects that were in various stages of completion 
as noted earlier  in  we assessed the strategic fit of our various operations and decided to divest of the coal cleaning business which did not align with our long term strategy 
in september  the board of directors committed to a plan to sell the coal cleaning business  which has been classified as a discontinued operation since that time 
we sold one coal cleaning facility in and the remaining ten facilities in for proceeds of approximately million and million  respectively 
for all sales transactions  a majority of the consideration is in the form of potential production royalties and deferred purchase price  which amounts are dependent upon future plant production levels over several years 
such potential proceeds were not considered in the gain or loss calculations and will be accounted for in future periods when any such amounts are received 
in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement for one of the sales transactions  the buyer of the coal cleaning facilities agreed to assume the lease and reclamation obligations related to certain of the facilities 
subsequent to the date of sale  we amended the purchase agreement to provide the buyer with additional time to make payments  as well as fulfill contractual requirements related to the assumed reclamation obligations 
the buyer continues to make progress  but as of september   we remain contingently liable for some of the assumed obligations and accrued approximately million to meet those contingent liabilities if necessary 
as reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements  we also reserved certain receivables due from the buyer until such time as collection is more certain 
we intend to continue to expand our business through growth of existing operations in our core light and heavy building materials businesses 
acquisitions have historically been an important part of our long term business strategy  however  primarily because of debt covenant restrictions  cash flow considerations and events affecting the debt and equity markets  we did not make any large acquisitions from until the december acquisition of kleer lumber described above 
we have also invested in joint ventures accounted for using the equity method of accounting  one of which was sold in and one of which was sold in we do not currently have plans to significantly increase our investments in any of the remaining joint venture entities  none of which is material 
current debt agreements limit potential acquisitions and investments in joint ventures 
until the abl revolver was amended in november  acquisitions were limited to total cumulative consideration of million during the original five year term  and million annually 
a waiver of this limitation was received for the kleer lumber acquisition 
as amended  the abl revolver limits potential acquisitions and 
table of contents investments in joint ventures if pro forma net excess availability is or less of total potential availability under the facility 
financing activities 
in  we issued million shares of common stock for gross cash proceeds of approximately million 
offering costs totaled approximately million  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  of which approximately million was used to acquire kleer lumber 
in several transactions in  we repurchased and canceled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible senior subordinated notes for cash consideration of approximately million 
the premiums plus accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were charged to interest expense 
in  we issued approximately million of new convertible senior subordinated notes in exchange for cancellation of an equal amount of outstanding notes  plus a cash payment of approximately million 
the unamortized balances of debt discount and debt issue costs related to the million of retired notes  aggregating approximately million  were written off and charged to interest expense 
the notes have a maturity date of february  two years after the maturity date of the notes  which extended maturity date was the primary reason for issuing the notes 
the maturity date for the notes better matched our projected generation of free cash flow 
other than the different interest rate and two year extended maturity date  the terms of the notes are similar in all material respects to the terms of the notes 
also in  we repurchased and canceled approximately million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes for cash consideration of approximately million in several different transactions 
terms of repayment for some of these transactions included premiums totaling approximately million  which were charged to interest expense 
for certain other transactions  gains totaling approximately million were recognized and recorded in other income 
accelerated debt discount and debt issue costs aggregating approximately million were charged to interest expense 
all of the outstanding convertible notes mature in february  and our other outstanding debt matures from through we believe our cash flow will be sufficient to repay all outstanding long term debt on or before the due dates 
following certain asset sales  as defined  we could be required to prepay a portion of the senior secured notes 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of september  the senior secured notes and abl revolver limit the incurrence of additional debt and liens on assets  prepayment of future new subordinated debt  merging or consolidating with another company  selling all or substantially all assets  making acquisitions and investments and the payment of dividends or distributions  among other things 
in addition  if availability under the abl revolver is less than of the total million commitment  or million currently  we are required to maintain a monthly fixed charge coverage ratio of at least x for the preceding twelve month period 
there have been no borrowings under the abl revolver since it was entered into in october the abl revolver has a termination date of october  with a contingent provision for early termination at any time within three months prior to the earliest maturity date of the senior secured notes or any of the convertible senior subordinated notes currently november  at which time any amounts borrowed must be repaid 
the contingent provision for early termination is precluded if borrowing base capacity under the abl revolver and or cash collateral is at least equivalent to the amount of notes maturing on such date 
availability under the abl revolver cannot exceed million  which includes a million sub line for letters of credit and a million swingline facility 
availability under the abl revolver is further limited by the borrowing base valuations of the assets of our light building products and heavy construction materials segments which secure the 
table of contents borrowings  currently consisting of certain trade receivables and inventories 
in addition to the first lien position on these assets  the abl revolver lenders have a second priority position on substantially all other assets 
as of september   availability under the abl revolver was approximately million 
however  due primarily to the seasonality of our operations  the amount of availability varies from period to period and  while not currently expected  it is possible that the availability under the abl revolver could fall below the threshold  or million  in a future period 
as of september   our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined in the abl revolver agreement  is approximately the fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated by dividing ebitdar minus capital expenditures and cash payments for income taxes by fixed charges 
ebitdar consists of net income loss i plus net interest expense  income taxes as defined  depreciation and amortization  non cash charges such as goodwill and other impairments  and rent expense  ii plus or minus other specified adjustments such as equity earnings or loss in joint ventures 
fixed charges consist of cash payments for debt service plus rent expense 
if availability under the abl revolver were to decline below million at some future date and the fixed charge coverage ratio were to also be below  the abl revolver lender could issue a notice of default 
if a notice of default were to become imminent  we would seek an amendment to the abl revolver  or alternatively  a waiver of the availability requirement and or fixed charge coverage ratio for a period of time 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed descriptions of the terms of our long term debt and our abl revolver 
in february  we filed a universal shelf registration statement with the sec under which million was available for offerings of securities 
following the above described issuance of common stock  there is approximately million available for future securities offerings 
a prospectus supplement describing the terms of any additional securities to be issued is required to be filed before any future offering can commence under the registration statement 
working capital 
as of september   our working capital was million including million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million as of september  we currently expect operations to produce positive cash flow during and in future years 
we also currently believe working capital will be sufficient for our operating needs for the next months  and that it will not be necessary to utilize borrowing capacity under the abl revolver for our seasonal operational cash needs for the foreseeable future 
income taxes 
cash outlays for income taxes were less than million for both and as of september   our nol and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately million tax effected 
the us and state nols and capital losses expire from to substantially all of the non us nols  which are not material  do not expire 
in addition  there are approximately million of tax credit carryforwards as of september   which expire from to we do not currently expect cash outlays for income taxes during the next months to be significant 
summary of future cash requirements 
significant cash requirements for the next months  beyond seasonal operational working capital requirements  consist primarily of repayment of the convertible notes million  interest payments on long term debt and capital expenditures 
in subsequent periods  significant cash requirements will include the repayment of other debt  but not prior to february see note to the consolidated financial statements where the potential risks of litigation are described in detail 
adverse conclusions to those legal matters could involve material amounts of cash outlays in future periods

as of september   we had approximately million of unrecognized income tax benefits  including million of potential interest and penalties 
due to the number of years under audit and the matters being examined  at the current time an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made beyond amounts currently accrued  nor can we reliably estimate the timing of any potential payments 
reference is made to the caption compensation arrangements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of potential commitments to certain officers and employees under employment agreements  executive change in control agreements  cash performance unit awards and cash settled sars 
amounts in addition to those included in the table above could become obligations under the terms of those agreements  depending upon the outcomes of the future events described in note we have ongoing litigation and asserted claims which have been incurred during the normal course of business  including the specific matters discussed in note we intend to vigorously defend or resolve these matters by settlement  as appropriate 
we have recorded a liability of million as of september  for all legal matters  however  it is not possible to know what amounts will ultimately be paid  nor the time periods any such payments will occur and accordingly  no amounts for legal matters have been included in the table above 
we do not currently believe that the outcome of

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily related to our stock price 
in addition  future borrowings  if any  under our abl revolver will bear interest at a variable rate  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
through december   we were also exposed to market risks related to the activities of one of our joint ventures  the blue flint joint venture  which had derivatives in place related to variable interest rates and commodities 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we sold our interest in that joint venture effective january  cash performance unit awards 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the compensation committee approved grants of performance unit awards to certain officers and employees in the corporate business unit  to be settled in cash  based on the achievement of goals related to consolidated cash flow generated during during  we recorded approximately million of expense for the performance unit awards  calculated based on the consolidated cash flow achieved for the year and an increase in the stock price between september  and september  during  the committee approved grants of performance unit awards to participants in certain business units related to consolidated cash flow generated during  with terms similar to those for the awards 
during  we recorded approximately million of expense for the performance unit awards  calculated based on the consolidated cash flow achieved for the year and an increase in the stock price between september  and september  subsequent to september   the committee approved grants of performance unit awards to participants in certain business units related to consolidated cash flow generated during  again with terms similar to those for the and awards  with one added feature that provides for potential further adjustment based on cash flows generated in and changes in our cash flow generation as well as changes in the stock price through september  will result in adjustment of the expected liability as of september   which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter through september  changes in the stock price can result in an increase or decrease in the estimated september  payout liability  however  any adjustments are also dependent upon the amount of cash flow generated during potential adjustments to the expense may also occur in and  depending on cash flows generated in those years 
cash settled sar grants 
in  the committee approved grants to certain employees of approximately million cash settled sars  approximately million of which remain outstanding as of september  these sars vested in annual installments through september   provided the participant was still employed by us at the respective vest dates  and are settled in cash upon exercise by the employee 
the sars terminate on september  and must be exercised on or before that date 
as of september   million has been accrued for outstanding awards because the stock price at september  was above the grant date stock price of 
future changes in our stock price in any amount above through september  will result in adjustment to the expected remaining liability  which adjustment whether positive or negative will be reflected in our statement of operations each quarter
