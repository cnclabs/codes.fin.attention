item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
real estate operations at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet  that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
a typical lease agreement has an initial term of five to twenty years with renewal options 
most of our lessees are responsible for a portion of maintenance  taxes and other executory costs 
we require our lessees to maintain adequate levels of insurance 
we recognized lease revenue of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
retail when we operated retail stores  we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provided  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts and to recognize the associated deferred income and expenses  including the cost to repair or replace covered products  over the remaining life of the contracts 
we have classified as discontinued operations all retail related activities  including those activities associated with extended service plans  in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
facilities at january   we owned six former retail store properties that were leased to outside  unrelated parties 
there were also vacant former retail store properties that we were attempting to either lease or sell 
in addition  we have one former distribution center that is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office and partially vacant 
our consolidated ethanol entities own a combined acres of land and two facilities with an annual nameplate capacity of million gallons of ethanol each 
employees at january   we had employees at our two consolidated ethanol plants and at our corporate headquarters 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union 
we expect this employment level to remain relatively stable 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
service marks we have registered the service marks rex  and farmers energy  with the united states patent and trademark office 
we are not aware of any adverse claims concerning our service marks 
item a 
risk factors we encourage you to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this report when considering an investment decision in rex common stock 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
in this instance  the trading price of rex stock could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
we have concentrations of cash deposits at financial institutions that exceed federal insurance limits 
we generally have cash deposits that exceed federal insurance limits 
should the financial institutions we deposit our cash at experience insolvency or other financial difficulty  our access to cash deposits could be limited 
in extreme cases  we could lose our cash deposits entirely 
this would negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
the current interest rate environment has resulted in lower yields on our excess cash 
we have experienced lower yields on our excess cash compared to historical yields 
should the present economic conditions result in a sustained period of historically low interest rates  our interest income would be negatively impacted 
risks related to our synthetic fuel investments and income tax benefits we face synthetic fuel risks as future irs audits may result in the disallowance of previously recognized tax credits 
we have recognized investment income of approximately million from the sales of our partnership interests from years that the partnerships have not been audited by the internal revenue service irs 
should the tax credits be denied on any future audit and we fail to prevail through the irs or the legal process  there could be significant refunds of previously recognized income with a significant adverse impact on earnings and cash flows 
the production and sale of synthetic fuel qualified for section k tax credits if certain requirements were satisfied  including a requirement that the synthetic fuel differs significantly in chemical composition from the coal used to produce the synthetic fuel and that the fuel was produced from a facility placed in service before july  we may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million of alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards and approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards recorded as deferred tax assets on our consolidated financial statements 
should future results of operations or other factors cause us to determine that it is not more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our deferred tax assets  we would then be required to establish a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets 
we would increase our income tax expense by the amount of the tax benefit we do not expect to realize 
this would negatively impact our net income loss and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial position 
risks related to our alternative energy business the ethanol industry is changing rapidly which could result in unexpected developments that could negatively impact our operations 
the ethanol industry has grown significantly in recent years 
according to the rfa  the ethanol industry has grown from approximately billion gallons of annual ethanol production in to approximately billion gallons of annual ethanol production in thus  there have been significant changes in the supply and demand of ethanol over a relatively short period of time which could lead to difficulty in maintaining profitable operations at our ethanol plants 
if cash flow from operations of our ethanol plants is not sufficient to service debt  the plants could fail and we could lose our entire investment 
our ethanol plants financed approximately of plant construction cost with debt 
the debt typically has a balloon payment due after five years 
the ability of each company owning the plant to repay borrowings incurred will depend upon the plant s financial and operating performance 
the cash flows and capital resources of an ethanol plant may be insufficient to repay its debt obligations 
if a plant cannot service its debt  it may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  restructure its indebtedness or seek additional capital 
if unable to do so  the value of our investment could decline significantly 
the institutional senior lenders to the companies which own and operate our ethanol plants hold liens on the plant s assets 
if a company fails to make its debt service payments  the senior lender will have the right to repossess the plant s assets in addition to other remedies  which are superior to our rights as an equity investor 
such action could have a material adverse impact on our investment in the ethanol plant 
we operate in a capital intensive industry 
limitations to external financing could adversely affect our financial performance 
in general  continued volatility in the capital markets has resulted in reduced availability of capital for the ethanol industry 
we may need to incur additional financing to fund growth of our business or in times of increasing liquidity requirements such as increases in raw material costs 
any delays to obtain additional financing  or our inability to do so  could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are highly dependent on commodity prices  which are subject to significant volatility and uncertainty  and the availability of supplies  so our results could fluctuate substantially 
the financial returns on our ethanol investments are substantially dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn or other feedstock  natural gas  ethanol and unleaded gasoline 
as a result of the volatility of the prices for these items  the returns may fluctuate substantially and our investments could experience periods of declining prices for their products and increasing costs for their raw materials  which could result in operating losses at our ethanol plants 
our returns on ethanol investments are highly sensitive to grain prices 
corn is the principal raw material our ethanol plants use to produce ethanol and co products 
as a result  changes in the price of corn can significantly affect their businesses 
rising corn prices result in higher costs of ethanol and co products 
because ethanol competes with non corn based fuels  our ethanol plants may not be able to pass along increased grain costs to their customers 
at certain levels  grain prices may make ethanol uneconomical to produce 
the price of corn is influenced by weather conditions and other factors affecting crop yields  transportation costs  farmer planting decisions  exports  the value of the us dollar and general economic  market and regulatory factors 
these factors include government policies and subsidies with respect to agriculture and international trade and global and local demand and supply 
the significance and relative effect of these factors on the price of corn is difficult to predict 
any event that tends to negatively affect the supply of corn  such as adverse weather or crop disease  could increase corn prices and potentially harm the business of our ethanol plants 
increasing domestic ethanol capacity could boost the demand for corn and result in increased corn prices 
much of the midwestern united states experienced drought conditions during which led to a smaller harvest of corn and increased corn prices 
our ethanol plants may also have difficulty  from time to time  in physically sourcing corn on economical terms due to supply shortages 
such a shortage could require our ethanol plants to suspend operations which would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
the spread between ethanol and corn prices can vary significantly 
the gross margin at our ethanol plants depends principally on the spread between ethanol and corn prices 
fluctuations in the spread are likely to continue to occur 
a sustained narrow or negative spread or any further reduction in the spread between ethanol and corn prices  whether as a result of sustained high or increased corn prices or sustained low or decreased ethanol prices  would adversely affect the results of operations at our ethanol plants 
our risk management strategies may be ineffective and may expose us to decreased profitability and liquidity 
in an attempt to partially offset the impact of volatility of commodity prices  we enter into forward contracts to sell a portion of our ethanol and distillers grains production and to purchase a portion of our corn and natural gas requirements 
the financial impact of these risk management activities is dependent upon  among other items  the prices involved and our ability to receive or deliver the commodities involved 
risk management activities can result in financial loss when positions are purchased in a declining market or when positions are sold in an increasing market 
we vary the amount of risk management techniques we utilize  and we may choose not to engage in any risk management activities 
should we fail to properly manage the inherent volatility of commodities prices  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
the market for natural gas is subject to market conditions that create uncertainty in the price and availability of the natural gas that our ethanol plants use in their manufacturing process 
our ethanol plants rely upon third parties for their supply of natural gas  which is consumed as fuel in the production of ethanol 
the prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions 
these market conditions often are affected by factors beyond the ethanol plants control  such as weather conditions  overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulation and relations 
significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair the ethanol plants ability to economically manufacture ethanol for their customers 
furthermore  increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect results of operations and financial position at our ethanol plants 
fluctuations in the selling price of commodities may reduce profit margins at our ethanol plants 
ethanol is marketed as a fuel additive to reduce vehicle emissions from gasoline  as an octane enhancer to improve the octane rating of gasoline with which it is blended and  to a lesser extent  as a gasoline substitute 
as a result  ethanol prices are influenced by the supply and demand for gasoline and our ethanol plants results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected if gasoline demand decreases 
distillers grains compete with other protein based animal feed products 
the price of distillers grains may decrease when the prices of competing feed products decrease 
the prices of competing animal feed products are based in part on the prices of the commodities from which their products are made 
historically  sales prices for distillers grains have tracked along with the price of corn 
however  there have been instances when the price increase for distillers grains has lagged price increases in corn prices 
the production of distillers grains has increased as a result of increases in dry mill ethanol production in the united states 
this could lead to price declines in what we can sell our distillers grains for in the future 
such declines could have an adverse material effect on our results of operations 
increased ethanol production or decreases in demand for ethanol may result in excess production capacity in the ethanol industry  which may cause the price of ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil to decrease 
according to the rfa  domestic ethanol production nameplate capacity is approximately billion gallons per year at january the rfa estimates that  as of january  approximately million gallons per year of additional production capacity is under construction 
current ethanol production capacity exceeds the rfs requirement which can be satisfied by corn based ethanol billion gallons 
excess capacity in the ethanol industry could have an adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
in a manufacturing industry with excess capacity  producers have an incentive to manufacture additional products for so long as the price exceeds the marginal cost of production ie  the cost of producing only the next unit  without regard for interest  overhead or fixed costs 
this incentive could result in the reduction of the market price of ethanol to a level that is inadequate to generate sufficient cash flow to cover costs 
excess capacity may also result from decreases in the demand for ethanol  which could result from a number of factors  including  but not limited to  regulatory developments and reduced us gasoline consumption 
reduced gasoline consumption could occur as a result of increased prices for gasoline or crude oil  which could cause businesses and consumers to reduce driving or acquire vehicles with more favorable gasoline mileage or acquire hybrid vehicles 
in addition  because ethanol production produces distillers grains and non food grade corn oil as co products  increased ethanol production will also lead to increased supplies of distillers grains and non food grade corn oil 
an increase in the supply of distillers grains and non food grade corn oil  without corresponding increases in demand  could lead to lower prices or an inability to sell our ethanol plants distillers grains and non food grade corn oil production 
a decline in the price of distillers grains or non food grade corn oil could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
trade restrictions on ethanol exports could reduce the demand for ethanol 
the european union began imposing a tariff  on ethanol imported from the united states  of per metric ton effective february  if producers and exporters of ethanol are subject to trade restrictions  or additional duties are imposed on exports  it may make it uneconomical to export ethanol 
this could result in an oversupply of ethanol in the united states which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
we depend on our partners to operate certain of our ethanol investments 
our investments currently represent both majority and minority equity positions 
day to day operating control of minority owned plants generally remains with the local farmers cooperative or investor group that has promoted the plant 
we may not have the ability to directly modify the operations of these plants in response to changes in the business environment or in response to any deficiencies in local operations of the plants 
in addition  local plant operators  who also represent the primary suppliers of corn and other crops to the plants  may have interests  such as the price and sourcing of corn and other crops  that may differ from our interest  which is based solely on the operating profit of the plant 
the limitations on our ability to control day to day plant operations could adversely affect plant results of operations 
we may not successfully acquire or develop additional ethanol investments 
the growth of our ethanol business depends on our ability to identify and develop new ethanol investments 
our ethanol development strategy depends on referrals  and introductions  to new investment opportunities from industry participants  such as ethanol plant builders  financial institutions  marketing agents and others 
we must continue to maintain favorable relationships with these industry participants  and a material disruption in these sources of referrals would adversely affect our ability to expand our ethanol investments 
any expansion strategy will depend on prevailing market conditions for the price of ethanol and the costs of corn and natural gas and the expectations of future market conditions 
there is increasing competition for suitable sites for ethanol plants 
even if suitable sites or opportunities are identified  we may not be able to secure the services and products from contractors  engineering firms  construction firms and equipment suppliers necessary to build or expand ethanol plants on a timely basis or on acceptable economic terms 
construction costs associated with expansion may increase to levels that would make a new plant too expensive to complete or unprofitable to operate 
additional financing may also be necessary to implement any expansion strategy  which may not be accessible or available on acceptable terms 
our ethanol plants may be adversely affected by technological advances and efforts to anticipate and employ such technological advances may prove unsuccessful 
the development and implementation of new technologies may result in a significant reduction in the costs of ethanol production 
for instance  any technological advances in the efficiency or cost to produce ethanol from inexpensive  cellulosic sources such as wheat  oat or barley straw could have an adverse effect on our ethanol plants  because those facilities are designed to produce ethanol from corn  which is  by comparison  a raw material with other high value uses 
we cannot predict when new technologies may become available  the rate of acceptance of new technologies by competitors or the costs associated with new technologies 
in addition  advances in the development of alternatives to ethanol could significantly reduce demand for or eliminate the need for ethanol 
any advances in technology which require significant unanticipated capital expenditures to remain competitive or which reduce demand or prices for ethanol would have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
in addition  alternative fuels  additives and oxygenates are continually under development 
alternative fuel additives that can replace ethanol may be developed  which may decrease the demand for ethanol 
it is also possible that technological advances in engine and exhaust system design and performance could reduce the use of oxygenates  which would lower the demand for ethanol  and the results of our ethanol operations may be materially adversely affected 
the us ethanol industry is highly dependent upon a myriad of federal and state legislation and regulation and any changes in legislation or regulation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
the effect of the renewable fuel standard rfs program in the energy independence and security act of the act is uncertain 
the domestic market for ethanol is largely dictated by federal mandates for blending ethanol with gasoline 
the rfs mandate level for conventional biofuels for of billion gallons is lower than current constructed nameplate capacity of approximately billion gallons 
future demand will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline versus ethanol  taking into consideration the relative octane value of ethanol  environmental requirements and the rfs 
any significant increase in production capacity beyond the rfs level could have a negative impact on ethanol prices 
additionally  the rfs mandate with respect to ethanol derived from grain could be reduced or waived entirely 
in august  governors from eight states petitioned the epa for a waiver of the rfs requirements 
the epa announced on november  that the request for waivers of the rfs requirements was denied 
a reduction or waiver of the rfs mandate could negatively affect ethanol prices and our future performance 
the rfs flexibility act was introduced on october  in the us house of representatives to reduce or eliminate the volumes of renewable fuel use required by rfs based upon corn stocks to use ratios 
the domestic alternative fuels act of was introduced on january  in the us house of representatives to modify the rfs to include ethanol and other fuels produced from fossil fuels like coal and natural gas 
our operations and resulting financial performance could be adversely impacted if the rfs flexibility act or the domestic alternative fuels act of are enacted into law 
the elimination of the blender s credit could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
the american jobs creation act of created the volumetric ethanol tax credit  referred to as the blender s credit 
this credit allowed gasoline distributors who blended ethanol with gasoline to receive a federal excise tax credit of per gallon of pure ethanol  or per gallon if blended with ethanol e  and per gallon if blended with ethanol e 
the per gallon incentive for ethanol expired on december  this credit was a significant benefit to our customers and the elimination of this credit makes our product less attractive to customers 
changes in corporate average fuel economy standards could adversely impact ethanol prices 
flexible fuel vehicles receive preferential treatment in meeting federally mandated corporate average fuel economy cafe standards for automobiles manufactured by car makers 
high blend ethanol fuels such as e result in lower fuel efficiencies 
absent the cafe preferences  car makers would not likely build flexible fuel vehicles 
any change in cafe preferences could reduce the growth of e markets and result in lower ethanol prices 
various studies have criticized the efficiency of ethanol  in general  and corn based ethanol in particular  which could lead to the reduction or repeal of incentives and tariffs that promote the use and domestic production of ethanol or otherwise negatively impact public perception and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
although many trade groups  academics and governmental agencies have supported ethanol as a fuel additive that promotes a cleaner environment  others have criticized ethanol production as consuming considerably more energy and emitting more greenhouse gases than other biofuels and as potentially depleting water resources 
other studies have suggested that corn based ethanol is less efficient than ethanol produced from switchgrass or wheat grain and that it negatively impacts consumers by causing prices for dairy  meat and other foodstuffs from livestock that consume corn to increase 
if these views gain acceptance  support for existing measures promoting use and domestic production of corn based ethanol could decline  leading to reduction or repeal of these measures 
these views could also negatively impact public perception of the ethanol industry and acceptance of ethanol as an alternative fuel 
federal support of cellulosic ethanol may result in reduced incentives to corn derived ethanol producers 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the energy independence and security act of provide funding opportunities in support of cellulosic ethanol obtained from biomass sources such as switchgrass and poplar trees 
the amended rfs mandates an increasing level of production of non corn derived biofuels 
these federal policies may suggest a long term political preference for cellulosic processes using alternative feedstocks such as switchgrass  silage or wood chips 
cellulosic ethanol has a smaller carbon footprint and is unlikely to divert foodstuff from the market 
several cellulosic ethanol plants are under development and there is a risk that cellulosic ethanol could displace corn ethanol 
our plants are designed as single feedstock facilities  located in corn production areas with limited alternative feedstock nearby  and would require significant additional investment to convert to the production of cellulosic ethanol 
the adoption of cellulosic ethanol as the preferred form of ethanol could have a significant adverse effect on our ethanol business 
our ethanol business is affected by environmental and other regulations which could impede or prohibit our ability to successfully operate our plants 
our ethanol production facilities are subject to extensive air  water and other environmental regulations 
we have had to obtain numerous permits to construct and operate our plants 
regulatory agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in the permits that are detrimental or which increase our costs 
more stringent federal or state environmental regulations could be adopted which could significantly increase our operating costs or require us to expend considerable resources 
our ethanol plants emit various airborne pollutants as by products of the ethanol production process  including carbon dioxide 
in  the us supreme court classified carbon dioxide as an air pollutant under the clean air act in a case seeking to require the epa to regulate carbon dioxide in vehicle emissions 
in february  the epa released its final regulations on the renewable fuel standard program rfs 
we believe our plants are grandfathered at their current operating capacity  but plant expansion will need to meet a threshold reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions from a baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the rfs mandate 
to expand our plant capacity  we may be required to obtain additional permits  install advanced technology equipment  or reduce drying of certain amounts of distillers grains 
we may also be required to install carbon dioxide mitigation equipment or take other steps in order to comply with future laws or regulations 
compliance with future laws or regulations of carbon dioxide  or if we choose to expand capacity at certain of our plants  compliance with then current regulations of carbon dioxide  could be costly and may prevent us from operating our plants as profitably  which may have a negative impact on our financial performance 
the california air resources board carb has adopted a low carbon fuel standard lcfs requiring a reduction in ghg emissions from transportation fuels by an indirect land use charge is included in this lifecycle ghg emission calculation 
on december   the us district court for the eastern district of california issued several rulings in federal lawsuits challenging the lcfs 
one of the rulings preliminarily prevents carb from enforcing these regulations during the pending litigation 
on january   carb unsuccessfully attempted to appeal these rulings in the us district court for the eastern district of california and on january  filed another appeal with the ninth circuit court of appeals 
while this standard is currently being challenged by various lawsuits  implementation of such a standard may have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanol in california 
while this standard is being challenged by lawsuits  implementation of such a standard could have an adverse impact on the market for corn based ethanol in california if corn based ethanol fails to achieve lifecycle ghg emission reductions 
this could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
our ethanol business may become subject to various environmental and health and safety and property damage claims and liabilities 
operations of our ethanol business will expose the business to the risk of environmental and health and safety claims and property damage claims  such as failure to comply with environmental regulations 
these types of claims could also be made against our ethanol business based upon the acts or omissions of other persons 
serious claims could have a material negative impact on our results of operations  financial position and future cash flows 
our business is not significantly diversified 
our financial results depend heavily on our ability to operate our ethanol plants profitably 
we do not have significant other lines of business or other sources of revenue to depend upon if we are unable to operate our ethanol plants profitably 
such lack of significant diversification could have a material negative impact on our results of operations  financial position and future cash flows should our ethanol plants operate unprofitably 
our revenue from the sale of distillers grains depends upon its continued market acceptance as an animal feed 
distillers grains is a co product from the fermentation of corn to produce ethanol 
antibiotics may be used during the fermentation process to control bacterial contamination  therefore antibiotics may be present in small quantities in distillers grains marketed as animal feed 
the u 
s 
food and drug administration s  or fda s  center for veterinary medicine has expressed concern about potential animal and human health hazards from the use of distillers grains as an animal feed due to the possibility of antibiotic residues 
if the public became concerned about the impact of distillers grains in the food supply or as an acceptable animal feed  the market for distillers grains could be negatively impacted  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
at certain of our plants  we extract and sell non food grade corn oil immediately prior to the production of distillers grains 
several studies are trying to determine how non food grade corn oil extraction may impact the nutritional value of the resulting distillers grains 
if it is determined that non food grade corn oil extraction adversely impacts the energy content of distillers grains  the value of the distillers grains we sell may be negatively impacted  which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
the price of distillers grains may decline as a result of restrictions or duties on distillers grains exports from the united sates 
exports of distiller grains produced in the united states have been increasing in recent years 
however  the export market may be jeopardized if foreign governments impose trade barriers or other measures to protect the foreign local markets 
if producers and exporters of distillers grains are subjected to trade barriers when selling distillers grains to foreign customers  there may be a reduction in the price of distillers grains in the united states 
declines in the price we receive for our distillers grains could lead to decreased revenues and may result in our inability to operate our ethanol plants profitably 
we face significant competition in the ethanol industry 
we face significant competition for new ethanol investment opportunities 
there are varied enterprises seeking to participate in the ethanol industry 
some enterprises provide financial and management support similar to our business model 
other enterprises seek to acquire or develop plants which they will directly own and operate 
many of our competitors are larger and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
we must compete for investment opportunities based on our strategy of supporting and enhancing local development of ethanol plant opportunities 
we may not be successful in competing for investment opportunities based on our strategy 
the ethanol industry is primarily comprised of smaller entities that engage exclusively in ethanol production and large integrated grain companies that produce ethanol along with their base grain business 
several large oil companies have entered the ethanol production market 
if these companies increase their ethanol plant ownership or other oil companies seek to engage in direct ethanol production  there would be less of a need to purchase ethanol from independent producers like our ethanol plants 
larger firms offer efficiencies and economies of scale  resulting in lower costs of production 
in addition  plants sold as part of a bankruptcy proceeding may have significantly lower fixed costs than our ethanol plants 
absent significant growth and diversification  our ethanol plants may not be able to operate profitably in a more competitive environment 
no assurance can be given that our ethanol plants will be able to compete successfully or that competition from larger companies with greater financial resources will not have a materially adverse impact on the results of our ethanol operations 
we may face competition from foreign companies 
there is a risk of foreign competition in the ethanol industry 
brazil is presently the second largest producer of ethanol in the world 
brazil s ethanol production  which is sugarcane based  has historically been cheaper to produce than corn based ethanol 
if significant additional foreign ethanol production capacity is created  such facilities could create excess supplies of ethanol  which may result in lower prices of ethanol 
in addition  foreign ethanol producers may be able to produce ethanol at costs lower than ours 
these risks could have significant adverse effects on our financial performance 
in addition  the tariff that protected the us ethanol industry expired at the end of the u 
s 
ethanol industry experienced increased competition from ethanol producers outside of the u 
s 
during the expiration of the tariff could lead to continued increases in the import of ethanol produced outside of the us we are exposed to credit risk from our sales of ethanol and distillers grains to customers 
the inability of a customer to make payments to us for our accounts receivable may cause us to experience losses and may adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to make our payments when due 
we may not be able to hire and retain qualified personnel to operate our ethanol plants 
our ability to attract and retain competent personnel has a significant impact on operating efficiencies and plant profitability 
competition for key plant employees in the ethanol industry can be intense  and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees 
failure to do so could have a negative impact on our financial results at individual plants 
our plants depend on an uninterrupted supply of energy and water to operate 
unforeseen plant shutdowns could harm our business 
our plants require a significant and uninterrupted supply of natural gas  electricity and water to operate 
we generally rely on third parties to provide these resources 
if there is an interruption in the supply of energy or water for any reason  such as supply  delivery or mechanical problems and we are unable to secure an adequate alternative supply to sustain plant operations  we may be required to stop production 
a production halt for an extended period of time could result in material losses 
potential business disruption from factors outside our control  including natural disasters  severe weather conditions  accidents  strikes  unexpected equipment failures and unforeseen plant shutdowns  could adversely affect our cash flow and operating results 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants contain restrictive financial and performance covenants 
our subsidiaries that operate ethanol plants ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that contain covenants with several financial and performance restrictions 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the applicable agreement 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary would likely seek a waiver of that default  attempt to reset the covenant  or refinance the instrument and accompanying obligations 
if the ethanol subsidiary was unable to obtain this relief  the default could result in the acceleration of the total due related to that debt obligation 
if a default were to occur  the ethanol subsidiary may not be able to pay its debts or borrow sufficient funds to refinance them 
in addition  certain lease agreements could also be in default if a default of the debt agreement occurs 
in the past  we have received waivers from our lenders for failure to meet certain financial covenants and have amended our subsidiary loan agreements to change these covenants 
no assurance can be given that  if we are unable to comply with these covenants in the future  we will be able to obtain the necessary waivers or amend our subsidiary loan agreements to prevent a default 
any of these events  if they occur  could materially adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the debt agreements for the ethanol plants limit  or otherwise restrict the amount of dividends and other payments the ethanol subsidiaries can transfer to their members 
we are dependent on dividends from our ethanol subsidiaries to generate cash flow 
presently  all of our ethanol subsidiaries have debt agreements that limit payments to members 
therefore  these companies cannot distribute all of the cash they generate to their members 
furthermore  we may not be able to use the excess cash flow from one subsidiary to fund corporate needs or needs of another operating ethanol subsidiary 
changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the results of our ethanol operations 
one earth has an interest rate swap at january  that  in essence  fixes the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
during fiscal years  and  we recognized losses on this swap 
further reductions in interest rates could increase the liability position of the interest rate swap  requiring us to record additional expense which could be material 
the liability for this interest rate swap could also result in a default of the term loan agreement s restrictive financial covenants 
in addition  increases in interest rates could have a negative impact on results of operations as all of the debt our ethanol plants have is variable rate debt 
furthermore  the interest rate swap does not fix the interest rate on the entire portion of the related debt 
we rely on information technology in our operations and financial reporting and any material failure  inadequacy  interruption or security breach of that technology could harm our ability to efficiently operate our business and report our financial results accurately and timely 
we rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations  including for management of inventory  purchase orders  production  invoices  shipping  accounting and various other processes and transactions 
our ability to effectively manage our business  coordinate the production  distribution and sale of our products and ensure the timely and accurate recording and disclosure of financial information depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems 
the failure of these systems to operate effectively  problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems  or a breach in security of these systems through a cyber attack or otherwise could cause delays in product sales  reduced efficiency of our operations and delays in reporting our financial results 
significant capital investments could be required to remediate any such problem 
security breaches of employee information or other confidential or proprietary data could also adversely impact our reputation  and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties 
risks related to the exit of our retail business and risks related to our real estate segment 
our future costs associated with administering extended product service contracts may result in higher than expected costs 
we will continue to administer extended product service contracts that have contractual maturities over the next year 
to the extent we do not have products or an adequate repair service network to satisfy warranty claims  we may incur material costs as we would be required to refund cash to customers for warranted products 
we have a significant amount of vacant warehouse and retail space after the completion of the wind down of our retail business 
at january   we own one distribution facility and former retail store properties comprising approximately  square feet of vacant real estate 
we are currently marketing these facilities for lease or sale 
we may not be able to successfully lease or sell these properties which could result in lost opportunities for revenue or future impairment charges related to the carrying value of the associated assets 
we also have costs related to the vacant properties such as property taxes and utilities that we would have to bear without any revenue from such properties

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview historically  we were a specialty retailer in the consumer electronics and appliance industry serving small to medium sized towns and communities 
in addition  we have been an investor in various alternative energy entities beginning with synthetic fuel partnerships in and later ethanol production facilities beginning in in fiscal year  we began to evaluate strategic alternatives for our retail segment with a focus on closing unprofitable or marginally profitable retail stores and monetizing our retail related real estate assets 
we did not believe that we were generating an adequate return from our retail business due to the competitive nature of the consumer electronics and appliance industry and the overall economic conditions in the united states 
we completed our exit of the retail business as of july  going forward  our only retail related activities will consist of the administration of extended service plans we previously sold and the payment of related claims 
all activities related to extended service plans are classified as discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements for all or parts of six former retail properties and had vacant former retail properties 
we also own one former distribution center  which is partially leased  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel and partially vacant 
we are marketing the vacant properties to lease or sell 
should our marketing efforts result in additional tenants to whom we lease property  we would expect to execute leases with a term of five to twenty years 
we currently have equity investments in four ethanol production entities  two of which we have a majority ownership interest in 
we may make additional investments in the alternative energy segment during fiscal year our ethanol operations are highly dependent on commodity prices  especially prices for corn  ethanol  distillers grains and natural gas 
as a result of price volatility for these commodities  our operating results can fluctuate substantially 
the price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general  including crop conditions  weather  federal policy and foreign trade 
because the market price of ethanol is not always directly related to corn prices  at times ethanol prices may lag movements in corn prices and  in an environment of higher prices  reduce the overall margin structure at the plants 
as a result  at times  we may operate our plants at negative or marginally positive operating margins 
we expect our ethanol plants to produce approximately gallons of denatured ethanol for each bushel of grain processed in the production cycle 
we refer to the difference between the price per gallon of ethanol and the price per bushel of grain divided by as the crush spread 
should the crush spread decline  our ethanol plants are likely to generate operating results that do not provide adequate cash flows for sustained periods of time 
in such cases  production at the ethanol plants may be reduced or stopped altogether in order to minimize variable costs at individual plants 
we expect these decisions to be made on an individual plant basis  as there are different market conditions at each of our ethanol plants 
we attempt to manage the risk related to the volatility of grain and ethanol prices by utilizing forward grain purchase and forward ethanol and distillers grain sale contracts 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol and distillers grains sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate gross margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months  thus  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future income or loss from the operations of our ethanol facilities 
the crush spread realized in was subject to significant volatility and was negative for a large portion of the year 
for calendar year  the average chicago board of trade cbot near month corn price was approximately per bushel  ranging from a low of approximately per bushel in june to a high of approximately per bushel in august 
ethanol prices had significant fluctuations ranging from approximately per gallon in june to approximately per gallon in july 
ethanol and corn prices have tended to trade in the same direction but with varying spreads 
in  the cbot crush spread ranged from a low of approximately negative per gallon to a high of approximately per gallon 
we believe ethanol demand in early was impacted by the expiration of the volumetric ethanol tax credit blender credit as of december  crush spreads remained negative throughout the majority of due to the continued over supply of ethanol and rising corn prices in the last half of the year  resulting from drought conditions 
crush spreads have improved in although they have remained negative absent the consideration of distillers grains and non food grade corn oil 
prices for distillers grains we sell generally trend with grain prices 
these prices have partially offset the decline in the crush spread 
we reported segment loss profit before income taxes and noncontrolling interests from our alternative energy segment of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year the decrease in profitability primarily resulted from lower crush spreads compared to the prior year experienced in the ethanol industry for a majority of fiscal year and higher corn prices resulting from drought weather conditions throughout the midwest 
we expect that future operating results from our consolidated ethanol plants will be based upon combined annual production of between and million gallons of ethanol  which assumes that one earth and nugen will operate at or near nameplate capacity 
however  due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results being similar to the fiscal year results 
ethanol investments in fiscal year  we entered the alternative energy industry by investing in several entities organized to construct and  subsequently operate  ethanol producing plants 
we are currently invested in four entities as of january   utilizing equity investments 
the following table is a summary of our ethanol investments at january  gallons in millions entity trailing months ethanol gallons shipped rex s current ownership interest current effective ownership of trailing months ethanol gallons shipped one earth energy  llc nugen energy  llc patriot holdings  llc big river resources w burlington  llc big river resources galva  llc big river united energy  llc big river resources boyceville  llc total investment in synthetic fuel partnerships we had invested in three limited partnerships which owned facilities producing synthetic fuel 
the partnerships earned federal income tax credits under section k of the internal revenue code based upon the tonnage and content of solid synthetic fuel produced and sold to unrelated parties 
the section k tax credit program expired on december  during fiscal year  we sold our membership interest in a limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
in addition to certain other payments  the company was eligible to receive per ton of qualified production produced by the facility and sold through december the plant was subsequently sold and during fiscal year  the company modified its agreement with the owners and operators of the synthetic fuel facility 
during fiscal year  a final payment of million was received with respect to the qualified production 
income related to this payment was recognized during fiscal year  as collectability of the amount became assured 
we will not receive additional payments  or recognize additional income  from this investment 
real estate operations at january   we have lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
retail we completed the exit of our retail business during the second quarter of fiscal year we offered extended service contracts to our customers which typically provide  inclusive of manufacturers warranties  one to five years of warranty coverage 
we plan to manage and administer these contracts over the life of the contracts 
service contract repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
we expect to continue recognizing extended service contract revenues and expenses as discontinued operations through january  although the revenues will decline annually as we are no longer selling new contracts 
we typically service a warranty claim through a network of third party repair and service providers 
results of operations for a detailed analysis of period to period changes  see the segment discussion that follows this section as this is how management views and monitors our business 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were approximately million  a increase from approximately million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from operations classified as discontinued operations 
this increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of approximately million 
the increase in alternative energy segment sales was primarily a result of consolidating nugen for the full year in fiscal year we accounted for the results of nugen using the equity method of accounting until the fourth quarter of fiscal year  at which time we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen  and thus  began consolidating the results 
net sales and revenue from our real estate segment increased million over the prior year to approximately million 
the following table reflects the approximate percent of net sales and revenue for each product and service group for the periods presented fiscal year product or service category ethanol distillers grains other total gross profit gross profit was approximately million in fiscal year  or of net sales and revenue  versus approximately million in fiscal year or of net sales and revenue 
this represents a decrease of approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal year decreased by approximately million from the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
gross loss for fiscal year decreased by approximately million compared to the prior year from our real estate segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately million of net sales and revenue  an increase of approximately million or from approximately million of net sales and revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior year  these expenses increased approximately million in the alternative energy segment 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and million  respectively  from our equity investments in big river  patriot and nugen 
effective november   we acquired an additional equity interest in nugen  which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota which shipped approximately million gallons of ethanol in the fiscal year ended january  as of november   we ceased using the equity method of accounting for nugen and began consolidating their results prospectively 
we acquired our initial ownership interest in nugen on july  we currently have a equity interest in nugen 
big river has an effective ownership of ethanol gallons shipped in the trailing twelve months ended january  of approximately million gallons 
patriot has one plant which shipped approximately million gallons of ethanol in the trailing months ended january  income from big river and patriot in fiscal year was significantly lower than fiscal year levels 
income from big river was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
income from patriot was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
big river s and patriot s results in the current year were negatively impacted from the decreased crush spread experienced in the ethanol industry 
income from nugen was approximately million in fiscal year effective november   we ceased using the equity method of accounting for nugen and began consolidating the results of nugen 
overall  we expect the trends in crush spread margins described in the overview section to be generally consistent with the operating experience of big river and patriot as their results are dependent on the same key drivers ethanol  corn and natural gas pricing 
due to the inherent volatility of the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood of future operating results from big river and patriot being similar to the fiscal year results 
bargain purchase gain  net on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen 
we applied acquisition accounting for this business combination achieved in stages  and recognized a loss of approximately million by remeasuring the fair value of our equity method investment at the acquisition date and a bargain purchase gain of approximately million related to the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeding our consideration given for such net assets 
the bargain purchase gain  net  was approximately million 
income from synthetic fuel investments during fiscal year we received approximately million as final payment related to the sale of our membership interest in a limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
we will not receive nor recognize any additional amounts from the sale of our membership interest 
interest income interest income of approximately million for fiscal year was approximately million lower than interest income for fiscal year interest income declined primarily as a result of lower levels of excess cash invested and yields earned on such excess cash 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year this increase is primarily a result of consolidating nugen beginning november  versus using the equity method of accounting for nugen prior to november  based on current interest rates and debt levels  we expect interest expense to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year loss on early termination of debt during fiscal year  we completed the early payoff of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  during fiscal year  as loss on early termination of debt 
other income other income was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
non recurring income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during the fiscal year is the primary reason for the decrease 
we do not expect other income to be significant in future periods 
loss on disposal of real estate and property and equipment  net we recognized losses of approximately million in fiscal year  which was primarily the result of certain equipment being disposed of in our alternative energy segment 
loss on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that one earth entered into during fiscal year one of the swaps expired in july and the other expires in july in general  declining interest rates have a negative effect on our interest rate swaps as our swaps fixed the interest rate of variable rate debt 
as interest rates declined during fiscal years and  we incurred losses on the interest rate swap 
should interest rates continue to decline  we would expect to experience continued losses on the remaining interest rate swap 
we would expect to incur gains on the interest rate swap should interest rates increase 
we cannot predict the future movements in interest rates  thus  we are unable to predict the likelihood or amounts of future gains or losses related to the interest rate swap 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interests of the companies we consolidate  as we recognize of their income or loss in continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 
however  we only provide an income tax provision or benefit for our portion of the subsidiaries income or loss with a noncontrolling interest 
in addition  our effective rate was favorably impacted by approximately during fiscal year as a result of domestic production activities deductions resulting from operations at certain of our ethanol plants 
loss or income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  loss from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year versus income of approximately million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified all retail related results as discontinued operations 
as a result  we had income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year this income includes the amortization of deferred income related to extended service contracts sold when we operated the former retail segment 
six properties classified as discontinued operations were sold during fiscal year  resulting in a gain  net of taxes  of approximately million 
we sold or disposed of eight former retail store locations classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year  as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year we expect income from discontinued operations to decline in future periods as our extended service plan activities wind down 
noncontrolling interests income or loss related to noncontrolling interests was approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  and represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of one earth full year of fiscal year and and nugen full year of fiscal year and fourth quarter of fiscal year 
noncontrolling interests of one earth and nugen were approximately million and  respectively  during fiscal year noncontrolling interests of one earth and nugen were approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal year net loss or income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net loss attributable to rex common shareholders was approximately million for fiscal year compared to income of million for fiscal year business segment results we have two segments alternative energy and real estate 
the real estate segment was formerly included in the retail segment 
for former retail stores and warehouses closed which we have a retained interest in the related real estate  operations are presented in the real estate segment 
historical results from retail store operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
as discussed in note  our chief operating decision maker as defined by accounting standards codification asc segment reporting evaluates the operating performance of our business segments using a measure we call segment profit 
segment profit excludes income taxes  interest expense  discontinued operations  indirect interest income and certain other items that are included in net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management believes these are useful financial measures  however  they should not be construed as being more important than other comparable gaap measures 
items excluded from segment profit generally result from decisions made by corporate executives 
financing  divestiture and tax structure decisions are generally made by corporate executives 
excluding these items from our business segment performance measure enables us to evaluate business segment operating performance based upon current economic conditions 
amounts in the corporate category below include business activities that are not separately reportable and income from synthetic fuel investments

one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year effective november   we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen 
thus  we began consolidating the results of nugen prospectively as of the acquisition date 
prior to november   we used the equity method of accounting to account for the results of nugen 
effective january   we sold a portion of our ownership interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we deconsolidated levelland hockley effective january  on april   levelland hockley voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of texas 
in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings  the plant was sold on may  and on august   the bankruptcy case was converted to a chapter proceeding 
as a result  we have no remaining ownership or financial interest in levelland hockley and have classified the results of levelland hockley as discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes sales from one earth and nugen  by product group amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol   dried distillers grains   modified distillers grains   other   total   the following table summarizes selected operating data from one earth and nugen years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains average selling price per ton of modified distillers grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million  primarily a result of consolidating nugen for the full year in fiscal year we accounted for the results of nugen using the equity method of accounting until the fourth quarter of fiscal year  at which time we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen  and thus  began consolidating the results 
ethanol sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per gallon of ethanol decreased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our ethanol sales were based upon approximately million gallons in the current year compared to approximately million gallons in the prior year 
our dried distillers grains sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
the average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our dried distillers grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in the current year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
the average selling price per ton of modified distillers grains increased from in the prior year to in the current year 
our modified distillers grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in the current year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
non food grade corn oil sales were approximately million in fiscal year fiscal year was the first year that our consolidated plants produced and sold non food grade corn oil 
the increase in gallons of ethanol sold  tons of dried distillers grains sold and the increase in modified distillers grains sold resulted primarily from including the results of nugen for the full year in the current year but only the fourth quarter in the prior year 
we expect that sales in future periods will be based upon the following one earth and nugen only product annual sales quantity ethanol million to million gallons dried distillers grains  to  tons modified distillers grains  to  tons non food grade corn oil million to million pounds this expectation assumes that one earth and nugen will continue to operate at or near capacity  which is dependent upon the crush spread realized 
gross profit from alternative energy segment sales was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
the crush spread for fiscal year was approximately per gallon of ethanol sold compared to fiscal year which was approximately per gallon of ethanol sold 
grain accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year natural gas accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year given the inherent volatility in ethanol  distillers grains  non food grade corn oil  grain and natural gas prices  we cannot predict the likelihood that the spread between ethanol  distillers grains  non food grade corn oil and grain prices in future periods will be consistent compared to historical periods 
we attempt to match quantities of ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil sale contracts with an appropriate quantity of grain purchase contracts over a given period of time when we can obtain an adequate margin resulting from the crush spread inherent in the contracts we have executed 
however  the market for future ethanol sales contracts is not a mature market 
consequently  we generally execute fixed price contracts for no more than three months into the future at any given time 
as a result of the relatively short period of time our fixed price contracts cover  we generally cannot predict the future movements in the crush spread for more than three months 
less than of our forecasted ethanol  approximately of our forecasted distillers grains and approximately of our forecasted non food grade corn oil production during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
the effect of a adverse change in the price of ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues in fiscal year of approximately million 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next months was subject to fixed price contracts 
the effect of a adverse change in the price of corn from current pricing would result in an increase in annual cost of goods sold in fiscal year of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year the increase is primarily a result of including the results of nugen for the full year in the current year but only the fourth quarter in the prior year  which resulted in approximately million of increased expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this increase was partially offset by a decrease in incentive compensation of approximately million  a result of decreased segment profitability 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to remain consistent with the fiscal year results in future periods 
income from equity method investments in big river  patriot and nugen decreased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in the current year 
we recognized approximately million of income from big river in fiscal year which is approximately million lower than the prior year amount of approximately million 
big river s results in the current year were negatively impacted from the decreased crush spread experienced in the ethanol industry 
we recognized approximately million of income from patriot in fiscal year  which is approximately million lower than the prior year amount of approximately million 
patriot s results in the current year were negatively impacted from the decreased crush spread experienced in the ethanol industry 
we recognized approximately million of income pursuant to the equity method of accounting from nugen in fiscal year effective november   we ceased using the equity method of accounting for nugen and began consolidating the results of nugen 
given the inherent volatility in the factors that affect the crush spread  we cannot predict the likelihood that the trend with respect to income from equity method investments will continue in future periods 
on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen 
we applied acquisition accounting for this business combination achieved in stages  and recognized a loss of approximately million by remeasuring the fair value of our equity method investment at the acquisition date and a bargain purchase gain of approximately million related to the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeding our consideration given for such net assets 
this resulted in a bargain purchase gain  net  of approximately million 
interest expense increased approximately million in the current year from the prior year to approximately million 
this increase is primarily a result of consolidating nugen beginning november   versus using the equity method of accounting for nugen prior to november  based on current interest rates and debt levels  we expect interest expense to be in the range of million to million in fiscal year other income decreased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year non recurring income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during the prior year is the primary reason for the decrease 
we do not expect other income to be significant in future periods 
losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth were approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
since the gains or losses on these derivative financial instruments are primarily a function of the movement in interest rates  we cannot predict the likelihood that such gains or losses in future periods will be consistent with current year results 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment results decreased to a loss of approximately million in the current year from a profit of approximately million in the prior year 
real estate the real estate segment includes all owned and sub leased real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we have lease agreements  as landlord  for six owned former retail stores  square feet 
we have owned former retail stores  square feet that are vacant at january  we are marketing these vacant properties to lease or sell 
in addition  one former distribution center is partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for the current year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a lease for a portion of a distribution center that was executed during the third quarter of fiscal year and leases for two properties that were executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during the current year compared to approximately million during the prior year 
gross loss decreased primarily as a result of impairment charges of approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
we expect gross profit or loss for fiscal year to be insignificant based upon leases currently executed 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  consistent with the approximately million in fiscal year we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to remain consistent with comparable historical periods 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss was approximately million in the current year compared to approximately million in the prior year 
excluding any property sales that may occur in fiscal year  we expect to generate another segment loss in fiscal year based upon the current number of vacant properties 
corporate and other corporate and other includes certain administrative expenses of the corporate headquarters  interest expense and interest income not directly allocated to the alternative energy or real estate segments and income from synthetic fuel investments 
selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in the current year consistent with the approximately million of expenses in the prior year 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses in future periods to be consistent with current year levels 
interest expense of approximately million in the current year is consistent with prior year expense 
interest income of approximately million in the current year is approximately lower than the prior year income 
interest income declined primarily as a result of lower levels of excess cash invested and yields earned on such excess cash 
comparison of fiscal years ended january  and net sales and revenue net sales and revenue in fiscal year were approximately million  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year net sales and revenue do not include sales from operations classified in discontinued operations 
the increase was primarily caused by higher sales in our alternative energy segment of approximately million 
this increase is primarily a result of higher commodity prices during fiscal year and the acquisition of nugen completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year net sales and revenue from our real estate segment increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million 
gross profit gross profit was approximately million in fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year this represents an increase of approximately million 
gross profit for fiscal year increased by approximately million over the prior year as a result of operations in the alternative energy segment 
gross loss for fiscal year increased by approximately million compared to the prior year from our real estate segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year were approximately million of net sales and revenue  an increase of approximately million or from approximately million of net sales and revenue for fiscal year compared to the prior year  these expenses increased approximately million in the alternative energy segment and decreased approximately million in the corporate and other category  respectively 
equity in income of unconsolidated ethanol affiliates during fiscal years and  we recognized income of approximately million and approximately million  respectively from our equity investments in big river  patriot and nugen 
effective november   we acquired an additional equity interest in nugen  which operates an ethanol producing facility in marion  south dakota 
as of november   we ceased using the equity method of accounting for nugen and began consolidating their results prospectively 
we acquired our initial ownership interest in nugen on july  we currently have a equity interest in nugen 
income from big river and patriot in fiscal year was relatively consistent with fiscal year levels

big river benefited in fiscal year from increases in by product pricing and patronage dividends 
income from patriot was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
income from nugen was approximately million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase results primarily from increased crush spreads realized and recognizing ten months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year versus six months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year bargain purchase gain  net on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen

this resulted in a bargain purchase gain  net  of approximately million 
income from synthetic fuel investments during fiscal year we received approximately million as final payment related to the sale of our membership interest in a limited liability company that owned a synthetic fuel facility in gillette  wyoming 
interest income interest income of approximately million for fiscal year was consistent with the prior year 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million for fiscal year from approximately million for fiscal year the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the alternative energy segment as a result of consolidating nugen effective november  loss on early termination of debt during fiscal years and  we completed the early payoff of mortgage debt prior to maturity 
as a result  we expensed certain unamortized financing costs and prepayment penalties of approximately  and  during fiscal years and  respectively 
other income other income increased to approximately million in fiscal year nonrecurring income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during the current year is the primary reason for the increase 
losses on derivative financial instruments we recognized losses of approximately million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  related to forward interest rate swaps that one earth entered into during fiscal year one of the swaps expired in july and one expires in july in general  declining interest rates have a negative effect on our interest rate swaps as our swaps fixed the interest rate of variable rate debt 
as interest rates declined during fiscal years and  we incurred losses on the interest rate swap 
income taxes our effective tax rate was and for fiscal years and  respectively 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the noncontrolling interests of the companies we consolidate  as we recognize of their income or loss in continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interests 
however  we only provide an income tax provision or benefit for our portion of the subsidiaries income or loss with a noncontrolling interest 
in addition  our effective rate was favorably impacted by approximately during fiscal year as a result of domestic production activities deductions resulting from operations at certain of our ethanol plants 
income from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  income from continuing operations was approximately million for fiscal year versus approximately million for fiscal year discontinued operations during fiscal year  we closed our remaining retail store and warehouse operations and reclassified all retail related results as discontinued operations 
in addition  we have no remaining ownership or financial interest in levelland hockley and classify the results of levelland hockley as discontinued operations 
on april   levelland hockley voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of texas 
in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings  the plant was sold on may  and on august   the bankruptcy case was converted to a chapter proceeding 
we had income from discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year compared to a loss of approximately million in fiscal year discontinued operations in both years include the amortization of deferred income related to extended service contracts sold when we operated the former retail segment 
eight properties were also sold and classified as discontinued operations during fiscal year  resulting in a gain  net of taxes  of approximately million 
we sold or disposed of ten former retail store locations classified as discontinued operations in fiscal year  as a result  we had a gain from disposal of discontinued operations  net of taxes  of approximately million in fiscal year the large loss in fiscal year was primarily attributable to the recognition of losses totaling approximately million pre tax related to the impairment of notes receivable from levelland hockley and the deconsolidation of levelland hockley 
noncontrolling interests income or loss related to noncontrolling interests was approximately million and approximately million for fiscal years and  respectively  and represents the owners other than us share of the income or loss of one earth full year of fiscal year and nugen fourth quarter of fiscal year and one earth and levelland hockley fiscal year 
noncontrolling interests of one earth and nugen were approximately million and approximately million  respectively during fiscal year noncontrolling interests of one earth and levelland hockley were approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal year net income attributable to rex common shareholders as a result of the foregoing  net income attributable to rex common shareholders was approximately million for fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year in addition to the information discussed above  the following sections discuss the results of operations for each of our business segments and corporate and other 
alternative energy the alternative energy segment includes the consolidated financial statements of one earth and nugen  our other investments in ethanol facilities  the income related to those investments and certain administrative expenses 
one earth began limited production operations late in the second quarter of fiscal year and became fully operational during the third quarter of fiscal year effective november   we obtained a controlling financial interest in nugen 
thus  we began consolidating the results of nugen prospectively as of the acquisition date 
prior to november   we used the equity method of accounting to account for the results of nugen 
effective january   we sold a portion of our ownership interest in levelland hockley 
as a result  we no longer had a controlling financial interest in levelland hockley  and therefore  we deconsolidated levelland hockley effective january  on april   levelland hockley voluntarily filed for protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court  northern district of texas 
in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings  the plant was sold on may  and on august   the bankruptcy case was converted to a chapter proceeding 
as a result  we have no remaining ownership or financial interest in levelland hockley and have classified the results of levelland hockley as discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes sales from one earth and nugen by product group during periods of consolidation amounts in thousands years ended january  ethanol   dried distillers grains   modified distillers grains  other  total   the following table summarizes selected operating data from one earth and nugen during periods of consolidation years ended january  average selling price per gallon of ethanol average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains average selling price per ton of modified distillers grains average cost per bushel of grain average cost of natural gas per mmbtu net sales and revenue for fiscal year increased approximately million over the prior year to approximately million  primarily a result of increases in ethanol and dried distillers grains prices during fiscal year and the consolidation of nugen s results effective november  ethanol sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in fiscal year the average selling price per gallon of ethanol increased from in the prior year to in fiscal year our ethanol sales were based upon approximately million gallons in fiscal year compared to approximately million gallons in the prior year 
dried distillers grains sales increased from approximately million in the prior year to approximately million in fiscal year the average selling price per ton of dried distillers grains increased from in the prior year to in fiscal year our dried distillers grains sales were based upon approximately  tons in fiscal year compared to approximately  tons in the prior year 
gross profit from alternative energy segment sales was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year gross profit improved primarily because of the volume and price increases in ethanol and distillers grains sold discussed above 
grain accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year natural gas accounted for approximately million of our cost of sales during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  a million increase from approximately million in fiscal year a majority of the increase results from higher incentive compensation expense related to higher segment profitability during fiscal year income from equity method investments in big river  patriot and nugen increased from approximately million in fiscal year to approximately million in fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from big river in fiscal year which is approximately higher than the fiscal year amount of approximately million 
big river benefited in fiscal year from increases in by product pricing and patronage dividends 
we recognized approximately million of income from patriot in fiscal year which is consistent with the approximately million of income recognized in fiscal year we recognized approximately million of income from nugen in fiscal year which is approximately million higher than the approximately million of income recognized in fiscal year the increase results primarily from increased crush spreads realized and recognizing ten months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year versus six months of equity method income from nugen in fiscal year on november   we acquired of the outstanding membership units of nugen  which resulted in us owning approximately of the outstanding membership units in nugen 
we applied acquisition accounting for this business combination achieved in stages  and recognized a loss of approximately million by remeasuring the fair value of our equity method investment at the acquisition date and a bargain purchase gain of approximately million related to the fair value of the assets acquired less liabilities assumed exceeding our consideration given for such net assets 
this resulted in a bargain purchase gain  net  of approximately million 
interest expense increased approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year to approximately million  primarily a result of consolidating nugen in fiscal year other income increased to approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year income recognized by nugen related to dividends paid by a co operative during fiscal year is the primary reason for the increase 
losses on derivative financial instruments held by one earth were approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year the losses in both fiscal year and  were primarily a function of the movement in interest rates in those respective years 
as a result of the factors discussed above  segment profit increased to approximately million in fiscal year from approximately million in fiscal year real estate the real estate segment includes all owned real estate including those previously used as retail store and distribution center operations  our real estate leasing activities and certain administrative expenses 
it excludes results from discontinued operations 
at january   we had lease agreements  as landlord  for six former retail stores  square feet 
we had owned former retail stores  square feet  that were vacant at january  in addition  one former distribution center was partially leased  square feet  partially occupied by our corporate office personnel  square feet and partially vacant  square feet 
net sales and revenue for fiscal year increased approximately million over the fiscal year amount to approximately million 
the increase in revenue is primarily a result of a lease for a portion of a distribution center that was executed during the fourth quarter of fiscal year gross loss from this segment was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million during fiscal year gross loss increased primarily as a result of impairment charges of approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year  consistent with the million in fiscal year as a result of the factors discussed above  segment loss was approximately million in fiscal year compared to approximately million in fiscal year corporate and other selling  general and administrative expenses were approximately million in fiscal year consistent with the approximately million of expenses in fiscal year interest expense of approximately million in fiscal year was consistent with the expense in fiscal year interest income of approximately million in fiscal year was consistent with the income in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of cash have been income from operations  dividends from ethanol investments and sales of real estate 
our primary uses of cash have been investments in ethanol entities  capital expenditures at our ethanol plants  long term debt repayments and stock repurchases 
outlook our cash balance of approximately million includes approximately million held by one earth and nugen 
pursuant to their debt agreements  one earth and nugen are limited with respect to paying dividends 
thus  we expect that one earth and nugen will use a majority of their cash for working capital and debt service needs 
all of our ethanol investments have significant amounts of long term debt and we expect these organizations to limit the payment of dividends based upon working capital needs  debt service requirements and the requirements of their respective loan agreements 
debt service payments in excess of scheduled amounts related to ethanol debt is the result of excess cash sweeps that are required pursuant to the respective ethanol plant s debt agreement and are based upon percentages of profitability 
we continue to investigate investment opportunities in various companies and industries 
another possible use of our excess cash is to repurchase our common stock 
we typically repurchase our common stock when our stock price is trading at prices we deem to be a discount to the underlying value of our net assets 
historically  we have not incurred additional borrowings to fund repurchases of our common stock 
we also plan to seek and evaluate other various investment opportunities including energy related  agricultural or other ventures we believe fit our investment criteria 
we can make no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to find such opportunities 
we expect that our ethanol operations will continue to be challenged during fiscal year until at least the fall harvest 
a continued tight corn supply has negatively impacted the financial results of our ethanol plants 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect our financial performance from our ethanol plants to improve compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year as the crush spread has increased from levels 
the cbot crush spread excludes any impact from variations in local corn and ethanol prices and basis paid averaged approximately per gallon of ethanol during the first quarter of calendar year compared to approximately per gallon of ethanol during the fourth quarter of calendar year we do not have combined significant commitments for capital expenditures at january  we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of approximately million to million in fiscal year we expect to fund such capital expenditures with available cash at our ethanol plant subsidiaries

cash of approximately million was provided by proceeds from the sale of real estate and property and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately million during fiscal year compared to approximately million for fiscal year during fiscal year  repayments of debt were approximately million

one earth subsidiary level debt in september  one earth entered into a  financing agreement consisting of a construction loan agreement for  together with a  revolving loan and a  letter of credit with first national bank of omaha 
the construction loan was converted into a term loan on july  the term loan bears interest at variable interest rates ranging from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points to at january

tabular disclosure of contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business  we enter into agreements under which we are obligated to make legally enforceable future cash payments 
these agreements include obligations related to purchasing inventory  long term debt and interest rate management 
the following table summarizes by category expected future cash outflows associated with contractual obligations in effect as of january  amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations    interest on variable rate debt a    interest on fixed rate debt other b      total c     a the interest rates effective as of january  for variable rate loans were used to calculate future payments of interest on variable rate debt 
b amounts represent primarily payments due for rail car usage contracts at one earth and nugen 
c we are not able to determine the likely settlement period for uncertain tax positions  accordingly  approximately million of uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties have been excluded from the table above 
we are not able to determine the likely settlement period  if any  for interest rate swaps  accordingly approximately million of liabilities for derivative financial instruments have been excluded from the table above 
we are not able to determine the likely settlement for forward basis corn purchase contracts  accordingly  payments for such contracts have been excluded from the table above 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations we have experienced seasonality in our ethanol business during fiscal years and as we had experienced higher sales  gross margins and operating profits during the fourth quarter of those fiscal years 
this trend was not experienced in fiscal year and we believe this trend is unlikely to continue into future years with the expiration of the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit as of december  we believe the expiration of the tax credit or threat of the expiration fiscal year created an increase in ethanol demand during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and impact of inflation the impact of inflation has not been material to our results of operations for the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies we believe the application of the following accounting policies  which are important to our financial position and results of operations  require significant assumptions  judgments and estimates on the part of management 
we base our assumptions  judgments  and estimates on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
further  if different assumptions  judgments and estimates had been used  the results could have been different and such differences could be material 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize sales from ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil when title transfers to customers  upon shipment from our plant 
shipping and handling charges billed to ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil customers are included in net sales and revenue 
we include income from our real estate leasing activities in net sales and revenue 
we account for these leases as operating leases 
accordingly  minimum rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
we sold  prior to our exit of the retail business  retail product service contracts covering periods beyond the normal manufacturers warranty periods  usually with terms of coverage including manufacturers warranty periods of between to months 
contract revenues and sales commissions are deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the contracts after the expiration of applicable manufacturers warranty periods 
we retain the obligation to perform warranty service and such costs are charged to operations as incurred 
all related revenue and expense is classified in discontinued operations 
we recognized income from synthetic fuel partnership sales as the synthetic fuel was produced and sold except for operations at the gillette facility as we did not believe that collection of our proceeds for production occurring subsequent to september  was reasonably assured from that plant until the third quarter of fiscal year see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of synthetic fuel partnership sales 
investments the method of accounting applied to long term investments  whether consolidated  equity or cost  involves an evaluation of the significant terms of each investment that explicitly grant or suggest evidence of control or influence over the operations of the investee and also includes the identification of any variable interests in which we are the primary beneficiary 
the evaluation of consolidation under asc consolidation is complex and requires judgments to be made 
we consolidate the results of two majority owned subsidiaries  one earth and nugen 
the results of one earth are included on a delayed basis of one month 
the company accounts for investments in limited liability companies in which it may have a less than ownership interest  using the equity method of accounting when the factors discussed in asc investments equity method and joint ventures are met 
the excess of the carrying value over the underlying equity in the net assets of equity method investees is allocated to specific assets and liabilities 
any unallocated excess is treated as goodwill and is recorded as a component of the carrying value of the equity method investee 
investments in businesses that the company does not control but for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters are accounted for using the equity method 
investments in which the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters are accounted for using the cost method 
the company accounts for its investments in big river resources  llc big river and patriot holdings  llc patriot using the equity method of accounting and includes the results of these entities on a delayed basis of one month 
we periodically evaluate our investments for impairment due to declines in market value considered to be other than temporary 
such impairment evaluations include  in addition to persistent  declining market prices  general economic and company specific evaluations 
if we determine that a decline in market value is other than temporary  then a charge to earnings is recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for all or a portion of the unrealized loss  and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
inventory inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the market value of inventory is often dependent upon fluctuating commodity prices 
if these estimates are inaccurate  we may be exposed to market conditions that require an additional reduction in the value of certain inventories affected 
we provide for a permanent write down of inventory  for inventory items that have a cost greater than net realizable value 
the write down of inventory was approximately  and  at january  and  respectively 
fluctuations in the write down of inventory generally relate to the levels and composition of such inventory at a given point in time 
the assumptions we currently use include our estimates of the selling prices of ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil 
financial instruments forward grain purchase and ethanol and distillers grains sales contracts are accounted for under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exemption of asc  derivatives and hedging asc because these arrangements are for purchases of grain and sales of ethanol and distillers grains that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used by us over a reasonable period of time in the normal course of business 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage our balance of fixed and variable rate debt 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
our swap agreement was not designated for hedge accounting pursuant to asc the interest rate swap is recorded at fair value and the change in fair value is recorded as gain or loss on derivative financial instruments in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the most significant factor that impacts the fair value calculation is the estimate of future interest rates over the remaining life of the swap agreement 
changes to the estimate could impact the fair value calculation materially 
accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  we apply the accounting requirements of asc  business combinations  asc  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  we analyze a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates and assumptions for certain future commodity prices 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the future commodity prices 
in determining the fair value of the company s assets associated with the purchase of nugen on november   we utilized two valuation methods market approach this method estimates fair value based on market prices in actual transactions and on asking prices for assets currently available for sale 
this valuation process is essentially that of comparison and correlation between other similar assets and those of nugen 
income approach this method estimates fair value based upon the present value of cash flows we expect to generate from nugen s operations over nugen s remaining useful life 
we used the discounted cash flow method 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the acquisition of nugen 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes  net of valuation allowances 
we base our estimate of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and other expectations about future outcomes 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
we have established valuation allowances for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we determined that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to allow for the full utilization of the federal net operating loss and federal amt credit carryforward and other deferred tax assets other than those reserved 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  we have assumed that our ethanol plants and real estate assets will generate future taxable income 
we are projecting that the future operations of one earth and nugen will be profitable 
we are assuming that we will be relatively successful in our real estate marketing efforts 
in addition  we have considered the fact that our amt credit carryforward has an indefinite life and that federal net operating losses can be carried forward up to twenty years 
in general  we have used approximately million as the assumed average of future years pre tax income 
we believe our assumed target level of earnings is reasonable based upon historical experience and expectations of real estate rental income and ethanol plant operating income 
in addition  we considered other factors in our assessment 
although during fiscal years  and we realized a taxable loss  we generated taxable income in fiscal year through our ethanol and real estate operations 
furthermore  the taxable loss is attributable  in large part  to accelerated depreciation deductions for income tax purposes 
such deductions are not expected to continue at levels we have seen in the last three years as evidenced by the net deferred tax liability of approximately million recorded at january  in addition  we have significant financial resources to deploy in future income producing activities 
a valuation allowance of approximately million and approximately million was recorded at january  and january   respectively which is primarily for certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
should estimates of future income differ significantly from our prior estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the primary assumption used to estimate the valuation allowance has been estimates of future state taxable income 
such estimates can have material variations from year to year based upon expected levels of income from our ethanol plants  leasing income and gains on real estate sales 
factors that could negatively affect future taxable income include adverse changes in the commercial real estate market and the ethanol crush spread 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in the accounting estimates 
as of january   total unrecognized tax benefits were approximately million  and accrued penalties and interest were approximately million 
if we were to prevail on all unrecognized tax benefits recorded  approximately million of the reserve would benefit the effective tax rate 
in addition  the impact of penalties and interest would also benefit the effective tax rate 
interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits are recorded within income tax expense 
it is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit with respect to certain unrecognized tax positions will increase or decrease during the next months  however  we do not expect the change to have a material effect on results of operations or financial position 
on a quarterly and annual basis  we accrue for the effects of open uncertain tax positions and the related potential penalties and interest 
should future estimates of open uncertain tax positions differ from our current estimates  we could be required to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
in addition  new income tax audit findings could also require us to make a material change to our accrual for uncertain tax positions 
recoverability of long lived assets given the nature of our business  events and changes in circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decline in our estimated future cash flows  a sustained decline in market prices for similar assets  or a significant adverse change in legal or regulatory factors or the business climate 
a significant decline in our estimated future cash flows is represented by a greater than annual decline in expected future cash flows for asset groups in our real estate reportable segment or a change in the spread between ethanol and grain prices that would indicate or result in greater than six consecutive months of estimated or actual negative cash flows for asset groups in our alternative energy reportable segment 
we test for recoverability of an asset group by comparing its carrying amount to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the asset group s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  if any 
we generally determine the fair value of the asset group using a discounted cash flow model based on market participant assumptions for income producing asset groups or by obtaining appraisals based on the market approach and comparable market transactions for non income producing asset groups 
in our real estate reportable segment  each individual real estate property represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
as such  we separately test individual real estate properties for recoverability 
our real estate reportable segment includes both income producing and non income producing asset groups 
in our alternative energy reportable segment  each individual ethanol plant represents the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
as such  we separately test individual ethanol plants for recoverability 
in addition to the general events and changes in circumstances noted above that indicate that an asset group may not be recoverable  we also consider the following events as indicators the decision to suspend operations at a plant for at least a six month period  or an expected or actual failure to maintain compliance with debt covenants at our ethanol plants 
our alternative energy reportable segment includes only income producing asset groups 
new accounting pronouncements effective february   we adopted the third phase of amended guidance in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the amended guidance clarifies the application of existing fair value measurement requirements and requires additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
the adoption of this amended guidance impacted additional disclosure 
effective january   we adopted the amended guidance in asc topic  comprehensive income 
this accounting standards update increases the prominence of other comprehensive income in the financial statements by eliminating the option to present other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we have elected to present net income and other comprehensive income in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated presentation  which has been implemented retroactively for all comparable periods presented  did not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
effective february   we will adopt the amended guidance in asc topic  balance sheet 
the amended guidance addresses disclosure of offsetting financial assets and liabilities 
it requires entities to add disclosures showing both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the balance sheet and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the updated disclosures will be implemented retrospectively and will not impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
there were no other new accounting standards issued during fiscal year that had or are expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations associated with interest rates and commodity prices as discussed below 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from holding term and revolving loans that bear variable interest rates 
specifically  we have approximately million in variable rate debt as of january  of this amount  approximately million is fixed by an interest rate swap 
interest rates on our variable rate debt are determined based upon the market interest rate of libor plus to basis points 
a adverse change for example from to in market interest rates would increase our interest cost on such debt by approximately million over the term of the debt 
however  this change would be greater should libor rates exceed  which is the floor interest rate of the nugen subsidiary level long term debt 
one earth entered into a forward interest rate swap in the notional amount of million with the first national bank of omaha during fiscal year this swap fixed the variable interest rate of a portion of one earth s term loan at 
the swap settlements commenced on july   the swap terminates on july  a hypothetical change for example  from to in market interest rates at january  would change the fair value of the interest rate swap by approximately million 
commodity price risk we manage a portion of our risk with respect to the volatility of commodity prices inherent in the ethanol industry by using forward purchase and sale contracts 
at january   one earth and nugen combined have purchase commitments for approximately million bushels of corn  the principal raw material for their ethanol plants 
one earth and nugen expect to take delivery of the corn by may one earth and nugen have combined sales commitments for approximately million gallons of ethanol   tons of distillers grains and million pounds of non food grade corn oil 
one earth and nugen expect to deliver the ethanol  distillers grains and non food grade corn oil by april less than of our forecasted ethanol sales during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of ethanol from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining forecasted ethanol sales 
approximately of our forecasted distillers grains sales during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of distillers grains from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining forecasted distillers grains sales 
approximately of our forecasted non food grade corn oil sales during the next months have been sold under fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of non food grade corn oil from the current pricing would result in a decrease in annual revenues of approximately million for the remaining forecasted non food grade corn oil sales 
similarly  approximately of our estimated corn usage for the next month was subject to fixed price contracts 
as a result  the effect of a adverse move in the price of corn for current pricing would result in an increase in annual cost of goods sold of approximately million for the remaining forecasted corn usage
