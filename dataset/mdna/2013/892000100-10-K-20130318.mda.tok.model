overview we provide fixed wireless broadband services to commercial customers and deliver access over a wireless network transmitting over both regulated and unregulated radio spectrum 
our service supports bandwidth on demand  wireless redundancy  virtual private networks vpns  disaster recovery  bundled data and video services 
we provide service to approximately  business customers in new york city  boston  chicago  los angeles  san francisco  seattle  miami  dallas fort worth  philadelphia  nashville  las vegas reno and providence newport 
in february  we acquired delos internet which expands our service coverage into houston  texas 
since  we have been exploring opportunities to leverage our fixed wireless network in major urban markets to provide other wireless technology solutions and services 
over the past few years  a significant increase in mobile data generated by smartphones  tablets  and other devices has placed tremendous demand on the networks of the carriers 
this has caused the carriers to explore a wide range of solutions including i acquiring additional spectrum  ii employing wi fi to offload data traffic  and iii utilizing small cell technologies to increase capacity in dense urban areas 
during this period  we have incurred various costs related to identifying possible new solutions and services 
these costs included a rent payments under lease agreements which provide the right to install wireless technology equipment on street level rooftops  b construction of a carrier class network to offload data traffic  and c installation of relay points of presence pops to connect our offload network to our fixed wireless network 
we entered into the lease agreements and commenced these capital projects for the purpose of securing capacity that we believe we needed to maintain our competitive advantage in the wireless industry 
in recent months  the company has concluded that the wireless communications industry is experiencing a fundamental shift from its current  macro cellular architecture to hyper densified small cell architecture where existing cell sites will be supplemented by many smaller base stations operating near street level 
the company also believes that wi fi will be an integral component of small cell architecture 
in april  we completed the acquisition of the customer relationships  network infrastructure and related assets of the chicago  illinois and nashville  tennessee networks of sparkplug chicago  inc sparkplug

in august  we entered into a binding merger agreement with delos internet delos pursuant to which a wholly owned subsidiary of ours would be merged with and into delos  with delos becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
delos operates in houston  texas 
we closed the acquisition of delos in february characteristics of our revenues and expenses we offer our fixed wireless broadband services under agreements having terms of one  two or three years 
pursuant to these agreements  we bill customers on a monthly basis  in advance  for each month of service 
payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized as revenue ratably over the service period 
costs of revenues consists of expenses that are directly related to providing services to our customers  including core network expenses tower and roof rent and utilities  bandwidth costs  pop maintenance and other and customer network expenses customer maintenance  non installation fees and other customer specific expenses 
we collectively refer to core network and customer network as our network  and core network costs and customer network costs as network costs 
when we first enter a new market  or expand in an existing market  we are required to incur up front costs in order to be able to provide wireless broadband services to commercial customers 
we refer to these activities as establishing a network presence 
these costs include building pops which are company locations where we install a substantial amount of equipment in order to connect numerous customers to the internet 
the costs to build pops are capitalized and expensed over a five year period 
in addition to building pops  we also enter tower and roof rental agreements  secure bandwidth and incur other network costs 
once we have established a network presence in a new market or expanded our network presence in an existing market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers through that network presence 
the variable cost to add new customers is relatively modest  especially compared to the upfront cost of establishing or expanding our network presence 
as a result  our gross margins in a market normally increase over time as we add new customers in that market 
however  we may experience variability in gross margins during periods in which we are expanding our network presence in a market 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel and other costs of our sales and marketing teams  as well as marketing initiatives and business development expenses 
customer support services include salaries and related payroll costs associated with our customer support services  customer care  and installation and operations staff 
general and administrative expenses include costs attributable to corporate overhead and the overall support of our operations 
salaries and other related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include office rent  utilities and other facilities costs  accounting  legal and other professional services  and other general operating expenses 
market information we operate in one segment which is the business of fixed wireless broadband services 
although we provide services in multiple markets  these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets  including the nature of the services provided and the type of customers purchasing such services 
while we operate in only one business segment  we recognize that providing information on the revenues and costs of operating in each market can provide useful information to investors regarding our operating performance 
as of december   we operated in twelve markets across the united states including new york  boston  los angeles  chicago  san francisco  miami  seattle  dallas fort worth  philadelphia  nashville  las vegas reno and providence newport 
the markets were launched at different times  and as a result  may have different operating metrics based on their size and stage of maturation 
we incur significant up front costs in order to establish a network presence in a new market 
these costs include building pops and network costs 
other material costs include hiring and training sales and marketing personnel who will be dedicated to securing customers in that market 
once we have established a network presence in a new market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers 
the rate of customer additions varies from market to market  and we are unable to predict how many customers will be added in a market during any specific period 
we believe that providing operating information regarding each of our markets provides useful information to shareholders in understanding the leveraging potential of our business model  the operating performance of our mature markets  and the long term potential for our newer markets 
set forth below is a summary of our operating performance on a per market basis  and a description of how each category is determined 
revenues revenues are allocated based on which market each customer is located in 
costs of revenues includes payroll  core network costs and customer network costs that can be allocated to a specific market 
costs that cannot be allocated to a specific market are classified as centralized costs 
operating costs costs which can be specifically allocated to a market include direct sales personnel  certain direct marketing expense  certain customer support and installation payroll expenses and third party commissions 
centralized costs represents costs incurred to support activities across all of our markets that are not allocable to a specific market 
this principally consists of payroll costs for customer care representatives  customer support engineers  sales support  marketing and certain installations personnel 
these individuals service customers across all markets rather than being dedicated to any specific market 
corporate expenses includes costs attributable to corporate overhead and the overall support of our operations 
salaries and related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include office rent  utilities and other facilities costs  professional services and other general operating expenses 
non core expenses represent those operating costs that are not related to the operation of our primary business of providing fixed wireless services to businesses 
these costs relate to our efforts to develop other wireless technology solutions and services  and primarily consist of rent payments for street level rooftops  costs associated with constructing an offload network and payroll costs for employees working on these projects 
adjusted market ebitda represents a market s net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  and other income expense 
we believe this metric provides useful information regarding the cash flow being generated in a market

there were monthly payments of  remaining as of december  other 
in december  we entered into a one year information technology infrastructure support agreement 
the agreement became effective at the end of the first quarter of the monthly payments are approximately  and will be paid through the first quarter of impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions pricing for many technology products and services have historically decreased over time due to the effect of product and process improvements and enhancements 
in addition  economic conditions can affect the buying patterns of customers 
in  the core business continued to grow and benefit from a slowly improving economy 
customers  in general  were more willing to make a purchase compared to however they continued to place a premium on value and performance 
pricing of services continued to be a focus for prospective buyers with multi point and midrange product pricing remaining steady while competition for high capacity links intensified 
in part  pressure on high capacity links was due to decreased costs for equipment and some competitors willing to sacrifice margins 
we believe that our customers will continue to upgrade their bandwidth service 
the continued migration of many business activities and functions to the internet  and growing use of cloud computing should also result in increased bandwidth requirements over the long term 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the amounts of revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the financial statements  we utilize available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments  giving appropriate consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to other companies in our industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation  or are fundamentally important to our business 
revenue recognition 
we normally enter into contractual agreements with our customers for periods ranging between one to three years 
we recognize the total revenue provided under a contract ratably over the contract period including any periods under which we have agreed to provide services at no cost 
deferred revenues are recognized as a liability when billings are issued in advance of the date when revenues are earned 
we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or installation has been completed  iii the customer accepts and verifies receipt  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
long lived assets with definite lives consist primarily of property and equipment  and intangible assets such as acquired customer relationships 
long lived assets are evaluated periodically for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
conditions that would result in an impairment charge include a significant decline in the fair value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
when such events or circumstances arise  an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if impairment exists 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or net realizable value 
business acquisitions 
business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method 
the cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration transferred on the acquisition date 
when we acquire a business  we assess the acquired assets and liabilities assumed for the appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms  economic circumstances and pertinent conditions at the acquisition date 
the excess of the total consideration transferred over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
if the total consideration is lower than the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired  the difference is recognized as a gain on business acquisition 
acquisition costs are expensed and included in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
the highest level of judgment and estimation involved in accounting for business acquisitions relates to determining the fair value of the customer relationship and network assets acquired 
in each of the four acquisitions completed over the past three years  the highest asset value has been allocated to the customer relationship acquired 
determining the fair value of customer relationships involves judgments and estimates regarding how long the customers will continue to contract services with us 
during the course of completing four acquisitions  we have developed a database of historical experience from prior acquisitions to assist us in preparing future estimates of cash flows 
similarly  we have used our historical experience in building networks to prepare estimates regarding the fair value of the networks assets that we acquire 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we initially perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill which considers macro economic conditions  industry and market trends  and the current and projected financial performance of the reporting unit 
no further analysis is required if it is determined that there is a less than percent likelihood that the carrying value is greater than the fair value 
asset retirement obligations 
the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on asset retirement obligations addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated costs 
this guidance requires the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
our network equipment is installed on both buildings in which we have a lease agreement company locations and at customer locations 
in both instances  the installation and removal of our equipment is not complicated and does not require structural changes to the building where the equipment is installed 
costs associated with the removal of our equipment at company or customer locations are not material  and accordingly  we have determined that we do not presently have asset retirement obligations under the fasb s accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purposes entities 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu  to simplify how entities test indefinite lived intangibles assets for impairment

this pronouncement becomes effective for annual and interim tests performed for the fiscal years beginning after september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
