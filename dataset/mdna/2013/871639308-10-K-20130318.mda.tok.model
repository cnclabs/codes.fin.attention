our product development efforts are thus in their early stages and we cannot make estimates of the costs or the time they will take to complete 
the risk of completion of any program is high because of the many uncertainties involved in bringing new drugs to market including the long duration of clinical testing  the specific performance of proposed products under stringent clinical trial protocols  the extended regulatory approval and review cycles  our ability to raise additional capital  the nature and timing of research and development expenses and competing technologies being developed by organizations with significantly greater resources
