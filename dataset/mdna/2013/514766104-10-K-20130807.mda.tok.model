except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this report are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
potential risks and uncertainties include  without limitation  those mentioned in this report and  in particular  the factors described in item a 
risk factors 
landec undertakes no obligation to revise any forward looking statements in order to reflect events or circumstances that may arise after the date of this report 
overview since its inception in october  the company has been engaged in the research and development of its intelimer technology and related products 
the company has launched four product lines from this core development quickcast splints and casts in april  which was subsequently sold to bissell healthcare corporation in august  breatheway packaging technology for the fresh cut and whole produce packaging market in september  intelimer polymer systems that includes polymer materials for various industrial applications in june and for personal care applications in november  and intellicoat coated corn seeds in the fall of in addition  in april  the company acquired lifecore which develops and manufactures products utilizing hyaluronan  a naturally occurring polysaccharide that is widely distributed in the extracellular matrix of connective tissues in both animals and humans 
landec has three core businesses food products technology  food export  and ha based biomaterials 
the food products technology segment combines the company s breatheway packaging technology with apio s branded eat smart and greenline and private label fresh cut and whole produce business 
the food export business is operated through apio s cal ex export company which purchases and sells whole fruit and vegetable products to predominantly asian markets 
the ha based biomaterials business sells products utilizing ha in the ophthalmic  orthopedic and veterinary segments and also supplies ha to customers pursuing other medical applications  such as aesthetic surgery  medical device coatings  tissue engineering and pharmaceuticals 
see business description of core business 
as of may   the company s retained earnings were million 
the company may incur losses in the future 
the amount of future net profits  if any  is uncertain and there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain profitability in future years 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates that require management s most significant and subjective judgments include revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  the valuation of intangible assets and inventory  the valuation of investments  and the valuation and recognition of stock based compensation 
these estimates involve the consideration of complex factors and require management to make judgments 
the analysis of historical and future trends can require extended periods of time to resolve  and are subject to change from period to period 
the actual results may differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on review of the overall condition of accounts receivable balances and review of significant past due accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
if the cost of the inventories exceeds their expected market value  provisions are recorded currently for the difference between the cost and the market value 
these provisions are determined based on specific identification for unusable inventory and an additional reserve  based on historical losses  for inventory currently considered to be usable 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances are established for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  and discounts based on specific identification and historical losses 
the company takes title to all produce it trades and or packages  and therefore  records revenues and cost of sales at gross amounts in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
licensing revenue is recognized in accordance with prevailing accounting guidance 
initial license fees are deferred and amortized to revenue over the period of the agreement when a contract exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
noncancellable  nonrefundable license fees are recognized over the period of the agreement  including those governing research and development activities and any related supply agreement entered into concurrently with the license when the risk associated with commercialization of a product is non substantive at the outset of the arrangement 
contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as earned  based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and there is no continuing involvement by the company  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  the company allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy 
the relative selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  if available  third party evidence tpe  if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the company then recognizes revenue on each deliverable in accordance with its policies for product and service revenue recognition 
the company is not typically able to determine vsoe or tpe  and therefore  uses estimated selling prices to allocate revenue between the elements of the arrangement 
the company limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or future performance obligations or subject to customer specific cancellation rights 
the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value  and for an arrangement that includes a general right of return relative to the delivered products or services  delivery or performance of the undelivered product or service is considered probable and is substantially controlled by the company 
the company considers a deliverable to have stand alone value if the product or service is sold separately by the company or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  the revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 
where the aforementioned criteria for a separate unit of accounting are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered element s and treated as a single unit of accounting for the purposes of allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition 
the company allocates the total arrangement consideration to each separable element of an arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each element 
allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit s relative selling price 
in instances where the company has not established fair value for any undelivered element  revenue for all elements is deferred until delivery of the final element is completed and all recognition criteria are met 
goodwill and other intangibles the company s intangible assets are comprised of customer relationships with an estimated useful life of twelve to thirteen years and trademarks trade names and goodwill with indefinite lives collectively  intangible assets  which the company recognized in accordance with accounting guidance i upon the acquisition of greenline by apio in april  ii upon the acquisition of lifecore in april and iii upon the acquisition of apio in december accounting guidance defines goodwill as the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at date of acquisition 
all intangible assets  including goodwill  associated with the acquisition of lifecore was allocated to our ha based biomaterials reporting unit and the acquisitions of apio and greenline were allocated to our food products technology reporting unit pursuant to accounting guidance based upon the allocation of assets and liabilities acquired and consideration paid for each reporting unit 
as of may   the ha based biomaterials reporting unit had million of goodwill and the food products technology reporting unit had million of goodwill 
the company tests its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  in accordance with accounting guidance 
for non goodwill indefinite lived assets  the company performs a qualitative analysis in accordance with asc for goodwill  the company performs a quantitative analysis in accordance with asc application of the impairment tests for indefinite lived intangible assets requires significant judgment by management  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of intangible assets to reporting units  and the determination of the fair value of each indefinite lived intangible asset and reporting unit based upon projections of future net cash flows  discount rates and market multiples  which judgments and projections are inherently uncertain 
the company tested its indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of july  and determined that no adjustments to the carrying values of these assets were necessary as of that date 
on a quarterly basis  the company considers the need to update its most recent annual tests for possible impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets  based on management s assessment of changes in its business and other economic factors since the most recent annual evaluation 
such changes  if significant or material  could indicate a need to update the most recent annual tests for impairment of the indefinite lived intangible assets during the current period 
the results of these tests could lead to write downs of the carrying values of these assets in the current period 
the company uses the discounted cash flow dcf approach to develop an estimate of fair value for goodwill 
the dcf approach recognizes that current value is premised on the expected receipt of future economic benefits 
indications of value are developed by discounting projected future net cash flows to their present value at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the market approach is not used to value the company s reporting units the reporting units because insufficient market comparables exist to enable the company to develop a reasonable fair value of its intangible assets due to the unique nature of each of the company s reporting units 
the dcf approach requires the company to exercise judgment in determining future business and financial forecasts and the related estimates of future net cash flows 
future net cash flows depend primarily on future product sales  which are inherently difficult to predict 
these net cash flows are discounted at a rate that reflects both the current return requirements of the market and the risks inherent in the specific investment 
the dcf associated with the annual goodwill impairment analysis for the food products technology reporting unit is based on management s five year projection of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of the food products technology reporting unit and the industry categories in which it operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the estimated fair value of the food products technology reporting unit as of july  was of its book value at that date  therefore  no goodwill impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was million for the food products technology reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was million 
the difference of million was primarily due to the timing of working capital changes 
the dcf associated with the annual goodwill impairment analysis for the ha based biomaterials reporting unit is based on management s five year projections of revenues  gross profits and operating profits by fiscal year and assumes a effective tax rate for each year 
management takes into account the historical trends of ha based biomaterials reporting unit and the industry categories in which it operates along with inflationary factors  current economic conditions  new product introductions  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital requirements and other relevant data when developing its projection 
the trade name intangible asset was valued using the relief from royalty valuation method and the customer relationship intangible asset was valued using the multi period excess earnings method 
the fair value of goodwill was calculated as the excess of consideration paid  including the fair value of contingent consideration under the terms of the purchase agreement  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
the company updated its analysis of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets as of its annual impairment analysis date  concluding that the fair value of the ha based biomaterials reporting unit  as determined by the dcf approach  was of its book value at that date  therefore  no goodwill impairment was deemed to exist 
for the test performed as of july   the projected cash flow from operations for determining the dcf for fiscal year was million for the ha based biomaterials reporting unit 
the actual cash flow from operations for fiscal year was million 
the difference of million is primarily due to timing of working capital changes 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with accounting guidance which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
the company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the company s income tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  the company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
at may   the company had a valuation allowance of  against deferred tax assets 
in addition to valuation allowances  the company establishes accruals for uncertain tax positions 
the tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
the company s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals as considered appropriate by management 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has accrued  is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies by jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company believes its tax contingency accruals are adequate to address known tax contingencies 
favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to the company s effective tax rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate 
any resolution of a tax issue may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the company s tax contingency accruals are presented in the balance sheet within accrued liabilities 
stock based compensation the company s stock based awards include stock option grants and restricted stock unit awards rsus 
the estimated fair value for stock options  which determines the company s calculation of compensation expense  is based on the black scholes pricing model 
in addition  the accounting guidance requires the estimation of the expected forfeitures of stock based awards at the time of grant 
as a result  the company uses historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and records stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest and revises those estimates in subsequent periods if the actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates 
fair value measurements the company uses fair value measurement accounting for financial assets and liabilities and for financial instruments and certain other items measured at fair value 
the company has elected the fair value option for its investment in a non public company see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not elected the fair value option for any of its other eligible financial assets or liabilities 
the accounting guidance established a three tier hierarchy for fair value measurements  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly through corroboration with observable market data 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which would require the company to develop its own assumptions 
as of may   the company held certain assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis  including cash equivalents  marketable securities  interest rate swap and its minority interest investment in windset 
the fair value of the company s marketable securities is determined based on observable inputs that are readily available in public markets or can be derived from information available in publicly quoted markets 
therefore  the company has categorized its marketable securities as a level measurement 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap is determined based on model inputs that can be observed in a liquid market  including yield curves  and is categorized as a level measurement 
the fair value of the company s liability for contingent consideration as of may  was based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represented a level measurement 
the company determined the fair value of the liability for the contingent consideration as of may   based on a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has elected the fair value option of accounting for its investment in windset 
the calculation of fair value utilizes significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models  including projected cash flows  growth rates and discount rates 
as a result  the company s investment in windset is considered to be a level measurement investment 
the change in the fair market value of the company s investment in windset for the fiscal years ended may  and may  was due to the company s minority interest in the change in the fair market value of windset during those periods 
in determining the fair value of the investment in windset  the company utilizes the following significant unobservable inputs in the discounted cash flow models at may  at may  revenue growth rates to to expense growth rates to to income tax rates discount rates to to the revenue growth  expense growth and income tax rate assumptions  consider the company best estimate of the trends in those items over the discount period 
the discount rate assumption takes into account the risk free rate of return  the market equity risk premium and the company s specific risk premium and then applies an additional discount for lack of liquidity of the underlying securities 
the discounted cash flow valuation model used by the company has the following sensitivity to changes in inputs and assumptions in thousands impact on value of windset investment as of may  increase in revenue growth rates increase in expense growth rates increase in income tax rates increase in discount rates imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs can affect the amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular position 
the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date 
the following table summarizes the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis  as of may  and may  in thousands fair value at may  fair value at may  assets level level level level level level marketable securities investment in private company total liabilities contingent consideration interest rate swap total recent accounting pronouncements intangibles goodwill and other in september  the fasb issued new guidance that will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill and intangibles impairment test 
under this amendment  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the amendment includes a number of events and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted this standard beginning in fiscal year and the adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
presentation of comprehensive income in december  the fasb issued new guidance that improves the comparability  consistency  and transparency of financial reporting and increases the prominence of items reported in other comprehensive income by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this standard require that all non owner changes in stockholders equity be presented either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
under either method  adjustments must be displayed for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income oci to net income  in both net income and oci 
the standard does not change the current option for presenting components of oci gross or net of the effect of income taxes  provided that such tax effects are presented in the statement in which oci is presented or disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
additionally  the standard does not affect the calculation or reporting of earnings per share 
for public entities  the amendments in this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  and are to be applied retrospectively  with early adoption permitted 
the company retrospectively adopted this standard beginning in fiscal year fair value measurement in may  the fasb issued new guidance effective for annual reporting periods beginning after december  this guidance amends certain accounting and disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
additional disclosure requirements in the update include for level fair value measurements  quantitative information about unobservable inputs used  a description of the valuation processes used by the entity  and a qualitative discussion about the sensitivity of the measurements to changes in the unobservable inputs  for an entity s use of a nonfinancial asset that is different from the asset s highest and best use  the reason for the difference  for financial instruments not measured at fair value but for which disclosure of fair value is required  the fair value hierarchy level in which the fair value measurements were determined  and the disclosure of all transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy 
the company adopted this standard beginning in fiscal year disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in november  the fasb issued new guidance effective for annual reporting periods beginning january  this guidance amends the disclosure requirements around offsetting to enable users of the financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
entities are required to disclose both gross and net information about the instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement 
the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

in addition  value added revenues include the revenues generated from apio cooling  lp  a vegetable cooling operation in which apio is the general partner with a ownership position and from the sale of breatheway packaging to license partners 
the increase in apio food products technology revenues for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the following factors a million increase in non green bean value added sales due to a increase in unit volume sales to existing non green bean customers resulting primarily from expanded product offerings  gaining additional distribution locations and growth in the fresh cut vegetable category  an million increase in revenues from greenline which was acquired on april  and a larger percentage of apio non green bean value added sales volume being generated from sales to club stores rather than retail grocery chains 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by product mix changes in retail grocery chains to lower priced products from higher priced products 
food export apio apio s food export revenues consist of revenues generated from the purchase and sale of primarily whole commodity fruit and vegetable products to asia by cal ex 
apio records revenue equal to the sale price to third parties because it takes title to the product while in transit 
the increase in revenues in apio s food export business for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year was primarily due to more favorable pricing for export products in fiscal year compared to fiscal year resulting in higher prices per unit sold

lifecore primarily sells products to customers in three medical areas ophthalmic  which represented approximately of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year  orthopedic  which represented approximately of lifecore s revenues in fiscal year and veterinary other 
the increase in lifecore s revenues for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was almost entirely due to increased sales of existing aseptically filled products to existing customers and from new aseptically filled products recently approved by the fda to existing customers in the ophthalmic area 
corporate corporate revenues are generated from the licensing agreements with air products  nitta and incotec 
the decrease in corporate revenues for fiscal year compared to the same period of last year was due to the termination of the monsanto agreement at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the company recognized million in license fees from the monsanto agreement during fiscal year the monsanto license fees were partially offset by research and development revenues from nitta

these costs include the following raw materials including produce  seeds  packaging  syringes and fermentation and purification supplies  direct labor  overhead including indirect labor  depreciation  and facility related costs and shipping and shipping related costs 
the following are the primary reasons for the changes in gross profit for the fiscal year ended may  compared to the same period last year as outlined in the table above 
food products technology apio the increase in gross profit for the food products technology business for the fiscal year compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the increase in revenues and the addition of higher margin greenline products 
these increases were partially offset by the negative impact of produce sourcing issues which primarily occurred during the second half of fiscal year food export apio apio s export business is a buy sell business that typically realizes a gross margin in the range 
the increase in gross profit for apio s food export business for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a increase in revenues partially offset by higher procurement costs for certain export products 
ha based biomaterials lifecore lifecore operates in the higher margin medical devices industry and has historically realized an overall gross margin of approximately 
the increase in gross profit for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was due to an increase in revenues of million resulting from the increased sales of both historical products and new products to existing customers which were partially offset by the revenue increase from aseptically filled products which have a lower gross margin than lifecore s other products 
corporate the decrease in corporate gross profit for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was due to the termination of the monsanto agreement at the end of the second quarter of fiscal year the company recognized million in license fees from the monsanto agreement during fiscal year the monsanto license fees were partially offset by research and development revenues from nitta

for corporate  the research and development efforts are focused on supporting the development and commercialization of new products and new technologies in our food and ha businesses along with developing uses for our proprietary intelimer polymers outside of our food and ha businesses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the decrease in research and development expenses incurred by corporate during fiscal year at the company s former seed corn business which was sold in june selling  general and administrative s  g a selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing expenses associated with landec s product sales and services  business development expenses and staff and administrative expenses 
the increase in s  g a expenses for fiscal year compared to the same period last year was primarily due to a million increase in s  g a expenses at apio from greenline which was acquired on april  and a million increase in sg a at apio  excluding greenline  due to the amortization of the customer base intangible acquired in the acquisition of greenline and additional sales and marketing expenses associated with the increase in revenues

landec is not a party to any agreements with  or commitments to  any special purpose entities that would constitute material off balance sheet financing other than the operating lease commitments 
landec s future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of its research and development programs  the continued development of marketing  sales and distribution capabilities  the ability of landec to establish and maintain new collaborative and licensing arrangements  any decision to pursue additional acquisition opportunities  weather conditions that can affect the supply and price of produce  the timing and amount  if any  of payments received under licensing and research and development agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights  the ability to comply with regulatory requirements  the emergence of competitive technology and market forces  the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and arrangements  and other factors 
if landec s currently available funds  together with the internally generated cash flow from operations are not sufficient to satisfy its capital needs  landec would be required to seek additional funding through other arrangements with collaborative partners  additional bank borrowings and public or private sales of its securities 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to landec on favorable terms  if at all 
landec believes that its cash from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to finance its operational and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months
