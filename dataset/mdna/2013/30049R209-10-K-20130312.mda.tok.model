the current tax expense consists primarily of income tax from our uk based operations and income tax related to our operations in india and amt 
the majority of the uk income tax expense is related to unrecoverable foreign withholding taxes 
the foreign withholding taxes are typically used to offset our income tax liability  but we did not have enough taxable income to utilize the foreign withholding taxes during the year 
the deferred tax benefit was related primarily to the partial release of our valuation allowance on our domestic deferred tax assets during the second quarter of as a result of the anticipated gain on numbering solutions business which closed in the third quarter of we also had a deferred tax benefit related to the release of our valuation allowance on our tax asset from our indian operations as we began to utilize mat payments made during our tax holiday

the deferred tax benefit was related to intangible assets from our uk based operations and losses from continuing operations in the us in conjunction with the acquisition of evolving systems uk  we recorded certain identifiable intangible assets 
since the amortization of these identifiable intangibles is not deductible for income tax purposes  we established a long term deferred tax liability of million at the acquisition date for the expected difference between what would be expensed for financial reporting purposes and what would be deductible for income tax purposes 
as of december  and  this deferred tax liability was  and million  respectively 
the deferred tax liability relates to evolving systems uk and has no impact on our ability to recover the uk based deferred tax assets 
this deferred tax liability will be recognized as the identifiable intangibles are amortized 
we use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
as of december  and  we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
discontinued operations on july   we completed the sale of our numbering solutions business for million

the results of continuing operations were reduced by the revenue and costs associated with the business which are included in the income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in our consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents financial condition our working capital position of million at december  reflects an increase of million from our working capital position of million at december  our working capital position increased at december  despite million of cash dividends partly paid from cash and partly from the proceeds from the sale of million of long term investments not accrued as of december  the increase is primarily related to an increase in our contract receivables and unbilled work in progress balances and a reduction in our deferred revenue balance

the net cash provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of cash received from the exercise of stock options of million  offset by net payments of million to retire our senior term notes and pay off our uk revolving credit facility  and million for common stock dividends 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in making this assessment  we considered the following our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  of million  our working capital balance of million  our ability to generate positive operating cash flows  the declaration of our quarterly cash dividends of per share for the first  third and fourth quarters of  the special cash dividends of per share in the second quarter and per share in the fourth quarter and the possibility of future dividends  our backlog of approximately million  including million in license fees and services and million in customer support at december   and 
table of contents our planned capital expenditures of less than million during we are exposed to foreign currency rate risks which impact the carrying amount of our foreign subsidiaries and our consolidated equity  as well as our consolidated cash position due to translation adjustments 
for the years ended december   and  the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million   and  increase decrease to consolidated cash  respectively 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  but we closely monitor the rate changes and may hedge our exposures in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect  or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect  on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december   which are comprised of a capital lease and operating leases in thousands 
payments due by period total and thereafter capital lease operating leases total commitments critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when an agreement is signed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from two primary sources license fees and services  and customer support 
the majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed price contracts  which provide for licenses to our software products and services to customize such software to meet our customers use 
when the customization services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in these types of arrangements  we do not typically have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value on the license fee services portion services are related to customizing the software of the arrangement due to the large amount of customization required by our customers  however  we do have vsoe for the warranty maintenance services based on the renewal rate of the first year of maintenance in the arrangement 
the license services portion is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting and the warranty maintenance services are separated based on the renewal rate in the contract and recognized ratably over the warranty or maintenance period 
we estimate the percentage of completion for each contract based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours and recognize revenue based on the percent complete multiplied by the contract amount allocated to the license fee services 
since estimated direct labor hours  and changes thereto  can have a significant impact on revenue recognition  these estimates are critical and we review them regularly 
if the arrangement includes a customer acceptance provision  the hours to complete the acceptance testing are included in the total estimated direct labor hours  therefore  the related revenue is recognized as the acceptance testing is performed 
revenue is not recognized in full until the customer has provided proof of acceptance on the arrangement 
generally  our contracts are accounted for individually 
however  when certain criteria are met  it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 
we record amounts billed in advance of services being performed as unearned revenue 
unbilled work in progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed price contracts 
all such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within months 

table of contents we may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed price contracts caused by increased labor or overhead costs 
we make adjustments to cost estimates in the period in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
we record estimated losses  if any  in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
if revisions to cost estimates are obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the interim or annual financial statements  we make adjustments to the interim or annual financial statements accordingly 
in arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed  delivery and acceptance have occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
where applicable  we unbundle and record as revenue fees from multiple element arrangements as the elements are delivered to the extent that vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements exist 
if vsoe for the undelivered elements does not exist  we defer fees from such arrangements until the earlier of the date that vsoe does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered 
we recognize revenue from fixed price service contracts using the proportional performance method of accounting  which is similar to the percentage of completion method described above 
we recognize revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time and materials based contracts and training services as the services are performed  as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled 
we recognize customer support  including maintenance revenue  ratably over the service contract period 
when maintenance is bundled with the original license fee arrangement  its fair value  based upon vsoe  is deferred and recognized during the periods when services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments related to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for receivables when their collection becomes doubtful by recording an expense 
we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments owed to us  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance regularly and make adjustments accordingly 
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income projections  historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded 
such adjustments  if any  could have a material impact on our results of our operations 
we use a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the company uses the incremental approach to recognizing excess tax benefits associated with equity compensation 
as of december  and  we had no liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not believe there will be any material changes to our unrecognized tax positions over the next twelve months 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators may include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of july   at which time we had million of goodwill included in the following reporting units  license and services l s uk of million and customer support cs uk of million 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both market and income based approaches 
specifically  we incorporated observed market multiple data from selected guideline public companies and values arrived at through the application of discounted cash flow analyses which in turn were based upon our financial projections as of the valuation date 
we believe that a market participant would weigh both possibilities without a bias to one or the other 
consequently  we gave equal consideration to both 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we would then compare the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss 
if the projected future performance of either of our segments as estimated in the income valuation approach is adjusted downward or is lower than expected in the future  we could be required to record a goodwill impairment charge 
as a result of the first step of the goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
therefore the second step was not necessary 

table of contents intangible assets amortizable intangible assets consist primarily of purchased software and licenses  customer contracts and relationships  trademarks and tradenames  and business partnerships acquired in conjunction with our purchase of tertio telecoms ltd 
evolving systems uk 
these definite life assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated lives 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable  we compare the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the asset s carrying amount 
if an amortizable intangible or long lived asset is not deemed to be recoverable  we recognize an impairment loss representing the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
capitalization of internal software development costs we expend amounts on product development  particularly for new products and or for enhancements of existing products 
for internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us  we expense the cost of developing software prior to establishing technological feasibility and those costs are capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
capitalization ceases upon general release of the software 
the determination of whether internal software development costs are subject to capitalization is  by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
we did not capitalize any internal software development costs during the years ended december    or in addition  we did not have any capitalized internal software development costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software development costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software development efforts are of this nature  and therefore  we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation by applying a fair value based measurement method to account for share based payment transactions with employees and directors and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after january  and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
we record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
stock based compensation is a non cash expense because we settle these obligations by issuing shares of our common stock instead of settling such obligations with cash payments 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant
