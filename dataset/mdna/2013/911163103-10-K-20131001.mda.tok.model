overview we believe we are a leading national distributor based on sales of natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products in the united states and canada and that our twenty seven distribution centers  representing approximately million square feet of warehouse space  provide us with the largest capacity of any north american based distributor in the natural  organic and specialty products industry 
we offer more than  high quality natural  organic and specialty foods and non food products  consisting of national brands  regional brands  private label and master distribution products  in six product categories grocery and general merchandise  produce  perishables and frozen foods  nutritional supplements and sports nutrition  bulk and food service products and personal care items 
we serve more than  customer locations primarily located across the united states and canada  the majority of which can be classified into one of the following categories independently owned natural products retailers  which include buying clubs  supernatural chains  which consist solely of whole foods market  conventional supermarkets  which include mass market chains  and other which includes foodservice and international customers outside of canada 
our operations are comprised of three principal operating divisions 
these operating divisions are our wholesale division  which includes our broadline natural  organic and specialty distribution business in the united states  unfi canada  which is our natural  organic and specialty distribution business in canada  albert  which is a leading distributor of organically grown produce and non produce perishable items within the united states  and select nutrition  which distributes vitamins  minerals and supplements  our retail division  consisting of earth origins  which operates our thirteen natural products retail stores within the united states  and our manufacturing division  consisting of woodstock farms manufacturing  which specializes in the international importation  roasting  packaging and distribution of nuts  dried fruit  seeds  trail mixes  granola  natural and organic snack items  and confections  and our blue marble brands product lines 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our high quality service and a broader product selection  including specialty products  and the acquisition of  or merger with  natural and specialty products distributors  the expansion of our existing distribution centers  the construction of new distribution centers  the introduction of new products 
table of contents and the development of our own line of natural and organic branded products 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
we have been the primary distributor to whole foods market for more than fifteen years 
effective june  we amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market to extend the term of the agreement to september  under the terms of the amended agreement  we will continue to serve as the primary wholesale natural grocery distributor to whole foods market in its united states regions where we were serving as the primary distributor at the time of the amendment 
in september and october respectively  we acquired certain assets of whole foods distribution previously used for their self distribution of non perishables in their rocky mountain and southwest regions 
we now serve as the primary distributor to whole foods market in all of its regions in the united states and have amended our distribution agreement with whole foods market effective october to include these regions 
whole foods market accounted for approximately of our net sales for the years ended august  and july  in june  we acquired the sdg assets of sunopta through our wholly owned subsidiary  unfi canada for cash consideration of million 
with the acquisition  we became the largest distributor of natural  organic and specialty foods  including kosher foods  in canada 
this was a strategic acquisition as unfi canada provides us with an immediate platform for growth in the canadian market 
during fiscal  we utilized our unfi canada platform to further expand in the canadian market  including through our purchase of substantially all of the assets of a specialty food distribution business in the ontario market in november during the first quarter of fiscal  we also utilized this platform for our august acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a dairy distribution business in the central canada market 
the ability to distribute specialty food items including ethnic  kosher and gourmet has accelerated our expansion into a number of high growth business markets and allowed us to establish immediate market share in the fast growing specialty foods market 
we have now integrated specialty food products and natural and organic specialty non food products into most of our broadline distribution centers across the united states and canada 
due to our expansion into specialty foods  we were awarded new business with a number of conventional supermarkets over the past three fiscal years that we previously had not done business with because we did not distribute specialty products 
we believe that distribution of these products enhances our conventional supermarket business channel and that our complementary product lines continue to present opportunities for cross selling 
in june  we entered into an asset purchase agreement with l r distributors pursuant to which we agreed to sell our conventional non foods and general merchandise lines of business  including certain inventory related to these product lines 
this divestiture was completed in the first quarter of fiscal  and has allowed us to concentrate on our core business of the distribution of natural  organic  and specialty foods and non food products 
to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we seek to continually expand our marketing and customer service programs across regions  expand our national purchasing opportunities  offer a broader product selection  offer operational excellence with high service levels and a higher percentage of on time deliveries than our competitors  centralize general and administrative functions to reduce expenses  consolidate systems applications among physical locations and regions  increase our investment in people  facilities  equipment and technology  integrate administrative and accounting functions  and reduce the geographic overlap between regions 
our continued growth has allowed us to expand our existing facilities and open new facilities in an effort to achieve increasing operating efficiencies 
we have made significant capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the opening and expansion of our facilities 
at august   our distribution capacity totaled approximately million square feet 
in september  we began shipping products from our distribution center in lancaster  texas  which serves customers throughout the southwestern united states  including texas  oklahoma  new mexico  arkansas and louisiana 
in october  in connection with the acquisition of the rocky mountain distribution business of whole foods distribution  we took over the operations  including the assumption of an operating lease at a distribution center in aurora  
table of contents colorado  augmenting our existing aurora  colorado distribution center  which was at capacity  in serving customers in colorado  utah  arizona and new mexico 
in may  we began operations at our new  square foot distribution center in aurora  colorado  replacing our existing two broadline distribution centers  an albert distribution center and an off site storage location 
in may  we also began operations at our new albert distribution center in logan  new jersey 
we have also announced a multi year expansion project with additional distribution centers planned for the united states in racine  wisconsin in the village of sturtevant  hudson valley  new york in the town of montgomery as well as in northern california 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural  organic and specialty products to retailers  adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
net sales also consist of amounts charged by us to customers for shipping and handling and fuel surcharges 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amounts paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution centers 
cost of sales also includes amounts incurred by us at our manufacturing subsidiary  woodstock farms manufacturing  for inbound transportation costs and depreciation for manufacturing equipment  offset by consideration received from suppliers in connection with the purchase or promotion of the suppliers products 
our gross margin may not be comparable to other similar companies within our industry that may include all costs related to their distribution network in their costs of sales rather than as operating expenses 
we include purchasing and outbound transportation expenses within our operating expenses rather than in our cost of sales 
total operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  share based compensation  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on our outstanding indebtedness  including the financing obligation related to our aurora  colorado distribution center  interest income and miscellaneous income and expenses 
fiscal year other expense also includes a pre tax charge of million in the first quarter related to an agreement to settle a multi state unclaimed property audit 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies are i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts  ii determining our reserves for the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities and iii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of august  and july   respectively 
our notes receivable balances were million and million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  as of august  and july   respectively 
insurance reserves we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  and general and automobile liability insurance 
it is our policy to record the self insured portions of our workers compensation and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial methods of estimating the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for workers compensation and automobile liabilities totaled million and million as of august  and july   respectively 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
table of contents we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level  which are at or one level below the operating segment level 
beginning in fiscal  the first step in our annual assessment of each of our reporting units is a qualitative assessment as allowed under accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment asu  unless we believe it is more likely than not that a reporting unit fair value is less than the carrying value 
in order to qualify for an exclusion from the quantitative two step goodwill test  the thresholds used by the company for this determination are that a reporting unit must have passed its previous two step test with a margin of calculated fair value versus carrying value of at least  have had no significant changes to its working capital structure  and have current year income which is at least of prior year amounts 
for reporting units which do not meet this exclusion  the quantitative goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test 
the first step  used to identify potential impairment  involves comparing each reporting unit estimated fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
each reporting unit regularly prepares discrete operating forecasts and uses these forecasts as the basis for the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is considered not to be impaired 
if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value  there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment 
if required  the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated potential impairment 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination  by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  as determined in the first step  over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets  liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit  there is no impairment 
if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment charge is recorded for the excess 
as of august   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
approximately of our goodwill is within our wholesale reporting unit 
total goodwill as of august  and july  was million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired 
in accordance with asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu no 
 we analyzed several qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset was impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test 
impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
during fiscal  our long term plans related to the trade name of a portion of our canadian wholesale distribution business evolved  and we decided to phase out this trade name 
as a result  we began amortizing this trade name over a period of ten years 
as a result  our branded product line asset group is the only remaining indefinite lived intangible asset 
as of our most recent annual impairment review  the branded product line asset group was determined not to be impaired 
the qualitative factors used in the impairment assessment for the branded product line asset group included a review of the most recent quantitative impairment review through which we confirmed that fair value exceeded carrying value by at least and that pre tax operating income was at least of the prior year 
we believe these projections are reasonable based on our historical trends and expectation of future results 
total indefinite lived intangible assets as of august  and july  were million and million  respectively 
intangible assets with finite lives are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset useful life based on updated projections 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  the potential impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow model 
during the fiscal year ended august   an impairment charge of million was recognized in connection with the termination of a long term licensing agreement and the write off of the associated intangible asset 
total finite lived intangible assets as of august  and july  were million and million  respectively 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales 
table of contents fiscal year ended august  july  july  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment expenses total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense interest income other  net total other expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income total reflects rounding fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended august  increased approximately  or million  to a record billion from billion for the fiscal year ended july  this increase was primarily due to growth in our wholesale segment of million 
our organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions of is due to the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our focus on service and value added services  and a broader selection of products  including specialty foods 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in incremental net sales related to our acquisitions of certain assets of three distributors completed during the first quarter of fiscal our net sales for the fiscal year ended august  were also favorably impacted by approximately  or million  due to the addition of an extra week in the fiscal year compared to fiscal  and by moderate price inflation of approximately during the year 
our net sales by customer type for the years ended august  and july  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by approximately million  or during the year ended august  compared to the year ended july  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  and therefore represent a lower percentage of our total net sales compared to the prior year 
whole foods market is our only supernatural chain customer  and net sales to whole foods market for the year ended august  increased by approximately million or over the prior year and accounted for approximately of our total net sales for each of the years ended august  and july  the increase in sales to whole foods market is primarily due to the increases in same store sales  and to a lesser extent  the expanded primary distribution agreement noted above 

table of contents net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended august  increased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in net sales to conventional supermarkets is due to increased demand for our products  conventional supermarkets expanding the breadth of products carried in their stores  and the additional two months of sales in fiscal versus the ten months of sales in fiscal to a large national customer which we began servicing during the first quarter of fiscal other net sales  which include sales to foodservice and sales from the united states to countries other than canada  as well as sales through our retail division  manufacturing division  and our branded product lines  increased by approximately million or during the fiscal year ended august  over the prior fiscal year and accounted for approximately of total net sales in fiscal and fiscal the increase in other net sales was primarily driven by an increase in broadline distribution sales to foodservice customers 
as we continue to aggressively pursue new customers and as economic conditions continue to stabilize  we expect net sales for fiscal to grow over fiscal we believe that the integration of our specialty business into our national platform has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business and will continue to allow us to pursue a broader array of customers as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
we believe that our projected sales growth will come from both sales to new customers and an increase in the number of products that we sell to existing customers 
we expect that most of this sales growth will occur in our lower gross margin supernatural and conventional supermarket channels 
although sales to these customers typically generate lower gross margins than sales to customers within our independent retailer channel  they also typically carry a lower average cost to serve than sales to our independent customers 
we also believe that food price inflation similar to the levels experienced in fiscal will contribute to our projected net sales growth in fiscal cost of sales and gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended august  and for the year ended july  the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is primarily due to the continued change in the mix of net sales by channel that began during the second fiscal quarter of  as well as a reduced number of promotional opportunities driven by higher supplier out of stocks and the increased sales of customers private label brands  which carry a lower gross margin  combined with higher inbound freight costs 
our decision to maintain higher service levels despite greater supplier out of stocks also negatively impacted our gross margin in fiscal due to increased costs to move freight on an expedited basis and between our facilities 
our gross profits are generally higher on net sales to independently owned retailers and lower on net sales in the conventional supermarket and the supernatural channels 
for the year ended august  approximately million of our total net sales growth of million was from increased net sales in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels 
as a result  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal were to the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels compared to approximately in fiscal this change in sales mix from to resulted in lower gross profits as a percentage of net sales during fiscal than we experienced in fiscal we anticipate net sales growth in the conventional supermarket and supernatural channels will continue to outpace growth in the independent and other channels 
we expect that our growth with whole foods market and our opportunities in the conventional supermarket channel will continue to generate lower gross profit percentages than our historical rates  particularly during the time period when we are on boarding new business and incurring costs of hiring and training additional associates and increasing inventory levels before a new customer has reached expected purchasing levels 
we will seek to fully offset these reductions in gross profit percentages by reducing our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales primarily through improved efficiencies in our supply chain and improvements to our information technology infrastructure 
operating expenses our total operating expenses increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  the increase in total operating expenses for the year ended august  was primarily due to higher sales volume  approximately million in labor action related costs at our auburn  washington facility and approximately million related to the termination of a licensing agreement and write off of the associated intangible asset 
operating expenses for the year ended july  included million of severance and other restructuring expenses associated with the divestiture of our conventional non food and general merchandise lines of business and million in start up expenses incurred in connection with onboarding a large national conventional supermarket customer 
total operating expenses for fiscal include share based compensation expense of million  compared to million in fiscal share based compensation expense for the years ended august  and july  includes 
table of contents approximately million and million  respectively  in expense related to performance share based awards granted to our chief executive officer related to certain financial goals for those years ended august  and july  the company recorded million and million for the years ended august  and july   respectively  related to performance based equity compensation arrangements with a year performance based vesting component that was established for members of our executive leadership team 
see note equity plans to our consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data of this annual report on form k 
as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses decreased to approximately for the year ended august   from approximately for the year ended july  the decrease in total operating expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to the growth in the supernatural and conventional supermarket channels which in general have lower operating expenses and higher fixed cost coverage due to higher sales  as well as expense control programs across all of our divisions 
our operating expenses as a percentage of net sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by million in labor action related costs at our auburn  washington facility and approximately million related to the termination of a licensing agreement and write off of the associated intangible asset 
we were able to manage our fuel costs despite rising prices by locking in the price of a portion of our expected fuel usage  updating and revising existing routes to reduce miles traveled and optimize use of trailer space  reducing idle times and other similar measures 
we expect that we will be able to continue to reduce our operating expenses as we continue the roll out of our supply chain initiatives including a national warehouse management and procurement system  which was first launched in the lancaster  texas facility in september  launched in the ridgefield  washington facility in july and is expected to be rolled out in all of our existing  broadline distribution centers by the end of fiscal operating income operating income increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating income was for the year ended august  compared to for the year ended july  the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to sales growth and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during fiscal compared to fiscal other expense income other expense income increased million to million for the year ended august   from million for the year ended july  other expense for the year ended august  includes a pre tax charge of million related to an agreement to settle a multi state unclaimed property audit 
interest expense for the year ended august  increased to million from million in the year ended july  primarily due to million of non cash interest expense related to the aurora  colorado facility as we are accounting for this facility under the financing method due to our meeting the criteria for continuing involvement in this sale leaseback transaction 
interest income for the year ended august  decreased to million from million in the year ended july  provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended august  and july   respectively 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was impacted by a net benefit for the reversal of uncertain tax positions for the year ended august   and one time tax credits associated with a renewable energy project in moreno valley  california 
our effective income tax rate in both fiscal years was also affected by increased state taxes resulting from the states in which we operate 
net income reflecting the factors described in more detail above  net income increased million to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended august   compared to million  or per diluted share for the year ended july  fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  net sales our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  increased approximately  or million  to billion from billion for the fiscal year ended july  this increase was primarily due to growth in our wholesale segment of million  which includes net sales from a national conventional supermarket customer that began shipping in october and the strong performance of our unfi canada division 
our organic growth sales growth excluding the impact of acquisitions was due to the continued growth of the natural and organic products industry in general  increased market share as a result of our 
table of contents focus on service and value added services  and a broader selection of products  including specialty foods 
we believe that the integration of our specialty business has allowed us to attract customers that we would not have been able to attract without that business as many customers seek a single source for their natural  organic and specialty products 
our net sales for the fiscal year ended july  were also favorably impacted by moderate price inflation 
in addition to net sales growth attributable to our organic growth  we also benefited from the inclusion of million in incremental net sales resulting from expanded distribution to whole foods market during fiscal following the acquisition of the southwest and rocky mountain distribution business of whole foods distribution and expanded distribution agreement with whole foods market in the first quarter of fiscal and approximately million in sales resulting from our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of a specialty food distribution business in the ontario market in november our net sales by customer type for the years ended july  and july  were as follows in millions customer type net sales of total net sales net sales of total net sales independently owned natural products retailers supernatural chains conventional supermarkets other total net sales to our independent retailer channel increased by approximately million  or during the year ended july  compared to the year ended july  while net sales in this channel have increased  they have grown at a slower rate than net sales in our supernatural and conventional supermarket channels  and therefore represent a lower percentage of our total net sales in fiscal compared to the prior year

net sales to conventional supermarkets for the year ended july  increased by approximately million  or from fiscal and represented approximately of total net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in net sales to conventional supermarkets was primarily due to a large national customer which we began servicing during the first quarter of fiscal  as part of our strategy to be the sole supplier of natural  organic and specialty products to our conventional supermarket customers
