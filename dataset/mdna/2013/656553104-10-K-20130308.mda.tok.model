item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a wayzata  minnesota based full service ems contract manufacturer of wire and cable assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  higher level assemblies and box builds for a wide range of industries 
we serve three major markets within the ems industry aerospace and defense  medical  and the industrial market which includes industrial equipment  transportation  vision  agriculture  oil and gas 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  mankato  merrifield  milaca and wayzata 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin and monterrey  mexico 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products built to the customer design specifications following a wide range of manufacturing process  from simple to highly complex 
during  we continued our supply chain and lean manufacturing initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our initiatives focused on improving quality and on time delivery as well as improving our manufacturing processes and yields by doing it right the first time 
our goal is to expand and diversify our customer base by focusing on sales and marketing efforts that fit our value added service strategy 
our mexico operation allows for lower cost production alternatives when the opportunities are presented 

table of contents our net sales in were million  a decrease of compared to the lower revenue was largely caused by shortfalls in sales and orders from our existing industrial customers that are being hit the hardest by the uncertainty in the economy 
our customers are still wary about carrying large amounts of inventory and their ability to accurately forecast future demand 
our day backlog at december  was million  compared to million at the end of total backlog was flat but there were significant fluctuations within the medical and industrial markets 
medical backlog was up  defense backlog was relatively flat  down only  and industrial backlog was down 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the underutilization of plant capacity and lower volume  largely offset by favorable product mix and cost reductions 
income from operations totaled million for the years ended december  and our net income in was million or per diluted common share 
net income totaled million or per diluted common share in  million or per diluted common share excluding the bargain purchase gain of million  net of tax  resulting from the winland acquisition 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the cash provided in came from profits  depreciation  a strong collection year in accounts receivables and a reduction in inventory spending compared to the prior year 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended was million 
the cash used in was needed to fund the working capital needs of our winland acquisition  including significant inventory purchases 
we believe our financing arrangements and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs through the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical estimates that require significant judgment are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of manufactured products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we also provide engineering services separate from the manufacture of a product 
revenue for engineering services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  providing standalone fair value to our customers 
our engineering services are short term in nature 
in addition  we have another separate source of revenue that comes from short term repair services  which are recognized upon completion of the repairs  and the repaired products are shipped back to the customer 
shipping and handling costs charged to our customers are included in net sales  while the corresponding shipping expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
allowance for doubtful accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on outstanding accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of accounts receivable  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have historically not experienced significant bad debts expense and believe the reserve is adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 

table of contents inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we evaluate our inventory based on current usage and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we believe the total reserve at december  is adequate 
long lived asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets  primarily property and equipment  as well as the related amortization periods  whenever current events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability for assets to be held and used is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge might be required to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to dispose 
we recorded impairment charges in and of  and  respectively 
the impairment charges in and relate to buildings held for sale in fairmont  mn 
valuation allowance we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary 
realization of deferred tax assets such as state net operating loss carry forwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against these assets  thereby increasing income tax expense or decreasing the income tax benefit in the period the determination is made 
as of december   we expect to recover our deferred tax assets in their entirety  and thus no valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting estimates and the underlying judgments and uncertainties of those estimates  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially 
operating results the following table presents our statements of income data as percentages of net sales for the indicated year net sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling expenses general and administrative expenses income from operations other income expenses  net income tax expense net income net sales for the years ended december  and  we had net sales of million and million  respectively  a decrease of 
net sales by our major ems industry markets for the years ended december  and are as follows in thousands change aerospace and defense medical industrial total net sales net sales to our aerospace and defense and medical customers are down slightly compared to levels 
the defense markets and programs continue to feel the effects of funding and potential budget cuts  while the medical markets were adjusting to new regulations resulting from the new health care act 
the decrease in 
table of contents sales to the industrial market relates to uncertainty in the overall economy 
backlog our day backlog was approximately million on december   compared to million at december  our backlog consists of firm purchase orders and we expect a major portion of the current day backlog to be realized as revenue during the following quarter 
as we end the year we are getting mixed results 
our aerospace and defense backlog is flat  our medical backlog is experiencing increased activity with our medical device customers and our industrial backlog is down due to continued economic pressures 
backlog as of the year ended december change in thousands aerospace and defense medical industrial total backlog our day backlog varies due to order size  manufacturing delays  inventory programs  contract terms and conditions and timing from customer delivery schedules and releases 
these variables cause inconsistencies in comparing the backlog from one period to the next

cash flows for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash on december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to million at the end of during  we generated approximately million of cash from operating activities mainly due to profits and the noncash addback of depreciation  a strong collection year in accounts receivable and a reduction in inventory spending compared to the prior year which resulted in a million reduction in accounts receivable and a million decrease in inventories 
our net cash used in investing activities of million is due primarily to the purchase of property and equipment 
the purchase of the mankato building we were previously leasing accounted for million of these purchases 
net cash used in financing activities of million consisted of a million decrease in the line of credit and million of payments on long term debt  offset by million of additional borrowings
