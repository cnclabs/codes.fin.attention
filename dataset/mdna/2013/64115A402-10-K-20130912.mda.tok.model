implementation process implementation is a process which starts after the delivery of the license to the customer 
netsol signs separate agreements for services  if required by the customers  which is independent of the license agreement 
the implementation process can span from three to six months 
netsol s software is a pre developed solution for the leasing and finance industry 
customers with in house abilities tend to take care of the implementation with their internal resources 
the implementation process includes related software services such as configuration  data migration and any other additional third party interfaces 
after the delivery of the license  customers seek enhancements and additions to improve their business processes 
netsol charges these efforts in man day rate 
if required  the services also involve migration of data from client s older system to the nfs database 
nfs provides mission critical software solutions  and the entire business operations of our clients hinge on successful performance of the system 
hence in the early days after going live  netsol consultants remain at the client site to assist the company in smooth operations 
after this phase  the regular maintenance and support services phase for the implemented software begins 
in addition to the daily rate paid by the customer for each consultant  the customer also pays for all the transportation related expenses  boarding of the consultants  and a living allowance 
netsol s involvement in all of the above steps is priced to bring value to our customers and increase our profitability from our interactions 
pricing and revenue streams the company s nfs revenue streams occur through the following three main areas product licensing  implementation related services  and maintenance and support related services 
license fees can vary generally between  for saas minimal modules to over  for more robust multiple module implementations 
there are various attributes which determine the level of complexity  a few of which are number of contracts  size of the portfolio  business strategy of the customer  number of business users  and branch network of the customer 
the company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non cancelable  non contingent license agreement has been signed  delivery of the software has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
however  revenue from sale of licenses with major customization  modification  and development is recognized on a percent of completion basis 
implementation related services  including configuration  data migration and third party interfaces are recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method 
maintenance and support related services are then provided on a continued basis 
revenue from software services includes fixed price contracts and is recognized in accordance with the percentage of completion method using the output measure of unit of work completed 
the annual maintenance fee  which usually is an agreed upon percentage of overall monetary value of the license  then becomes an ongoing revenue stream realized on yearly basis 
growth prospects for nfs growth prospects for nfs are linked to the maturing of the product portfolio and its growing customer base across different geographic and product markets 
with a next generation solution ready for testing at customer sites  netsol is eyeing key international markets for growth in sales 
its sales strategy now carefully balances expansion into new geographic markets  including north and south america  and further penetration of our already leading position in asia pacific 
growth in north america is expected to come from the huge potential market for replacement of legacy systems 
the next generation version of nfs is aimed at providing a highly flexible solution based on latest technology and advanced architecture for these north american customers looking to replace their legacy systems 
netsol technologies north america ntna is realizing this potential through implementations in the us  mexico and a re energized focus on south america  including brazil 
growth in netsol s traditionally strong base in asia pacific is expected through diversification across market segments  to include new customers in related banking and commercial lending areas

the majority of the growing interest and orders have been concentrated in the apac markets including a ramped up demand for our existing product platform 
additionally  netsol is experiencing an increased demand for nfs in the north american market 
with this increased demand comes the need to maintain our delivery and implementation capability in our delivery centers 
this requires not only aggressive capacity building  improved efficiencies and effectiveness but staying ahead of fast changing technology 
with the progress in next generation development  we must stay ahead in mobile device apps  cloud based solutions and any industry specific transformation that could positively affect our growth prospects 
the existing r solution based clients must be met with the best support and delivery capabilities for continued upward momentum 
as we expect traction in revenues through our next generation solution  netsol will continue offering its current version to businesses looking for a mature and globally tested solution 
future growth will therefore involve increased revenues from both the current version and the next generation of nfs

netsol took the initiative as the first us nasdaq listed company to dual list on the nasdaq dubai exchange in dubai 
although uae markets suffered the impact of recession  this move was primarily to introduce netsol to the potential of the most capitalized middle eastern countries 
by design  netsol has increased its brand recognition in one of the most vibrant and dynamically growing regions 
the asian continent including  australia and new zealand  from the perspective of marketing  are targeted by the asia pacific region from its bangkok  beijing and lahore facilities

the services provided by netsol require proficiency in many fields  such as software engineering  project management  business analysis  technical writing  sales and marketing  communication and presentation skills 
with the cost of programmers and developers on the rise  we have edged up in new talent hiring and retention 
due to the growing demand for our core offerings and it services  retention of technical and management personnel is essential 
we have enhanced the compensation structure for our technical teams and senior management to stay ahead of global and regional competition 
as a result  we have improved it employee turnover from almost in to less than today 
this is a significant milestone towards building capacity and driving revenue growth 
in addition  we are committed to improving key performance indicators such as improving efficiency  increasing productivity and increasing revenue per employee 
to encourage all employees to build on our core values  we reward teamwork and promote individuals who demonstrate these values 
we believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to the high caliber of our employees and our commitment to maintain the values on which our success has been based 
netsol is an equal opportunity employer with over female employees with the biggest concentration in lahore and our us headquarters 
netsol believes it should give back to the community and employees as much as possible 
certain of our subsidiaries are located in regions where basic services are not readily available 
where possible  netsol acts to not only improve the quality of life of its employees but the standard of living in these regions 
examples of such programs are humanitarian relief we are all aware of the devastation that can be wrought by natural disasters 
netsol has historically supported earthquake and flood relief where the need is the greatest 
literacy program launched to educate low paid illiterate employees of the organization 
the main objective of this program is to enable these resources to acquire basic reading  writing and arithmetic skills 
noble cause fund a noble cause fund has been established to meet medical and education expenses of the children of low paid employees 
netsol employees voluntarily contribute a fixed amount every month to the fund and the company matches the employee subscriptions with an equivalent contribution amount 
a portion of this fund is utilized to support social needs of certain institutions and individuals  outside netsol 
day care facility netsol s human resources are its key assets and thus the company takes numerous steps to ensure the provision of basic comforts to its employees 
in pakistan  the provision of outside pre school child care is a rarity 
keeping in view this requirement  a child day care facility has been created in close proximity to the work premises equipped with the necessary essential staff and equipment

the non it personnel include employees in management  employees in sales and marketing  employees in accounting  in customer support  and in general and administration 
none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
competition neither a single company  nor a small number of companies  dominate the it market in the space in which the company competes 
a substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those offered by netsol 
some of these are large industrial firms  including computer manufacturers and computer consulting firms that have greater financial resources than netsol and  in some cases  may have greater capacity to perform services similar to those provided by netsol 
in the nfs business space  the barriers to entry are getting higher 
the products are becoming more cutting edge while richness in functionality is paramount 
older companies have prolonged the life of their legacy products by creating web based front ends  while the core of the systems has not been re engineered 
in the case of nfs  we compete chiefly against leading suppliers of it solutions to the financial industry  including names such as white clarke  fimasys  international decision systems ids  data scan  chp consulting  i infotech  finnone and nucleus software 
in the it based business services areas  we compete with both smaller local firms and many global it services providers  including names such as wipro  infosys  satyam infoway  hcl and tcs tata consulting 
our competition is based primarily in high cost locations in the us  uk and other parts of europe as opposed to netsol with its facility in bangkok and lahore

item a risk factors we have yet to fully remedy the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and accordingly in our disclosure controls and procedures 
this failure to remedy these weaknesses may result in a lack of confidence in our financial reporting and negatively affect our stock price and financial viability 
beginning with our k for the year ending june   our management concluded that our core accounting staff does not have sufficient u 
s gaap experience and training 
this lack of sufficient us gaap expertise in the core accounting staff led to the management s determination that this is a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting and  accordingly  in our disclosure controls and procedures 
since  we have actively sought a us cpa candidate to act as interim or permanent chief financial officer cfo 
on september   we announced the appointment of roger almond  cpa  as cfo of the company 
mr 
almond has the requisite us gaap and sec experience to remedy this weakness 
while we anticipate that mr 
almond s oversight will lead to a removal of this weakness  as he did not oversee the preparation of the financial accounts for the year ending june   and pending his oversight of the accounts for consecutive quarterly periods  we will not be able to immediately remove the material weakness disclosure
