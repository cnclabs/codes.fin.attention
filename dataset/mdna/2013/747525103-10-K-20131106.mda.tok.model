item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview recent developments revenues for fiscal were billion  with net income attributable to qualcomm of billion  which primarily resulted from the following key items we shipped approximately million mobile station modem msm integrated circuits for cdma and ofdma based wireless devices  an increase of  compared to approximately million msm integrated circuits in fiscal total reported device sales were approximately billion  an increase of approximately  compared to approximately billion in fiscal against this backdrop  the following recent developments occurred during fiscal with respect to key elements of our business or our industry worldwide cellular connections grew by approximately to reach approximately billion 
worldwide g connections all cdma based grew by approximately to approximately billion  which was approximately of total cellular subscriptions  including approximately billion cdma x xev do subscriptions and approximately billion wcdma hspa td scdma subscriptions 
total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in us dollars as reported to us by our licensees of all licensed cdma based  ofdma based and cdma ofdma multimode subscriber devices including handsets  modules  modem cards and other subscriber devices by our licensees during a particular period collectively  g g devices 
not all licensees report sales the same way eg  some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions  including transportation  insurance  packing costs and other items  while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports  and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time 
total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period 
according to gsma intelligence estimates as of november   for the quarter ended september  estimates excluded wireless local loop 
our business and operating segments we design  manufacture  have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies 
we derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products  fixed license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property  and fees for messaging and other services and related hardware sales  software development and licensing  and related services and software hosting services 
costs and expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services revenues and research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we conduct business primarily through four reportable segments qct  qtl  qwi and qsi 
our reportable segments are operated by qualcomm incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries 
at the beginning of fiscal  we completed a corporate reorganization in which certain assets of qualcomm incorporated  as well as the stock of certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries  were contributed to its wholly owned subsidiary qualcomm technologies  inc qti 
qtl continues to be operated by qualcomm incorporated  which continues to own the vast majority of our patent portfolio 
substantially all of our products and services businesses  including qct  and substantially all of our engineering  research and development functions  are operated by qti and its subsidiaries 
neither qti nor any of its subsidiaries has any right  power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by qualcomm incorporated 
qct qualcomm cdma technologies is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on cdma  ofdma and other technologies for use in voice and data communications  networking  application processing  multimedia and global positioning system products 
qct s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices  particularly mobile phones  tablets  laptops  data modules  handheld wireless computers and gaming devices  access points and routers  data cards and infrastructure equipment  and in wired devices  particularly broadband gateway equipment  desktop computers  televisions  set top boxes and blu ray players 
the msm integrated circuits  which include the mobile data modem  qualcomm single chip and qualcomm snapdragon processor devices  perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications  as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions 
in addition  our snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities 
qct s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits 
qct revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qct utilizes a fabless production business model  which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made 
integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes 
we rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly  and most of the testing  of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs 
our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits 
we employ both turnkey and two stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits 
turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits 
under the two stage manufacturing model  we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third party suppliers for probe  assembly and test services 
qtl qualcomm technology licensing grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which  among other rights  includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products  including  without limitation  products implementing cdma  wcdma  cdma tdd including td scdma  gsm gprs edge and or ofdma standards and their derivatives 
qtl licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property 
license fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments 
royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale ie  licensee s selling price of complete licensed products  net of certain permissible deductions eg  certain shipping costs  packing costs  vat  eg qtl recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met 
licensees  however  do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter 
qtl revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees sales of cdma and wcdma based products  such as feature phones and smartphones 
qwi qualcomm wireless internet  which includes our omnitracs  qis  qgov and qrs divisions  generates revenues primarily through sales of products  services including software development and software aimed at the support and delivery of wireless applications 
omnitracs sells integrated wireless systems and services to transportation and logistics companies to manage their assets and workforce 
on august   we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to sell the north and latin american operations of omnitracs to a us based private equity firm for million in cash  subject to the terms and conditions of the definitive agreement 
the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals  and is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to record the gain on sale  net of income taxes  as a discontinued operation upon close 
however  the revenues and operating results were not presented as a discontinued operation in any fiscal period because they were immaterial 
qis qualcomm internet services provides content enablement services for the wireless industry  including its brew  plaza and other products and services 
qis also provides qchat push to talk and other software products and services for wireless operators 
qgov qualcomm government technologies provides development and other services and related products involving wireless communications technologies to government agencies and their contractors 
qrs qualcomm retail solutions builds and manages software applications that enable certain mobile location awareness and commerce services 
qwi revenues comprised  and of total consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
qsi qualcomm strategic initiatives makes strategic investments that we believe may open new or expand opportunities for our technologies  support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology 
many of these strategic investments are in early stage companies 
qsi also holds wireless spectrum 
as part of our strategic investment activities  we intend to pursue various exit strategies from each of our qsi investments at some point in the future 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we deconsolidated subsidiaries that were established to operate a wireless network in india using broadband wireless access spectrum the bwa subsidiaries due to events that resulted in a change in control of these subsidiaries 
the former bwa subsidiaries were merged into one entity on august   and on october   all of our interest in the remaining former subsidiary was sold 
nonreportable segments are comprised of our qmt qualcomm mems technologies division and other display  wireless technology and service initiatives that include  but are not limited to low power consumption  high optical performance flat display modules  medical device connectivity and related data management  augmented reality  and device to device communication 
qmt continues to develop an interferometric modulator imod display technology based on micro electro mechanical systems mems structure combined with thin film optics 
discontinued operations on march   the flo tv business and network were shut down 
on december   we completed the sale of substantially all of our mhz spectrum for billion  and as a result  we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of billion during fiscal the results of the discontinued flo tv operations were as follows in millions year ended september  september  revenues income loss from discontinued operations income tax expense benefit discontinued operations  net of income taxes looking forward the deployment of g networks has enabled increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks  thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets  g connected computing devices and other consumer electronics 
according to the global mobile suppliers association gsa  as of october  to complement their existing g networks  more than wireless operators have deployed and more than wireless operators are planning to deploy ofdma based technology  often called g  in new wireless spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services 
as a result  we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for g and g g multimode products and services around the world 
as we look forward to the next several months  the following items are likely to have an impact on our business the worldwide transition from g to g and g g networks is expected to continue  including the further expansion of g in emerging regions  such as china 
we expect that the growth of low tier smartphone products will contribute to such expansion 
we expect consumer demand for advanced g and g g multimode devices  including smartphones and data centric devices  to continue at a strong pace 
we expect that cdma based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers 
additionally  varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of cdma based device shipments in emerging regions  as compared to developed regions  are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of cdma based devices 
we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements to g  g g and g lte an ofdma based standard technologies  audio and video codecs  wireless baseband chips  our converged computing communications snapdragon chips  multimedia products  software and services 
we are also investing across a broad spectrum of opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments  such as our imod and other display technologies  g lte and wi fi products designed for implementation of small cells and the x data challenge  wireless charging  proximity based communications  very high speed connectivity  mobile location awareness and commerce  mobile health  wearable technology  gaming  and products for the connected home  the digital th sense and the internet of everything 
in addition to the foregoing business and market based matters  we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry 
however  we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new  highly cost effective competitors to their products 
we expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world 
further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the risk factors included in this annual report 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  valuation of intangible assets and investments  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable  actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
we believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property 
the timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors  including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations 
we license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio  which includes certain patent rights essential to and or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products 
licensing revenues include license fees payable in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on licensees sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property 
license fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee  typically to years 
from time to time  licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons  and when this occurs  the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected 
valuation of intangible assets and investments 
our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
we also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions 
at september   our goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were billion and billion  respectively 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
for intangible assets purchased in a business combination  the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values 
for intangible assets acquired in a non monetary exchange  the estimated fair values of the assets transferred or the estimated fair values of the assets received  if more clearly evident are used to establish their recorded values  unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits  in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred 
valuation techniques consistent with the market approach  income approach and or cost approach are used to measure fair value 
an estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment 
for example  the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows  total addressable market  pricing and share forecasts  competition  technology obsolescence  future tax rates and discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models 
new information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired 
long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses  market conditions and other factors 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use  including estimates of future cash flows  volumes  market penetration and discount rates  are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
during fiscal and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in impairment charges resulting from revisions to our estimates of expected cash flows for certain long lived assets of our qmt division as we continue to pursue our licensing model 
we hold investments in marketable securities  including us treasury and government related securities  corporate bonds and notes  mortgage and asset backed securities  auction rate securities  common and preferred stock and equity and debt funds 
the fair value of these investments totaled billion at september   with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders equity as other comprehensive income or loss 
we record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary 
the determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
in addition  the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby requiring impairment charges 
when assessing these investments for an other than temporary decline in value  we consider such factors as  among other things  how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost  how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost  the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class  negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others  the performance and pricing of the investee s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general  and analyst recommendations  as applicable 
we also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties 
if we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary  we record an impairment loss  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities 
income taxes 
our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
while we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns  we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
we are participating in the irs compliance assurance process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the irs on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return 
a benefit of participation in this program is that post filing adjustments by the irs are less likely to occur 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
at september   net deferred tax assets were billion  which included a valuation allowance of million 
if we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
we can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions 
at september   we had unused federal  state and foreign net operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities  we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal therefore  we have provided a million valuation allowance for these net operating losses 
significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions 
adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made 
our qct segment s non united states headquarters is located in singapore 
we obtained tax incentives in singapore  including a tax exemption for the first five years  provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria  and as a result of expiration of these incentives  our singapore tax rate will increase in fiscal and again in fiscal we consider the operating earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the united states based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs 
we have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately billion related to the united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the united states 
should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings  we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the united states 
litigation 
we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves 
however  the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated 
we record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations

qct gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal as a result of the net effects of lower average selling prices  unfavorable product mix and higher product support costs  partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs 
the higher product support costs in fiscal primarily related to increased expenses incurred to facilitate additional supply of nanometer integrated circuits 
qct inventories increased by in fiscal from million to billion primarily due to certain higher value msm products and an increase in work in process and finished goods related to growth of the business 
qtl segment 
the increases in qtl revenues in fiscal and of billion and million  respectively  were primarily due to increases in sales of cdma based devices by licensees 
the net increase in qtl revenues in fiscal also included the effect of million in revenues recorded in fiscal in connection with settlement agreements entered into with two licensees 
the decrease in qtl ebt as a percentage of revenues during fiscal was attributable to an increase of in revenues relative to an increase of in costs and expenses primarily due to increased allocation of patent expenses in connection with the corporate reorganization and increased research and development expenses 
qwi segment 
the decrease in qwi revenues in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in qis revenues

qwi costs and expenses in fiscal and included million and million respectively  of goodwill impairment charges related to our qrs division 
the million decrease in qwi ebt during fiscal  excluding the impairment charges  was primarily attributable to a million increase in qrs operating loss before the impairment charges 
the million increase in qwi ebt in fiscal  excluding the impairment charges  was primarily attributable to a million decrease in qrs operating loss before the impairment charges and a million decrease in qis operating loss 
qsi segment 
qsi costs and expenses for fiscal included million related to a payment made to the indian government concurrent with the issuance of the bwa spectrum license 
the increases in qsi ebt in fiscal and of million and million  respectively  excluding this expense  were primarily due to increases of million and million  respectively  in net realized gains on investments and decreases of million and million  respectively  in interest expense as a result of capitalizing interest starting in the third quarter of fiscal related to the bwa subsidiaries  which were deconsolidated in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were billion at september   an increase of billion from september  this increase included billion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september  consisted of billion held by united states based subsidiaries and billion held by foreign subsidiaries 
of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september   billion is indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated 
due to tax considerations  we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically 
total cash provided by operating activities increased to billion during fiscal  compared to billion during fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased and retired  shares of common stock for billion  before commissions 
at september   approximately billion remained available for repurchase under a new stock repurchase program announced in september  and we currently expect to complete a minimum of billion of stock repurchases during fiscal the stock repurchase program has no expiration date 
we continue to evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders  subject to our periodic determinations that repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders 
we paid dividends totaling billion and billion  or and per common share  during fiscal and  respectively 
on march   we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from to per share of common stock 
on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share of common stock  payable on december  to stockholders of record as of december  we intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders  subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders 
accounts receivable increased during fiscal days sales outstanding  on a consolidated basis  were days at september  compared to days at september  the increase in accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to growth of the business and the effects of timing of shipments and customer payments for receivables related to integrated circuits 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans 
our research and development expenditures were billion and billion in fiscal and  respectively  and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies  applications and services for voice and data communications  primarily in the wireless industry 
cash outflows for capital expenditures were billion and billion in fiscal and  respectively  including approximately million in fiscal related to the construction of a new manufacturing facility in taiwan for our qmt division 
we expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business  including research and development activities 
future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted 
our purchase obligations for fiscal  some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures  totaled billion at september  on august   we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to sell the north and latin american operations of our omnitracs division for million  subject to closing conditions  including receipt of regulatory approvals 
we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of fiscal we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions  the amounts of which could vary significantly  to open new opportunities for our technologies  obtain development resources  grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business

amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments 
capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at september  these commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions 
commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements  actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all 
certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet  such as unearned revenues  are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future 
other long term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions 
our consolidated balance sheet at september  included a million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions  all of which may result in cash payment 
the future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed and floating rate securities  consisting of cash equivalents  marketable debt securities  debt funds and derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  that are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio 
if interest rates in the general economy were to rise  our holdings could lose value 
historically  we presented a table that disclosed certain information including principal or notional amounts  interest rates and maturities regarding our interest bearing instruments 
however  given the increased size and diversity in our investment portfolio  we believe that providing a sensitivity analysis provides more meaningful disclosure regarding the impact to our holdings of potential changes in interest rates 
as a result  in lieu of the tabular presentation  we are providing a sensitivity analysis that shows the effect of an assumed basis point adverse movement in interest rates across the entire yield curve 
at september   a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points on our holdings would have resulted in decreases of million and million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading including derivative instruments and our remaining holdings  respectively 
at september   the same hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in decreases of million and million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading including derivative instruments and our remaining holdings  respectively 
equity price risk 
we hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk 
we have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size  style  industry and geography  and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments 
a decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at september  would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of million 
at september   gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were million 
although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary  there is a risk that we may incur other than temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period 
foreign exchange risk 
we manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments  including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties 
we utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes 
counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major banking institutions 
in the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments  we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us  which could have a negative impact on our results 
see notes to consolidated financial statements  note the company and its significant accounting policies for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies 
at september   we had a net asset of million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of cdma based devices 
if our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in our hedged foreign currency  we would incur a loss of million 
at september   we had a net liability of million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on intercompany payments of operating expenditures relating to a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
if our forecasted operating expenditures were to decline by and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by in each of our hedged foreign currencies  we would not incur a loss 
at september   we had a net liability of million related to foreign currency forwards  futures  options and swaps that were not designated as hedging instruments related to our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading 
if the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading  we would incur a loss of million 
financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings 
as a global company  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
we may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions 
as a result  we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows  as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments 
while we may hedge certain transactions with non united states customers  declines in currency values in certain regions may  if not reversed  adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies 
our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks
