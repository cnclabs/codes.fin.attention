overview mcewen mining inc was organized under the laws of the state of colorado on july  we are a mining and minerals exploration company focused on precious metals in argentina  mexico and the united states 
on january   we changed our name from us gold corporation to mcewen mining inc after the completion of the acquisition  by way of a statutory plan of arrangement pursuant to the laws of the province of alberta  canada  of minera andes inc minera andes 
our principal assets consists of our interest in the san jos mine in santa cruz  argentina  the el gallo complex in sinaloa  mexico  the gold bar project in nevada  united states  the los azules project in san juan  argentina  and a large portfolio of exploration properties in argentina  nevada and mexico

all of our financial information is reported in united states us dollars  unless otherwise noted 
development and exploration activities el gallo complex  mexico in september  we had our first gold pour at el gallo phase upon completion of the phase construction  which had a total cost of million 
total production for was  oz of gold and  oz of silver during the start up period 
el gallo phase achieved commercial production on january  in  production for phase is forecasted to be approximately  oz of gold 

table of contents in september  the feasibility study for phase was completed and it reported an estimate of million tonnes of mineralized material including only the el gallo and palmarito deposits with a weighted average grade of gpt of gold and gpt of silver 
the report projected an average annual production rate of million oz of silver and  oz of gold during each of the first six years at a cash operating cost of per silver oz net of gold by product and including royalties 
the feasibility study also estimated initial capital expenditures to be million  including a contingency 
in preparation for phase operations  we completed three production water wells during and the results from the pumping tests indicate there is sufficient water to meet our needs 
we also received approval from mexico federal electricity commission for our designs to connect phase to the national electrical grid 
environmental permits to construct the power line were submitted at the end of environmental permits for construction and operations are progressing and are expected to be submitted to mexico environmental and natural resources ministry during the first quarter of we also expect to begin procurement in the first quarter of of long lead time equipment such as the ball mill  filter presses for dry stack tailings  merrill crowe plant  leach tanks and electrical substation 
during  approximately  ft 
 m of drilling was completed at the el gallo complex 
we expect to drill approximately  ft 
 m during with a total exploration budget of approximately million 
gold bar project  nevada during  we continued to advance the gold bar project through the permitting process 
baseline studies were completed in support of the us bureau of land management blm and state of nevada permitting required for mine development and construction 
we expect to submit our plan of operations permit application during the second half of as the official permitting process has begun  we are unable to perform any drilling activities at gold bar 
our budget for gold bar  primarily for permitting activities  is million 
los azules copper project  argentina in august  the company issued a ni compliant technical report  which estimated billion tonnes of mineralized material with a weighted average grade of percent copper 
in february we announced an updated estimate  which estimated billion tonnes of mineralized material with a weighted average grade of percent copper 
the february estimate incorporated the results of the drilling completed from october through december during the prior drill season in the first half of  drilling at the project was slow due to difficult ground conditions and equipment problems 
a total of  ft 
 m was drilled during the field season in eight holes  which ran from early january to late april and fell short of the  ft 
 m target originally planned 
although significant intercepts of copper mineralization were encountered  most of the drill holes started were unable to reach their target depth due to difficult ground conditions 
we began the drill season in october with a total of five core drills and one rotary drill which are more powerful than the ones used in the prior season 
a total of  ft 
 m was drilled during the fourth quarter of the current drilling season is expected to end in april we plan to drill a total of  ft 
 m over the current drilling season 
the budget for the entire drilling season is estimated to be million 
in november  mcewen mining and tnr gold corp 
agreed that all claims and counterclaims would be discontinued or resolved 
the material terms of the settlement included 
table of contents that i tnr would receive  common shares of mcewen mining  ii tnr would transfer the escorpio iv claim to mcewen mining  and iii the xstrata solitario agreement will be amended so tnr will retain a back in right for up to of the equity in the solitario properties 
the back in right is only exercisable after the completion of a feasibility study 
to exercise  tnr must pay two times the expenses attributable to the back in percentage ie paying all of the costs attributable to the solitario properties 
upon backing in  tnr may elect to continue to participate in the project or be diluted down to a nsr on solitario properties 
santa cruz exploration  argentina during  a total of  ft 
 m of percussion drilling was completed on our celestina project and a total of  ft 
 m of blast holes and diamond drilling was completed on our cerro mojon project 
exploration work ceased towards the end of may with the onset of argentinean winter 
in september  we received the drill permits for the telken project  one of our owned claim package adjacent to the san jos mine 
during the fourth quarter of  we commenced drilling at telken with a reverse circulation drill rig for a total of  ft 
 m 
the plan is to drill approximately  ft 
 m for the drilling season 
we are continuing with our review of our owned properties in the province of santa cruz  argentina with extensive sampling and mapping taking place  along with selective drilling of prospective targets 
we have budgeted million towards exploration in santa cruz for corporate development activities rights offering during the fourth quarter of  we launched a transferrable rights offering  in which all existing holders of common stock and holders of exchangeable shares had the opportunity to participate on an equal and proportional basis in purchasing additional common stock or exchangeable shares at a price of or c per share  which represented a discount to the closing share price prior to the announcement 
shareholders received one right for each share of common stock or exchangeable share and rights were needed to purchase an additional share of the same class 
mr 
mcewen purchased million shares of common stock and million exchangable shares for a total cost of million 
upon completion of the rights offering  we issued an additional million shares of common stock and million exchangeable shares for proceeds of approximately million  net of million in expenses 
business acquisition on january   we completed the acquisition of minera andes through a court approved plan of arrangement under alberta  canada law the arrangement  under which minera andes  a canadian company  became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of mcewen mining 
our management and board of directors believes that the combination with minera andes is in the best interests of our company and our shareholders because the combined company is expected to have a stronger combined cash position and balance sheet  sources of revenue  active mining operations  enhanced trading liquidity  a significant growth profile  an expanded exploration program and additional technical expertise 
on the closing date of the arrangement  holders of minera andes common stock received a number of exchangeable shares of mcewen mining minera andes acquisition corp 
exchangeable shares  an indirect wholly owned canadian subsidiary of mcewen mining  equal to the number of minera andes shares  multiplied by the exchange ratio of 
in the aggregate  former minera andes 
table of contents shareholders received  exchangeable shares 
our common stock began trading on the nyse and tsx under the symbol mux and the exchangeable shares began trading on the tsx under the symbol maq on january  in june  robert r 
mcewen  our chairman  president  chief executive officer and largest shareholder and then also the chairman  president  chief executive officer and largest shareholder of minera andes  proposed the arrangement 
in connection with the arrangement  mr 
mcewen received approximately million exchangeable shares 
mr 
mcewen owns approximately of the shares of the company 
as a result of the arrangement and on the date of closing  the combined company was held approximately by then existing mcewen mining shareholders and by former minera andes shareholders 
on a diluted basis  the combined company was held approximately by then existing mcewen mining shareholders and by former minera andes shareholders 
the exchangeable shares are exchangeable for our common stock on a one for one basis 
option holders of minera andes received replacement options entitling them to receive  upon exercise  shares of our common stock  reflecting the exchange ratio of with the appropriate adjustment of the exercise price per share 
the option life and vesting period of the replacement options has not changed from the option life granted under the minera andes option plan 
the estimated fair value of the vested portion of the replacement options of million have been included as part of the purchase price consideration at their fair values based on the black scholes pricing model as illustrated below 
the principal assumptions used in applying the black scholes option pricing model were as follows january  risk free interest rate to dividend yield n a volatility factor of the expected market price of common stock to weighted average expected life of option years the acquisition has been accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with asc topic  business combinations  with mcewen mining being identified as the acquirer 
the measurement of the purchase consideration was based on the market price of our common stock on january   which was per share 
the total purchase price  including the fair value of the options  amounted to million 
the total transaction costs incurred through december  by us was million  of which million was reported in the year ended december  in general and administrative expenses  and million for the year ended december  in acquisition costs in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 

table of contents the allocation of the purchase price  based on the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed on january   is summarized in the following table in thousands 
fair value purchase price exchangeable shares of mcewen mining minera andes acquisition corp 
stock options to be exchanged for options of mcewen mining inc net assets acquired cash and cash equivalents short term investments other current assets inventories mineral property interests investment in minera santa cruz sa equipment accounts payable deferred income tax liability for the purposes of our financial statements  the purchase consideration has been allocated to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on an independent valuation report and management best estimates and taking into account all available information at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared 
mineral property interests acquired relate primarily to the los azules copper project while the investment in minera santa cruz sa reflects the ownership of the san jos mine 
the deferred income tax liability arises due to the excess of the fair market values reflected herein compared to the underlying tax values of those assets 
dividend receivable as a result of the acquisition of minera andes  we also acquired a dividend receivable of million due from msc which was paid on february  during the remainder of  we received an additional million in dividends for a total of million in dividends from msc during liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  comprised of current assets of million and current liabilities of million 
this represents an increase of approximately million from the working capital of million at fiscal year end december  with the acquisition of minera andes on january   our working capital in increased by approximately million  including the dividend receivable from msc of million 
we expect to receive further dividends from msc during  although the timing and amount of those dividends will depend upon silver and gold prices  production levels  operating costs  capital expenditures  argentine central bank and government restrictions  and a variety of other factors beyond our control 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and from million in  primarily due to an increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees  partially offset by dividends received from msc of million and cash received from gold and silver sales from mexico of million 
cash paid to suppliers and employees 
table of contents increased to million for the period from million and million during the and periods respectively  as a result of the acquisition of minera andes and the increased development and construction expenditures of el gallo phase cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to cash received from the acquisition of minera andes of million as well as proceeds from the sale of gold and silver bullion of million 
this compares to cash used in investing activities of million in the comparable period of  primarily due to additional purchases of gold and silver bullion of million  acquisition of mineral property interests in nevada and mexico of million  additional purchases of property and equipment of million mostly in mexico  and investment in short term canadian treasury bills of million  partially offset by proceeds from the sale of gold and silver bullion and marketable securities aggregating million 
this compares to cash provided by investing activities in of million  primarily due to the redemption of our short term us and canadian treasury bills of million  partially offset by additional purchases of gold bullion of million  investment in marketable equity securities of million  acquisition of mining concessions in mexico of million and property and equipment in mexico of million 
cash provided by financing activities for was million from the rights offering of million shares of common stock and million shares of exchangeable shares and the exercise of stock options  compared to million from the public offering of million shares and the exercise of stock options in the comparable period of cash provided by financing activities in was million 
overall  our cash increased by million in  providing us needed capital 
we believe our working capital at december  is sufficient to fund ongoing exploration and corporate activities over the next months 
our sources of working capital at december  include cash on hand  other current assets  revenue from phase of el gallo and any distributions from the san jos mine 
however  in order to fund the development of el gallo phase  pending receipt of regulatory approvals  we will need to raise additional capital given the capital cost is estimated at approximately million which significantly exceeds our available working capital 
tabular disclosure of contractual obligations schedule of contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments as of december  to make future payments under certain contracts  aggregated by category of contractual obligation  for specified time periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations accounts payable accrued liabilitites asset retirement obligations total 
table of contents results of operations msc overview the following discussion relates only to msc and is disclosed on a basis of which we indirectly own 
we account for our investment in msc using the equity method 
furthermore  this discussion is based on the results for the full year of whereas we have only recorded income from our equity investment for the period from january  to december  msc  the entity which owns and operates the san jos mine  is responsible for and has supplied to us all reported results and operational updates from the san jos mine 
for the year ended december   msc reported net income of million 
the amortization of the fair value increments arising from the purchase price allocation decreased the reported net income from msc for the year ended december  by million 
during the year ended december   production was  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver  compared to production of  ounces of gold and  ounces of silver in this represents an increase of for gold production and for silver production 
the following table sets out production totals  sales totals  total cash costs  and all in sustaining cash costs on a co product basis for the san jos mine for and total cash costs and all in sustaining cash costs are considered to be non gaap measures see non gaap measures  page

the decrease in sales revenue was primarily due to a reduction in the realized price of silver  partially offset by an increase in both the realized price and number of ounces of gold sold 

table of contents the average weighted gross sale price for gold sold in was  per ounce  an increase of compared to the average price of  per ounce received in the average weighted gross sale price for silver sold in was per ounce  a decrease of compared to the average price of per ounce received in in comparison  the average london pm fix price for gold was  per ounce for compared to  for  a increase 
the average london pm fix price for silver was per ounce for compared to per ounce for  an decrease 
the average gross sale price for gold sold in the fourth quarter of was  per ounce  a decrease of compared to  per ounce received in the same period in the average weighted gross sale price for silver sold in the fourth quarter of was per ounce  a decrease of compared to per ounce received in the same period in total cash costs and all in sustaining cash costs the terms total cash costs  total cash cost per ounce  all in sustaining cash costs and all in sustaining cash cost per ounce used in this section are for the reporting of the msc operations only and are considered to be non gaap measures see non gaap measures  page 
total cash costs consists of geology  mining  processing  general and administrative costs  royalty costs  refining and treatment charges for both dor and concentrate products  sales costs and export taxes 
all in sustaining cash costs consists of total cash costs as noted above  plus corporate general and administrative costs  environmental rehabilitation costs  mine site exploration and development costs  and sustaining capital expenditures 
depreciation is excluded from both total cash costs and all in sustaining cash costs 
the world gold council believes that the all in sustaining cash costs measure better represents the total costs associated with producing gold 
we have adopted this reporting methodology based on a draft standard from the world gold council and there is no assurance that these measures are necessarily comparable to our industry peers 
total cash costs for the san jos mine were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in the increase in costs in was due to inflationary pressures on labor costs  materials and supplies within argentina 
all in sustaining cash costs were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period in on a per ounce co product basis  the average total cash cost was per ounce of gold and per ounce of silver for the year ended december   as compared to per ounce of gold and per ounce of silver for the same period in on a per ounce co product basis  the average all in sustaining cash cost was  per ounce of gold and per ounce of silver for the year ended december   as compared to per ounce of gold and per ounce of silver for the same period in co product average total cash costs and all in sustaining cash costs are calculated by dividing the respective proportionate share of the total cash costs and all in sustaining cash costs for each metal for the period by the ounces of each respective metal sold 
accordingly  approximately of the value of the sales was derived from gold and was derived from silver 
the increase in per ounce co product costs for both gold and silver during the year ended december  compared to the prior year is primarily related to higher labor costs  higher materials and supplies costs  inflationary pressures within argentina  and a higher percentage of sales coming from concentrate sales versus dor 
dor production was significantly reduced in the first half of while modifications were made to the process plant and production of concentrate was temporarily increased during this time 
concentrate sales carry higher refining  treatment and export taxes on a per ounce basis than dor 

table of contents investment in msc the following table shows the reconciliation of msc net income  as reported under us gaap  compared to the equity pickup that is reported on our financial statements 
since the acquisition of minera andes closed on january   we began recording our share of msc equity earnings from january  based on the purchase price allocation  the investment in msc was originally allocated an estimated fair value of million during the first half of and million during the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the purchase price allocation was finalized and the estimated fair value of the investment in msc was increased to million 
the adjustment affected the composition of the fair value allocation to msc assets  resulting in a reduction in the amortization reported for the first two quarters of and an increase for the third quarter of below is a reconciliation of the adjustment for the first three quarters of for three months ended march  for three months ended june  for the three months ended september  in thousands amortization of fair value increments  as reported adjustment amortization of fair value increments  as adjusted net loss  as reported adjustment net loss  as adjusted the change in our investment in msc for the year ended december  is summarized as follows as at december  in thousands investment in msc  beginning of period fair value of investment in msc from acquisition of minera andes income from equity investment amortization of fair value increments dividend distribution investment in msc  end of period

these balances include the increase in fair value and amortization of the fair value increments arising from the purchase price allocation 
during  the company received dividends from msc totaling million  consisting of million dividend receivable acquired from minera andes and million declared and received in exploration in  a total of  feet  meters of diamond drilling was completed  of which  feet  meters was for near mine   feet  meters was for infill and  feet  meters was for prospecting 
the total amount of exploration spending for was million 
total footage drilled was approximately below budget  whereas total exploration expenditures were approximately over budget mainly due to higher actual contract drilling costs and deeper drilling for infill 
a new high grade gold silver vein system  the emilia vein  was discovered within the known san jos mine area 
the discovery of this new vein system is encouraging and illustrates the prospective nature of the san jos mine and the surrounding package 
at the end of the crushing circuit was modified  at a cost of approximately million  which is expected to lead to a permanent increase in mill throughput 
we expect production  on a basis  to be approximately million ounces of silver and  ounces of gold  which reflects the increase in mill capacity 
it is noteworthy that there were no labor related work stoppages at the mine during exploration during successfully replaced production that occurred during the year with new reserves  and exploration during are expected to focus on areas to the southeast of the mine area 
results of consolidated operations year ended december  compared to as a result of the completion of the acquisition of minera andes on january   our financial results for includes the operations of minera andes beginning on january  general 
for the year ended december   we recorded a net loss of million or per share  compared to a net loss of million or per share for the same period in significantly higher costs and expenses in were partially offset by recovery of income taxes 
revenue 
gold and silver sales in came from our phase operation in mexico for a total of million 
there were no sales in since production only began in september 
table of contents income on investment in msc  net of amortization in  was million 
as previously discussed  we obtained our interest in msc with the acquisition of minera andes in january costs and expenses 
our costs and expenses were significantly higher in than prior years  primarily due to the acquisition of minera andes  construction at phase of el gallo and asset impairments 
total costs and expenses in totaled million  compared to million in and million in we experienced significant increases in of mine operating costs  construction costs and general and administrative 
we also wrote off certain assets that we determined were impaired during the year in the amount of million 
production costs applicable to sales at el gallo were million in production costs consist of royalty expense  third party refining costs  direct mining costs which include contract mining services  personnel costs  certain general and administrative costs  energy costs  operating materials and supplies  repairs and maintenance costs and transport fees 
production cost applicable to sales is based on the weighted average cost of ounces sold during the year 
there was no similar cost in since production only began in september mine operating costs were million in the majority of these costs  which were incurred prior to achieving commercial production for accounting purposes in september  were for contract mining services in order to mine and transport waste and mineralized material at the el gallo complex 
there were no similar costs in the comparable period in mine construction costs were million in as compared to million in these costs were incurred at our el gallo complex and they included the construction of the crusher  adr process plant  leach pad  and management costs to oversee the construction at phase as well as preliminary development costs for phase as noted in our critical accounting polices  these costs were expensed rather than capitalized as we have not demonstrated proven and probable reserves at our el gallo complex 
exploration costs increased in by million to million from million in  reflecting a decrease in exploration activities in mexico and nevada to focus more on phase production of the el gallo complex in mexico  and more than offset by the addition of exploration activities on the properties acquired in argentina in during we spent approximately million in exploration expenditures in mexico  which included approximately  ft 
 m of drilling activities  as compared to million and approximately  ft 
 m drilled in during we spent approximately million in exploration expenditures in nevada  which included approximately  ft 
 m of drilling activities  as compared to million and approximately  ft 
 m drilled in from january  to december   we spent approximately million in exploration expenditures in argentina  of which million was spent on the los azules copper project  which included approximately  ft 
 m of drilling activities and the remainder on various exploration properties in santa cruz province  which included  ft 
 m of drilling activities 
property holding costs increased in by million to million as compared to million in the increase was partly due to an accrual of a million non refundable obligation for the long term trust fund required by the blm for the closure of the tonkin mine in nevada  an additional accrual of million related to the asset tax owed to the argentinean government and the addition of the properties acquired in argentina in general and administrative costs increased in by million to million as compared to million in the majority of the increase was a result of the acquisition of minera andes 
the increase was due to an increase in salaries of million  increase in legal fees of million  increase in travel expenses of million  increase in rent of million  increase in accounting and tax of million  increase in stock based compensation expense of million  increase in investor 
table of contents relations activities of million  increase in bank charges of million  increase in consultants of million  increase in insurance cost of million  and the remainder from increases in various miscellaneous expenses 
acquisition costs decreased in by million to million as compared to million in the majority of the costs related to the acquisition of minera andes were incurred in gain on sale of assets was million in during  we disposed of certain inactive milling equipment  mobile homes and vehicles from our tonkin property in nevada and drill rigs and related accessories in argentina for net proceeds of million  which resulted in a net gain of million 
asset impairments were million during as compared to nil in the majority of the impairment arose from our mineral property interests in nevada 
during  we performed a strategic review of our property holdings in nevada and as a result  allowed all the claims from three of the properties to lapse 
these mineral property interests in question were acquired in and had a carrying value of million which was written off entirely 
we also entered into an exploration earn in and joint venture option agreement option agreement with a third party on another nevada property which was acquired in and had a carrying value of million 
we determined that the implied value of the option agreement was million and as a result recorded an impairment of million 
we also wrote off million of mineral property interests in mexico 
in total  million of the million asset impairments recorded in came from the write down of our mineral property interests 
other income expenses 
litigation settlement relates to the  shares required to be issued as part of the settlement of the lawsuit with tnr gold corp  as previously discussed 
this amount represented the fair value of the obligation to deliver the shares as at december  gain on sale of gold and silver bullion was million in as compared to million in during  we sold  ounces of gold bullion and  ounces of silver bullion purchased as investments 
during  we sold  ounces of gold bullion and  ounces of silver bullion purchased as investments 
unrealized loss on silver bullion was million in as compared to million in the unrealized loss resulted from the write down of the value of silver bullion to fair market value at each respective reporting period 
the higher loss in represented a higher balance in silver bullion investment 
other than temporary impairment on marketable equity securities was million in during the second quarter of  we deemed most of our available for sale securities to be impaired due to an other than temporary decline in the value of those securities 
recovery of income taxes 
recovery of income taxes was million in as compared to million in the amount includes million from the revaluation of the deferred income tax liability balance denoted in argentine pesos to us dollars  and the reversal of the deferred income tax liabilities related to the write down of the mineral property interests of million 
other comprehensive loss

costs and expenses 
during  we incurred million on the construction and development of the el gallo complex in connection with phase development of the project 
these activities included mobilization and demobilization of mining equipment  road construction and management costs to oversee the construction 
as noted in our critical accounting policies  these costs are expensed until proven and probable reserves are established 
exploration costs increased by million  from million in to million in  reflecting an increase in exploration activities at the gold bar and limo projects in nevada  and at the el gallo complex in mexico  as well as initiating the richardson project in alaska 
exploration spending in mexico increased by million  from million in to million in  which reflected  a total of  ft 
 m of drilling activity in mexico as compared to  ft 
 m of drilling in the same period in engineering and technical work for the el gallo project was million and included in exploration costs 
during  exploration spending in nevada and alaska increased by million  from million to million 
during the period  a total of  ft 
 m was drilled in nevada and alaska as compared to  ft 
 m drilled in the same period in there was no drilling in alaska in since we signed the agreement in july total pre feasibility costs incurred for the gold bar project for was million as compared to million for the same period in property holding costs for decreased by million  from million in to million in  mainly due to a receivable of million we recorded from the state of nevada for a refund of claim fees paid to the state 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  from million in to million in the increase was due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of million  an increase in salaries and wages of million due to increased staff  an increase in marketing activities of million  an increase in rent and office expenses of million as a result of relocating our head office  and an increase in accounting and tax related costs of million in mexico 
acquisition costs in were million  which was related to the costs related to the business combination with minera andes 
no such costs were incurred in total stock based compensation expense increased by million  from million in to million in  reflecting increased expenses associated with stock option grants at the beginning of stock based compensation expense is allocated to the general and administrative and exploration costs lines within the consolidated statements of operations and other comprehensive loss 
accretion of the asset retirement obligation in nevada and mexico remained consistent at million in and depreciation costs slightly increased to million in as compared to million in other income expenses 
other expenses totaled million for the year ended december  during  we sold  ounces of gold bullion and  ounces of silver bullion  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
we did not sell any gold or silver bullion in the same period in during the year december   we also reported unrealized losses on silver of million as a result of a reduction in the value of silver 
during  we recorded a foreign currency exchange loss of million  as compared to a gain of million in  reflecting a stronger us dollar against the canadian dollar and its effect on our net monetary assets or cash that are denominated in canadian dollars

the fair value of the consideration paid is allocated to the underlying identifiable net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values and any excess is recorded as goodwill 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment  and the utilization of independent valuation experts  and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  and asset lives  among other items 
transaction costs are expensed as incurred and are reported on the acquisition costs line within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
investments equity method and joint ventures we account for investments over which we exert significant influence using the equity method of accounting pursuant to asc topic investments  equity method and joint ventures 
under this method  our share of earnings and losses is included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss and the balance of the investment is adjusted by a like amount 
under the equity method  dividends received from an investee are recorded as decreases in the investment account  not as income 
where there has been a loss in value that is other than a temporary decline  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 

table of contents stockpiles  ore on leach pads  in process inventory  precious metals inventory and materials and supplies stockpiles  ore on leach pads  and in process inventory are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value  if commercial production is achieved 
for accounting purposes  we achieved commercial production for el gallo phase during the third quarter of after the initial gold pour in late september 
net realizable value represents the estimated future sales price of the product based on current and long term metals prices  less the estimated costs to complete production and bring the product to sale 
write downs of stockpiles  ore on leach pads  in process inventory  precious metals inventory and materials and supplies  resulting from net realizable value impairments  are reported as a component of production costs applicable to sales 
the current portion of stockpiles  ore on leach pad  in process inventory and materials and supplies is determined based on the expected amounts to be processed within the next months 
stockpiles  ore on leach pads  in process inventory and materials and supplies not expected to be processed within the next months  if any  are classified as long term 
stockpiles represent ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by estimating the number of tonnes added and removed from the stockpile  an estimate of the contained metals based on assay data and the estimated metallurgical recovery rates 
costs are allocated to stockpiles based on relative values of material stockpiled and processed using current mining costs incurred up to the point of stockpiling the ore 
material is removed from the stockpile at an average cost per tonne 
since we only achieved commercial production for accounting purposes in september  no value was allocated to stockpiles prior to the month of september ore on leach pads is the ore that is placed on pads where it is treated with a chemical solution that dissolves the gold contained in the ore over a period of months 
costs are attributed to the ore on leach pads based on current mining costs incurred up to the point of placing the ore on the pad 
costs are removed from the leach pad based on the average cost per estimated recoverable ounce of gold on the leach pad as the gold is recovered 
the estimates of recoverable gold on the leach pads are calculated from the quantities of ore placed on the leach pads  the grade of ore placed on the leach pads and a recovery percentage 
the quantities of recoverable gold placed on the leach pads are reconciled to the quantities of gold actually recovered metallurgical balancing  by comparing the grades of ore placed on the leach pads to actual ounces recovered 
the nature of the leaching process inherently limits the ability to precisely monitor inventory levels 
as a result  the metallurgical balancing process is constantly monitored and the engineering estimates are refined based on actual results over time 
in process inventories represent materials that are currently in the process of being converted to a saleable product 
the el gallo phase conversion process is an adsorption desorption recovery adr processing plant utilizing carbon columns for recovery 
in process material is measured based on assays of the material fed into the process and the projected recoveries of the respective plants 
in process inventories are valued at the average cost of the material fed into the process attributable to the source material coming from the mines  stockpiles and or leach pads plus the in process conversion costs incurred to that point in the process 
precious metal inventory includes gold bullion that is unsold and held at the refinery and is valued at the lower of average mining cost or net realizable value 
materials and supplies inventories are comprised of chemicals  reagents and consumable parts used in drilling and other operating activities 
they are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
cost includes applicable taxes and freight 
proven and probable reserves the definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in the sec industry guide proven reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed 
table of contents from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geological character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of the reserves are well established 
probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observations 
as of december   except for our interest in the san jos mine  none of our other mineralized properties contain resources that satisfy the definition of proven and probable reserves 
design  construction  and development costs certain costs to design and construct mining and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves 
prior to commercial production for accounting purposes in september  we classified the phase development of the el gallo complex as an exploration stage project since no sec guide proven or probable reserves have been established  and accordingly  substantially all costs  including design  engineering  construction  and installation of equipment were expensed as incurred 
certain types of equipment  which have alternative uses or significant salvage value  may be capitalized without proven and probable reserves 
if a project commences commercial production  amortization and depletion of capitalized costs for such equipment would be computed on a unit of production basis over the expected reserves of the project based on estimated recoverable ounces 
mine development costs include engineering and metallurgical studies  drilling and other related costs to delineate an ore body  the removal of overburden to initially expose an ore body at open pit surface mines and the building of access ways  shafts  lateral access  drifts  ramps and other infrastructure at underground mines 
development costs are capitalized when proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially minable property 
mine development costs incurred either to develop new ore deposits  expand the capacity of operating mines  or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are capitalized 
costs of start up activities and costs incurred to maintain current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations as incurred 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
all capitalized costs are amortized using the units of production method over the estimated life of the ore body based on recoverable ounces to be mined from proven and probable reserves 
as of december   except for our interest in the san jos mine  development costs are not capitalized at any of our properties  as no proven and probable reserves exist 
property and equipment expenditures for new facilities or equipment and expenditures that extend the useful lives of existing facilities or equipment are capitalized and recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using straight line methods 
office furniture  equipment and light vehicles are being depreciated over the estimated economic lives ranging from to years 
trailers  heavy vehicles and other site equipment are being depreciated over estimated economic lives from to years 
buildings are being depreciated over an estimated economic life of years 
all mining equipment is depreciated using the units of production method based upon estimated proven and probable reserves 
impairment of long lived assets we review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the net book value to fair value 
when the net book value exceeds fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recorded 
mineral properties are monitored for impairment based on factors such as our continued right to explore the area  exploration reports  assays  technical reports  drill results and its continued plans to fund exploration programs on the property 
we use the market approach to estimate the fair value of the properties by using a 
table of contents combination of the observed market value per square mile in the region and an observed market value per ounce of mineralized material 
we are unable to estimate undiscounted future net cash flows from its operations due to the absence of proven and probable reserves 
as such  the appropriate evidence to perform estimates of future cash flows is not available and may not be accurate in supporting the company long lived assets 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  we group our properties by geological mineral complex  as this represents the lowest level at which we allocate our exploration spending independent of other assets and liabilities 
mineral property interests mineral property interests include acquired mineral  development and exploration stage properties  which are considered tangible assets 
the amount capitalized relating to a mineral property interest represents its fair value at the time of acquisition  either as an individual asset purchase or as a part of a business combination 
the value of mineral property interest is primarily driven by the nature and amount of mineralized material believed to be contained in the properties 
if a mineable ore body is discovered  the capitalized costs would be amortized when production begins using the units of production method 
exploration costs exploration costs include costs incurred to identify new mineral resources  evaluate potential resources  and convert mineral resources into proven and probable reserves 
exploration costs are expensed as incurred 
asset retirement obligations we record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation aro in the period that it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
ongoing environmental and reclamation expenditures are credited to the aro as incurred to the extent they relate to the aro and to expense to the extent they do not apply 
the fair value of aros is measured by discounting the expected cash flows using a discount factor that reflects the credit adjusted risk free rate of interest  while taking into account an inflation rate 
we prepare estimates of the timing and amounts of expected cash flows when an aro is incurred  which are updated to reflect changes in facts and circumstances 
changes in regulations or laws  any instances in non compliance with laws or regulations that result in fines  or any unforeseen environmental contamination could result in a material impact to the amounts charged to earnings for reclamation and remediation 
significant judgments and estimates are made when estimating the fair value of aros 
expected cash flows relating to aros could occur over long periods of time and the assessment of the extent of environmental remediation work is highly subjective 
considering all of these factors that go into the determination of an aro  the fair value of the aros can materially change over time 
revenue recognition revenue includes sales value received for our principal products  gold and silver 
revenue is recognized when title to gold and silver passes to the buyer and when collectability is reasonably assured 
title passes to the buyer based on terms of the sales contract 
revenues from by product sales are credited to production cost applicable to sales 
product pricing is determined at the point revenue is recognized by reference to active and freely traded commodity markets  for example  the london bullion market for both gold and silver  in an identical form to the product sold 
we entered into a dor sales agreement  whereby we have the option to sell approximately of the gold and silver contained in dor bars produced at the el gallo complex prior to the completion of refining  which refining normally takes business days 
royalty expense we have a net smelter return nsr royalty agreement with a third party on all phase metals production and a portion of expected future phase metals production from the el gallo complex 
the terms of the royalty agreement stipulate that production up to  of gold and gold equivalent ounces are subject to a nsr  production between  to  of gold and gold equivalent ounces are subject to a nsr  and thereafter 
currently we are subject to the nsr 
under the terms of the royalty agreement  the royalty holder has the option to settle the 
table of contents nsr payment in cash or gold and gold equivalent ounces 
the royalty holder has indicated a preference to settle the nsr payment in gold and gold equivalent ounces which would be calculated on the day the refiner credits our metals account 
based on the terms of the royalty agreement  we have produced approximately  of gold and gold equivalent ounces through december  royalty expense is included in production costs applicable to sales 
stock based compensation we account for stock options at fair value as prescribed in asc section we estimate the fair value of each stock option at the grant date by using the black scholes option pricing model and provide for expense recognition over the service period  if any  of the stock option 
income taxes we account for income taxes under asc section using the liability method  recognizing certain temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of our liabilities and assets and the related income tax basis for such liabilities and assets 
this method generates either a net deferred income tax liability or asset for the company  as measured by the statutory tax rates in effect 
we derive the deferred income tax charge or benefit by recording the change in either the net deferred income tax liability or asset balance for the year 
we record a valuation allowance against any portion of those deferred income tax assets when we believe  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risks includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  equity price risks  commodity price fluctuations  and country risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk 

table of contents foreign currency risk while we transact most of our business in us dollars  some expenses  labor  operating supplies and property and equipment are denominated in canadian dollars  mexican pesos or argentine pesos 
as a result  currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs 
the appreciation of non us dollar currencies against the us dollar increases costs and the cost of purchasing property and equipment in us dollar terms in canada  mexico and argentina  which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows 
conversely  a depreciation of non us dollar currencies usually decreases operating costs and property and equipment purchases in us dollar terms in foreign countries 
the value of cash and cash equivalents denominated in foreign currencies also fluctuates with changes in currency exchange rates 
appreciation of non us dollar currencies results in a foreign currency gain on such investments and a depreciation in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
we have not utilized market risk sensitive instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates but may in the future actively manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we hold a significant portion of our cash reserves in canadian dollar 
based on our canadian cash balance of million at december   a change in the canadian dollar would result in a gain loss of million being recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
interest rate risk we have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short term investments 
accordingly  we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time 
equity price risk we have in the past sought and will likely in the future seek to acquire additional funding by sale of common stock 
movements in the price of our common stock have been volatile in the past and may also be volatile in the future 
as a result  there is a risk that we may not be able to sell common stock at an acceptable price to meet future funding requirements 
commodity price risk we own a interest in the san jos mine  an operating silver gold mine in santa cruz  argentina  and we have commenced production of gold and silver from our owned el gallo complex 
as a result  changes in the price of gold and silver could significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows in the future 
we also hold a portion of our treasury in gold and silver bullion  which is recorded at the lower of cost or market 
gold and silver prices may fluctuate widely from time to time 
based on our gold and silver holdings of million at december   a reduction in the price of gold and silver would decrease our working capital by approximately million 
at december   our gold and silver bullion had a combined fair value of million 
credit risk we may be exposed to credit loss through our dor sales agreements with canadian financial institutions if these institutions are unable to make payment in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
we do not anticipate any of the financial institutions to default on their obligation 
as of december  we did not have any significant credit exposure associated with our dor sales agreements 
in mexico  we are exposed to credit loss regarding our iva taxes receivable  if the mexican tax authorities are unable to make payments in accordance with our monthly filings 
collection time on 
table of contents iva receivable is uncertain 
the risk is mitigated to the extent that the iva receivable balance can be applied to future taxes payable 
however  at this time we are uncertain when our mexican operations will generate sufficient taxable operating profits to offset this receivable against taxes payable 
as at december   we continue to face credit risk on the collection of our iva receivables 
subsequent to december   we received million of the million receivable reported as at december  foreign country risk our el gallo project and certain other concessions are located in mexico  and are subject to mexican federal and state laws and regulations 
as a result  our mining investments are subject to the risks normally associated with the conduct of business in foreign countries 
in the past  mexico has been subject to political instability  changes and uncertainties which may cause changes to existing government regulations affecting mineral exploration and mining activities 
civil or political unrest or violence could disrupt our operations at any time 
in  there continues to be a high level of violence and crime relating to drug cartels in sinaloa state  where we operate  and in other regions of mexico 
this may disrupt our ability to carry out exploration and mining activities and affect the safety and security of our employees and contractors 
our exploration and mining activities may be adversely affected in varying degrees by changing government regulations relating to the mining industry or shifts in political conditions that could increase the costs related to our activities or maintaining our properties 
presidential and congressional elections were held in july with enrique pena nieto from the institutional revolutionary party pri winning the presidency and the pri winning the most seats but failing to win a majority in congress 
the new president took office in december it is indeterminate what effect  if any  these political changes will have on our ability to operate in mexico 
we also have material properties located in argentina 
there are risks relating to an uncertain or unpredictable political and economic environment in argentina 
during an economic crisis in and  argentina defaulted on foreign debt repayments and on the repayment on a number of official loans to multinational organizations 
in addition  the argentinean government has renegotiated or defaulted on contractual arrangements 
in january  the argentinean government reassessed its policy and practice in respect of export duties and began levying export duties on mining companies operating in the country 
although this particular change did not affect msc as their fiscal stability agreement explicitly fixes export duties at for dor bars and for concentrates  there can be no assurance that the argentinean government will continue to honor such or other fiscal stability agreements and will not unilaterally take other action which could have a material adverse effect on our interests in argentina  including in particular the san jos mine 
in october  argentina announced a decree requiring mining companies to repatriate mining revenues to argentine currency before distributing revenue either locally or overseas 
msc estimated that this would result in an additional million in its annual pre tax operating expenses on a basis as a result of the increased foreign exchange and bank transaction costs caused by the issuance of this decree 
in april  the government of argentina and their central bank announced further rules which initially reduced the number of days mining companies have to repatriate funds to days and then subsequently in july  relaxed the repatriation requirement to days on the sale of dor and days on the sale of concentrates for certain mining companies including msc 
during this interim period of uncertainty  there was a disruption to msc exports  especially concentrate sales which take significantly longer than dor to process 
in april  argentina president announced the nationalization of the majority stake of yacimientos petrol feros fiscales ypf  argentina largest oil company 
other unanticipated changes by the argentinean government could negatively impact the profitability of the san jos mine or affect our ability to explore or develop our los azules project or other exploration properties in argentina 
political and economic events such as acts  or failures to act  by a government authority in argentina  and acts of political violence in argentina  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate
