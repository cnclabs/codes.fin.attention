critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate 
the most significant accounting policies we follow are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
these factors include among other things  whether the policy requires management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the accounting policies which we believe to be most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements are those that are related to the determination of the reserve for credit losses  fair value estimates  leased asset residual values  and income taxes 
reserve for credit losses a consequence of lending activities is that we may incur credit losses 
the amount of such losses will vary depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan and lease portfolio as affected by economic conditions such as rising interest rates and the financial performance of borrowers 
the reserve for credit losses consists of the allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve 
the allowance provides for probable and estimable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is increased or decreased through the provisioning process 
there is no exact method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan and lease portfolio 
the unfunded reserve is a component of other liabilities and represents the estimate for probable credit losses inherent in unfunded commitments to extend credit 
the level of the unfunded reserve is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in other noninterest expense 
management evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses is often the most critical of accounting estimates for a financial institution 
our determination of the amount of the reserve for credit losses is a critical accounting estimate as it requires 
table of contents significant reliance on the accuracy of credit risk ratings on individual borrowers  the use of estimates and significant judgment as to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  significant reliance on estimated loss rates on homogenous portfolios  and consideration of our quantitative and qualitative evaluation of economic factors and trends 
while our methodology in establishing the reserve for credit losses attributes portions of the allowance and unfunded reserve to the commercial and consumer portfolio segments  the entire allowance and unfunded reserve is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio and total amount of unfunded credit commitments  respectively 
the reserve for credit losses related to our commercial portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to the accuracy of credit risk ratings assigned to each borrower 
commercial loan risk ratings are evaluated based on each situation by experienced senior credit officers and are subject to periodic review by an independent internal team of credit specialists 
the reserve for credit losses related to our consumer portfolio segment is generally most sensitive to economic assumptions and delinquency trends 
the reserve for credit losses attributable to each portfolio segment also includes an amount for inherent risks not reflected in the historical analyses 
relevant factors include  but are not limited to  concentrations of credit risk geographic  large borrower  and industry  economic trends and conditions  changes in underwriting standards  experience and depth of lending staff  trends in delinquencies  and the level of criticized and classified loans

fair value measurements fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument is dependent upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market inputs 
for financial instruments that are traded actively and have quoted market prices or observable market inputs  there is minimal subjectivity involved in measuring fair value 
however  when quoted market prices or observable market inputs are not fully available  significant management judgment may be necessary to estimate fair value 
in developing our fair value measurements  we maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy defines level and valuations as those that are based on quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets and quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market 
level valuations are based on model based techniques that use at least one significant assumption not observable in the market 
these unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
financial assets that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include available for sale investment securities  loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights  investments related to deferred compensation arrangements  and derivative financial instruments 
as of december  and  billion or and billion or  respectively  of our total assets consisted of financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and most of these financial assets consisted of available for sale investment securities measured using information from a third party pricing service 
these investments in debt securities and mortgage backed securities were all classified in either levels or of the fair value hierarchy 
financial liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of derivative financial instruments 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of our total liabilities consisted of financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
as of december  and  level financial assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were million and million  respectively  or less than of our total assets  and was comprised of mortgage servicing rights and derivative financial instruments 
as of december  and  level financial liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis were million and million  respectively  or less than of our total liabilities  and was comprised of derivative financial instruments 
our third party pricing service makes no representations or warranties that the pricing data provided to us is complete or free from errors  omissions  or defects 
as a result  we have processes in place to monitor and periodically review the information provided to us by our third party pricing service such as our third party pricing service provides us with documentation by asset class of inputs and methodologies used to value securities 
we review this documentation to evaluate the inputs and valuation methodologies used to place securities into the appropriate level of the fair value hierarchy 
this documentation is periodically updated by our third party pricing service 
accordingly  transfers of securities within the fair value hierarchy are made if deemed necessary 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the pricing information received from our third party 
table of contents pricing service 
this review process includes a comparison to non binding third party broker quotes  as well as a review of market related conditions impacting the information provided by our third party pricing service 
we also identify investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades relative to historic levels  as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets 
as of december  and  management did not make adjustments to prices provided by our third party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets 
on a quarterly basis  management also reviews a sample of securities priced by the company third party pricing service to review significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used 
based on this review  management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted 
on an annual basis  to the extent available  we obtain and review independent auditor reports from our third party pricing service related to controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness 
we did not note any significant control deficiencies in our review of the independent auditor reports related to services rendered by our third party pricing service 
our third party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices 
periodically  we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third party pricing service 
our third party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us 
our third party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going forward basis 
based on the composition of our investment securities portfolio  we believe that we have developed appropriate internal controls and performed appropriate due diligence procedures to prevent or detect material misstatements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our fair value measurements 
leased asset residual values lease financing receivables include a residual value component  which represents the estimated value of leased assets upon lease expiration 
our determination of residual value is derived from a variety of sources  including equipment valuation services  appraisals  and publicly available market data on recent sales transactions on similar equipment 
the length of time until lease termination  the cyclical nature of equipment values  and the limited marketplace for re sale of certain leased assets  are important variables considered in making this determination 
we update our valuation analysis on an annual basis  or more frequently as warranted by events or circumstances 
when we determine that the fair value is lower than the expected residual value at lease expiration  the difference is recognized as an asset impairment in the period in which the analysis is completed 
income taxes we determine our liabilities for income taxes based on current tax regulation and interpretations in tax jurisdictions where our income is subject to taxation 
currently  we file tax returns in nine federal  state and local domestic jurisdictions  and four foreign jurisdictions 
in estimating income taxes payable or receivable  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of each tax position 
accordingly  previously estimated liabilities are regularly reevaluated and adjusted  through the provision for income taxes 
changes in the estimate of income taxes payable or receivable occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax law  the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance that impact the relative merits and risks of each tax position 
these changes  when they occur  may affect the provision for income taxes as well as current and deferred income taxes  and may be significant to our statements of income and condition 
management determination of the realization of net deferred tax assets is based upon management judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income  as well as the implementation of various tax planning strategies to maximize realization of the deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of december  and  we carried a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively  related to our deferred tax assets established in connection with our low income housing investments 
we are also required to record a liability  referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit utb  for the entire amount of benefit taken in a prior or future income tax return when we determine that a tax position has a less than likelihood of being accepted by the taxing authority 
as of december  and  our liabilities for utbs were million and million  respectively

the statewide seasonally adjusted unemployment rate continued to decline during the fourth quarter of as well 
the underlying risk profile of our lending portfolio continued to improve in as a result of these improvements in economic trends and credit quality trends in our portfolio 
higher risk loans and leases although asset quality has improved in recent years  we remain vigilant in light of the uncertainties in the us economy as well as concerns related to specific segments of our lending portfolio that present a higher risk profile 
as of december   the higher risk segments within our loan and lease portfolio continue to be concentrated in residential land loans  certain home equity loans  and air transportation leases 
in addition  loans and leases based on hawaiian islands other than oahu the neighbor islands may present a higher risk profile as the neighbor islands have continued to experience higher levels of unemployment and have shown signs of slower economic recovery when compared to oahu 
table summarizes the amount of our loan and lease portfolio that demonstrate a higher risk profile 
the allowance associated with these higher risk loans and leases is consistent with our methodologies for each of the respective loan or lease classes

table of contents as of december   our higher risk loans and leases outstanding decreased by million or from december  we previously reported a segment of our residential home building loans as representing a higher risk profile 
however  as of december   this segment of our residential home building loans has significantly decreased and now represents an exposure of approximately million due to payments and improved borrower financial performance 
as such  we no longer consider this segment of our residential home building loans to be a reportable higher risk loan segment 
residential land loans in our residential mortgage portfolio consist of consumer loans secured by unimproved lots 
these loans often represent higher risk due to the volatility in the value of the underlying collateral 
our residential land loan portfolio was million as of december   of which million related to properties on the neighbor islands 
the decrease in our higher risk exposure in this portfolio in was primarily due to million in payments and million in gross loan charge offs 
residential land loans are collectively evaluated for impairment in connection with the evaluation of our residential mortgage portfolio

as of december   our higher risk home equity loans had a day past due delinquency ratio of 
in  million or of our gross charge offs of home equity loans were from our higher risk segment 
we consider all of our air transportation leases to be of higher risk due to the volatile financial profile of the industry 
domestic air transportation carriers continue to demonstrate a higher risk profile due to fuel costs  pension plan obligations  consumer demand  and marginal pricing power 
carriers are migrating to newer generations of more fuel efficient fleets  which are negatively impacting older generation aircraft valuations 
we believe that these risks  coupled with a slowly recovering economy  could place additional pressure on the financial health of air transportation carriers for the foreseeable future

outstanding credit exposure related to our air transportation leases was million as of december   a decrease of million or compared to the balance as of december  in  we sold one aircraft and terminated the lease  and transferred one aircraft to equipment held for sale  a component of other assets  at the lease termination date

as of december   the allowance associated with the remaining balance of our air transportation leases was million or of outstanding balances  a decrease of million from december  in  there were no delinquencies in our air transportation leasing portfolio and no charge offs were recorded

our npas were million as of december   compared to million as of december  this decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in residential mortgage non accrual loans 
the largest component of our npas continues to be centered in residential mortgage loans  which generally take longer to resolve through the judicial foreclosure process

we have evaluated these loans for impairment and have recorded partial charge offs totaling million on two of these loans 
commercial mortgage non accrual loans increased by million from december  to million as of december  this increase was due to the addition of three loans 
as of december   the balance consists of six borrowers 
we have evaluated these loans for impairment and have recorded a partial charge off of million on one of the loans 
construction non accrual loans decreased by million from december  to million as of december  this decrease was primarily due to million in payments and million in partial charge offs related to one construction loan

residential mortgage non accrual loans decreased by million from december  to million as of december   primarily due to million in payments  partially offset by million in additions to non accrual status 
residential mortgage non accrual loans remain at elevated levels due mainly to the timeframe required to complete a judiciary foreclosure

foreclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans 
foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value  less estimated selling costs  at the time of foreclosure 
on an ongoing basis  properties are appraised as required by market indications and applicable regulations 
foreclosed real estate increased by million from december  to million as of december  this increase was primarily due to the foreclosure of residential properties in as of december   included in foreclosed real estate are one commercial property and eight residential properties  six of which are located in the state of hawaii 
five of the residential properties were sold in resulting in a nominal gain 
impaired loans are defined as those which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  as well as those loans whose terms have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring tdr 
impaired loans were million as of december   compared to million as of december  impaired loans had a related allowance of million as of december  and million as of december  as of december   we have recorded charge offs of million related to our impaired loans 
if interest due on the balances of all non accrual loans as of december  had been accrued under the original terms  approximately million in total interest income would have been recorded in  compared to the million recorded as interest income on those loans

based on our ongoing assessment of credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio and the current economic environment  our allowance was million as of december   a decrease of million or from december  the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases outstanding was  a basis point decrease from december  the decrease in the ratio of the allowance to total loans and leases in was commensurate with improvements in credit quality and an improving economy in hawaii 
with continued improvement in the hawaii economy and in our credit quality  including reductions in our higher risk loan and lease segments  we may require a lower level of the allowance in future periods 
net loan and lease charge offs were million or of total average loans and leases in  a decrease from million or of total average loans and leases in net loans and leases charged off decreased in all of our commercial and consumer lending portfolios  except the construction portfolio  during commercial net recoveries were million in  primarily resulting from a lower level of charge offs in our commercial and industrial portfolio 
consumer net charge offs were million in  a decrease of million from this decrease was primarily in our residential mortgage and home equity portfolios 

table of contents the components of the allowance  including the allocation between commercial and consumer categories is based on an evaluation of individual credits  historical loan and lease loss experience  management evaluation of the current loan portfolio  and current economic conditions 
the allocation of the allowance to our commercial portfolio segment decreased by million or from december  primarily due to a reduction in our allocation to our air transportation lease exposure 
relative to our total loan and lease portfolio  our domestic air transportation leases continue to demonstrate a higher risk profile as evidenced by recent airline bankruptcies and continued high fuel prices 
we have decreased the allocation of the allowance to all classes of our commercial portfolio segment  except commercial mortgage  due to lower portfolio segment risk 
the increase in the allocation to the commercial mortgage class was primarily due to portfolio growth 
the allocation of the allowance to our consumer portfolio segment decreased by million or from december  primarily due to lower levels of risk across all classes in this portfolio segment 
however  we increased our allocation of the allowance to our other consumer class of loans and leases by million or from december  primarily due to the recent announcement of planned branch closures in american samoa and past experience with increased delinquencies and defaults from similar closures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the allowance and credit quality indicators 
reserve for unfunded commitments the unfunded reserve was million as of december   unchanged from december  the process used to determine the unfunded reserve is consistent with the process for determining the allowance  as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities or loan and lease equivalency factors 
market risk market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices 
we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
our market risk management process involves measuring  monitoring  controlling  and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition 
in this management process  market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance  while limiting volatility 
our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk the objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity 
the potential cash flows  sales  or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities  especially those that earn or pay interest  are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
this interest rate risk arises primarily from our normal business activities of gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates  such as general economic and financial conditions  customer preferences  historical pricing relationships  and repricing characteristics of financial instruments 
our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the us and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the monetary policies of the frb can influence the overall growth of loans  investment securities  and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities 
the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable 
in managing interest rate risk  we  through the asset liability management committee alco  measure short and long term sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
the alco  which is comprised of members of executive management  utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk  which include adjusting the balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities  changing product pricing strategies  modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio  or using derivative financial instruments 

table of contents the use of derivative financial instruments  as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  has generally been limited 
this is due to natural on balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
in particular  the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the alco 
we utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures 
expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk 
thus  as interest rates change  we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk 
a key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet 
the model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these estimates are based on assumptions on the behavior of loan and deposit pricing  repayment rates on mortgage based assets  and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments 
the model analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits 
while such assumptions are inherently uncertain  we believe that these assumptions are reasonable 
we utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates 
table presents  for the twelve months subsequent to december  and  an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates  moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve  relative to the measured base case scenario 
the base case scenario assumes that the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged 
based on the net interest income simulation as of december   net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates as of december  was more sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to the sensitivity profile as of december  as a result of our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration  net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise 
economic conditions and government intervention continue to result in interest rates remaining relatively low 
net interest income sensitivity profile table impact on future annual net interest income dollars in thousands december  december  gradual change in interest rates basis points immediate change in interest rates basis points to analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner  non parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated 
these non parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time 
conversely  if the yield curve should steepen  net interest income may increase 
other market risks in addition to interest rate risk  we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions 
foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk 
these transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers 
our trust and asset management income are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets  particularly debt and equity securities 
also  our share based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of the stock options and restricted stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of both stock options and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the parent common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets  general economic conditions  and other factors 

table of contents liquidity risk management the objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient  reasonably priced funds 
funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings  deposit growth  liability issuances and settlements  and off balance sheet funding commitments 
we consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity 
based on periodic liquidity assessments  we may alter our asset  liability  and off balance sheet positions 
the alco monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change 
this process  combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements  provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk 
in an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs  we actively manage our assets and liabilities 
we have immediate liquid resources in cash and noninterest bearing deposits and funds sold 
the potential sources of short term liquidity include interest bearing deposits as well as the ability to sell certain assets including available for sale investment securities 
short term liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to sell loans in the secondary market and to secure borrowings from the frb and fhlb 
short term liquidity is also generated from securities sold under agreements to repurchase  funds purchased  and short term borrowings 
our long term liquidity strategy is to be predominantly funded by deposits 
deposits have historically provided us with a long term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding 
additional funding is available through the issuance of long term debt 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds 
as of december   commercial and industrial and construction loans with an aggregate balance of million were due to mature in one year or less  although the bank may renew some of these lending arrangements if the risk profile is acceptable 
funds are also provided from payments on residential mortgage and other consumer loans 
additionally  investment securities of million were due to contractually mature in one year or less 
liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the fhlb and frb 
as of december   we could have borrowed an additional billion from the fhlb and an additional million from the frb based on the amount of collateral pledged 
we continued to maintain a strong liquidity position during as of december   cash and cash equivalents were million  available for sale investment securities were billion  and total deposits were billion 
as of december   we continued to maintain our excess liquidity primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by ginnie mae  state and municipal bond holdings  and in us treasury notes 
as of december   our available for sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of less than three years 
capital management we actively manage capital  commensurate with our risk profile  to enhance shareholder value 
we also seek to maintain capital levels for the company and the bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory well capitalized thresholds 
periodically  we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position 
the company and the bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a material effect on our financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures 
these measures were established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy 
as of december   the company and the bank were well capitalized under this regulatory framework 
the company regulatory capital ratios are presented in table below 
there have been no conditions or events since december  that management believes have changed either the company or the bank capital classifications 
as of december   shareholders equity was billion  an increase of million or from december  earnings for of million  common stock issuances of million  and shared based compensation of million were offset by cash dividends paid of million and other comprehensive loss of million 
in  we also repurchased million shares of our common stock under our share repurchase program at an average cost per share of and a total cost of million 
from the beginning of our share repurchase program in july through december   we repurchased a total of million shares of common stock and returned a total of billion to our shareholders at an average cost of per share 
as of december   remaining buyback authority under our share repurchase program was million of the total billion repurchase amount authorized by our board of directors 

table of contents from january  through february   the parent repurchased an additional  shares of common stock at an average cost of per share and a total cost of million 
remaining buyback authority was million as of february  the actual amount and timing of future share repurchases  if any  will depend on market and economic conditions  regulatory rules  applicable sec rules  and various other factors 
in january  the parent board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share on the parent outstanding shares 
the dividend will be payable on march  to shareholders of record at the close of business on february  we continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies  including basel iii and those required under the dodd frank act  as they continue to progress through the final rule making process 
see further discussion below on the potential impact that these regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital requirements

table of contents regulatory initiatives related to liquidity  capital  and stress testing basel iii on december   the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs released the final text of the basel iii package on capital  leverage  and liquidity reforms 
under basel iii  it is expected that financial institutions will be required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital 
it does so by increasing the minimum regulatory capital ratios  narrowing the definition of capital  and requiring capital buffers 
basel iii is also expected to impose a leverage ratio requirement  capital adjustments  and liquidity standards 
us federal banking agencies had been considering the bcbs capital guidelines and proposals  and in june  the us federal banking agencies jointly issued three notices of proposed rulemaking that are essentially intended to implement the bcbs capital guidelines for us banks 
the new minimum capital requirements were to be phased in between january and january as follows the minimum requirement for the tier common equity ratio was to be increased from the current to  the minimum requirement for the tier capital ratio to be considered adequately capitalized was to be increased from the current to  an additional of tier common equity to total risk weighted assets was to be required to be phased in between january  and january   and a minimum tier leverage ratio of was to be required 
however  on november   the us federal banking agencies indicated that a delay in implementation of the proposed dates was necessary  but did not provide a substitute effective date for the new rules 
the new capital adjustment rules are expected to be phased in between january and january in particular  these rules would change the treatment of net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investment securities in the calculation of tier capital 
currently  net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investment securities are excluded from the calculation of tier capital  which eliminates potential capital volatility 
under the proposed rules  net unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investment securities would no longer be excluded from the calculation of tier capital 
the liquidity proposals under basel iii include a liquidity coverage ratio lcr to become effective january   a net stable funding ratio to become effective january   and a set of monitoring tools to establish minimum reporting requirements of financial institutions to their regulatory supervisors 
the lcr is intended to ensure that banks have sufficient high quality liquid assets hqla to sustain a significant liquidity stress scenario lasting days 
on january   the bcbs published changes to its release that included changes to the definition of the lcr 
the revisions to the lcr incorporate amendments to the definition of hqla and net cash outflows  which include an expansion in the range of assets eligible as hqla  and some refinements to the assumed inflow and outflow rates to better reflect actual experience in times of stress 
in addition  the bcbs agreed to a revised timetable for the phase in of the lcr 
specifically  the lcr will be introduced as planned on january   but the minimum requirement will begin at  rising in equal annual increments of percentage points to reach on january  this graduated approach is designed to ensure that the lcr can be introduced without disruption to the orderly strengthening of banking systems or the ongoing financing of economic activity 
the net stable funding ratio establishes a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on the liquidity characteristics of an institution assets and activities over a one year time horizon 
the net stable funding ratio is defined as the available amount of stable funding to the amount of required stable funding 
this ratio must be greater than 
stress testing the dodd frank act also requires federal banking agencies to issue regulations that require banks with total consolidated assets of more than billion to conduct and publish annual stress tests to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on the consolidated earnings and capital of a bank and certain related items over a nine quarter forward looking planning horizon  taking into account all relevant exposures and activities 
in october  the frb published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks with total consolidated assets of more than billion  but delayed the effective date until october the final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities  as well as rules governing controls  oversight and disclosure 
implementation of these new capital  liquidity  and stress testing requirements has created significant uncertainty with respect to the future requirements for financial institutions 

table of contents operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations  including  but not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  errors relating to transaction processing and technology  failure to adhere to compliance requirements  and the risk of cyber security attacks 
the risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation  and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
operational risk is inherent in all business activities  and management of this risk is important to the achievement of company goals and objectives 
the operating risk committee the orc provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the company 
we have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the orc  supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units 
our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the audit and risk committee of the board of directors 
while we believe that internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks  there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur 
on an ongoing basis  management reassesses operational risks  implements appropriate process changes  and invests in enhancements to its systems of internal controls 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees off balance sheet arrangements we hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities vies 
these unconsolidated vies are primarily low income housing partnerships 
variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity net asset value 
the primary beneficiary consolidates the vie 
we have determined that the company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities 
as a result  we do not consolidate these vies 
see discussion of our accounting policy related to vies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantees we sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to fannie mae 
we also pool federal housing administration fha insured and us department of veterans affairs va guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to ginnie mae 
the agreements under which we sell residential mortgage loans to fannie mae or ginnie mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with the fha and va contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans 
although these loans are primarily sold on a non recourse basis  we may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans where required documents are not delivered or are defective 
we also service substantially all of the loans we sell to investors in the secondary market 
each agreement under which we act as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for our actions and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by us when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements 
however  if we commit a material breach of obligations as servicer  we may be subject to various penalties which may include the repurchase of an affected loan 
see discussion of our risks related to representation and warranty provisions as well as our risks related to residential mortgage loan servicing activities in note to the consolidated financial statements

we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
as a result  our liability for utbs is not included in this disclosure 
amounts only include obligations related to the unfunded non qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan 
commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
our non cancelable operating leases and capital lease obligations are primarily related to branch premises  equipment  and a portion of the company headquarters building with lease terms extending through purchase obligations arise from agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
other contracts included in purchase obligations primarily consist of service agreements for various systems and applications supporting bank operations 
pension and postretirement benefit contributions represent the minimum expected contribution to the unfunded non qualified pension plan and postretirement benefit plan 
actual contributions may differ from these estimates
