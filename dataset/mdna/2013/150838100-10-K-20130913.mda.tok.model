item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent results and fiscal year end financial condition for the fiscal year ended june   total revenue increased to million from million during fiscal freight revenue  which excludes revenue from fuel surcharges  increased to million in fiscal from million in we generated net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal compared with net income of million  or per diluted share  for fiscal we believe that an improving economy and decreased industry wide trucking capacity in fiscal compared to fiscal were the major factors contributing to our increase in net income 
average freight revenue per loaded mile excluding fuel surcharge for increased to compared with per mile in average freight revenue per tractor per week increased at  in compared with  for  as an improvement in rates was partially offset by fewer miles per seated tractor 
our operating margin  excluding the effect of fuel surcharge which is calculated as the percentage of operating expenses net of fuel surcharge over trucking revenue  decreased slightly to for compared with for at june   our total balance sheet debt was million and our total stockholders equity was million  for a total debt to capitalization ratio of 
at june   we had million of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
revenue we generate substantially all of our revenue by transporting freight for our customers 
generally  we are paid by the mile or by the load for our services 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  other trucking related services  and warehousing services 
the main factors that affect our revenue are the revenue per mile we receive from our customers  the percentage of miles for which we are compensated  the number of tractors operating  and the number of miles we generate with our equipment 
these factors relate to  among other things  the us economy  inventory levels  the level of truck capacity in our markets  specific customer demand  the percentage of team driven tractors in our fleet  driver and independent contractor availability  and our average length of haul 
we eliminate fuel surcharges from revenue when calculating operating ratios and some of our operating data 
we believe that eliminating the impact of this sometimes volatile source of revenue affords a more consistent basis for comparing our results of operations from period to period 
expenses and profitability the main factors that impact our profitability on the expense side are the variable costs of transporting freight for our customers 
these costs include fuel expense  driver related expenses  such as wages  benefits  training  and recruitment  and independent contractor costs  which we record as purchased transportation 
expenses that have both fixed and variable components include maintenance and tire expense and our total cost of insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary with the miles we travel  but also have a controllable component based on safety  fleet age  efficiency  and other factors 
our main fixed cost is the acquisition and financing of long term assets  primarily revenue equipment 
we have other mostly fixed costs  such as our non driver personnel and facilities expenses 
in discussing our expenses as a percentage of revenue  we sometimes discuss changes as a percentage of revenue before fuel surcharges  in addition to absolute dollar changes  because we believe the high variable cost nature of our business makes a comparison of changes in expenses as a percentage of revenue more meaningful at times than absolute dollar changes 
the trucking industry has experienced significant increases in expenses over the past several years  in particular those relating to equipment costs  driver compensation  insurance  and fuel 
as the united states economy slowed down  many trucking companies were forced to lower freight rates to maintain satisfactory levels of equipment utilization 
as the economy continues to improve  we are increasing rates as contracts expire or as the spot quote market allows 
over the long term  we expect a limited pool of qualified drivers and intense competition to recruit and retain those drivers to constrain overall industry capacity  although we expect our recent efforts related to our driving school to improve our driver recruiting 
assuming a return to economic growth in us manufacturing  retail  and other high volume shipping industries  we expect to be able to raise freight rates in line with or faster than expenses 

table of contents revenue equipment we operate  tractors and  trailers 
of our tractors at june    were owned  were acquired under operating leases  were acquired under capital leases  and were provided by independent contractors including drivers in our lease purchase program 
of our trailers at june   were owned   were acquired under operating leases  and  were acquired under capital leases 
we use a combination of cash and leases to acquire our new tractors 
most of our new trailers are acquired with leases 
these leases generally run for a period of three years for tractors and seven years for trailers 
when we finance revenue equipment acquisitions with operating leases  rather than borrowings or capital leases  the interest component of our financing activities is recorded as an above the line operating expense on our statements of operations 
independent contractors provide a tractor and a driver and are responsible for all operating expenses in exchange for a fixed payment per mile 
when utilizing independent contractors  we do not have the capital outlay of purchasing the tractors 
the payments to independent contractors are recorded in purchased transportation and the payments for equipment under operating leases are recorded in revenue equipment rentals 
expenses associated with independent contractors  such as interest  depreciation  driver compensation  fuel  and other expenses are not incurred by the company 
based on these factors we evaluate our efficiency using our operating ratio as well as income before income taxes 
outlook looking forward  our profitability goal is to achieve and maintain an operating ratio of less than 
we expect this to require improvements in rate per mile and miles per tractor and decreased non revenue miles 
because a large percentage of our costs are variable  changes in revenue per mile affect our profitability to a greater extent than changes in miles per tractor 
for fiscal  the key factors that we expect to have the greatest effect on our profitability are our freight revenue per tractor per week which will be affected by the general freight environment  including the balance of freight demand and industry wide trucking capacity  our compensation of drivers  our cost of revenue equipment particularly in light of epa engine requirements  our fuel costs  and our insurance and claims 
we will seek to continue our strategy of engaging in targeted acquisitions to enhance our operations 
to overcome cost increases and improve our margins  we will need to achieve increases in freight revenue per tractor 
operationally  we will seek improvements in safety  driver recruiting  and retention 
our success in these areas primarily will affect revenue  driver related expenses  and insurance and claims expense 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating and freight revenue for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue operating expenses salaries  wages  and employee benefits fuel purchased transportation revenue equipment rentals operations and maintenance insurance and claims depreciation and amortization cost of products and services sold communication and utilities operating taxes and licenses general and other operating total operating expenses operating income other expense interest expense  net other expense income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income freight revenue is total operating revenue less fuel surcharges 
in this table  fuel surcharges are eliminated from revenue and subtracted from fuel expense 
the amounts were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight rates due to the recovering economy and reduced capacity 
average freight revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in fiscal from for fiscal  or 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in loaded miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal we expect our freight rates to maintain an upward trend through the end of the calendar year as industry capacity appears to continue to tighten 
while average seated tractor count had little variation between fiscal and fiscal  we expect average seated tractor count to improve as a result of the driver school and other recruiting efforts 
fuel surcharge revenue increased to million from million for fiscal and  respectively 
fuel surcharge increased as united states department of energy doe fuel prices from which our fuel surcharge is calculated increased  offset slightly by a decrease in loaded miles in fiscal revenue for our asset light segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or 
the increase is primarily related to increased revenues in our ltl and warehousing business offset by a decrease in brokerage revenues 
truckersbb was sold into a joint venture in february therefore  our share of the operations of truckersbb is recorded as equity in earnings in other income expense for all of fiscal and salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal this increase in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to increased administrative salaries  recruiting expense  and medical benefits expense 
there was an increase of approximately million for accelerated vesting of mr 
stephen russell s equity compensation in conjunction with his position change from chief executive officer and chairman of the board of directors to solely chairman of the board of directors 
the implementation of a driving school in march increased our recruiting expense 
these factors were partially offset by slightly lower driver payroll in the current year as a result of a decrease in company driver miles offset by an increase in pay per mile 
if we increase our company driver count as a percentage of our total fleet we expect salaries  wages  and employee benefits will increase as a result of a higher percentage of company drivers in our fleet  offset by reduced recruiting costs 
fuel expenses  without reduction for fuel surcharge revenue  decreased to million  or of operating revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue  for fiscal fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to higher freight and fuel surcharge revenue as noted above and a decrease in gallons purchased due to a decrease in total miles and our continued improvement in our average miles per gallon 
average doe fuel prices increased to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal we expect that our continued efforts to reduce idling and operate more fuel efficient tractors will continue to have a positive impact on our miles per gallon 
however  we expect this positive impact to be partially offset by increasing fuel costs per gallon  lower fuel economy on epa mandated new engines  and the use of more costly ultra low sulfur diesel fuel 
purchased transportation increased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal the increase is primarily related to increases in our independent contractor expense due to an increase in independent contractor miles for fiscal compared to fiscal independent contractors are drivers who cover all their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
the number of independent contractors increased to at june   compared with at june  we also had increases in intermodal transportation and third party logistic provider expense offset by a decrease in brokerage expense 
we expect purchased transportation to increase as we attempt to increase the number of independent contractors in our fleet and continue to increase our purchased transportation for brokerage and intermodal transportation 

table of contents operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category decreased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in average tractor age to years and average trailer age to years  as well as a decrease in costs associated with tractor maintenance as the number of tractors covered under warranty has increased and we incurred lower tire expense as we continued to refresh our fleets 
we expect our operations and maintenance expense to be similar to the current level going forward  subject to implementation of csa requirements that may impact these expenses 
insurance and claims expense increased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage  cargo  and workers compensation insurance 
these increases are attributable to an increase in liability claims and workers compensation claims due to an increase in the number and or severity of claims reported including loss development 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we continually review and adjust our insurance program to maintain a balance between premium expense and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
we expect our insurance and claims expense to be consistent with historical average amounts going forward 
however  this category will vary based upon the frequency and severity of claims  the level of self insurance  and premium expense 
depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and net gains losses on the sale of equipment  increased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  in fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal these increases are primarily related to a decrease in the gains recognized on the sale of equipment in fiscal compared to gains recognized on sales in fiscal revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 
we expect minimal gains for as our tractor and trailer refresh cycle is nearly complete 
accordingly  we expect depreciation and amortization to increase 
all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses 
accordingly  we have not provided a detailed discussion of such expenses 
our pretax margin  which we believe is a useful measure of our operating performance because it is neutral with regard to the method of revenue equipment financing that a company uses  increased to of operating revenue and of freight revenue for fiscal  from of operating revenue and of freight revenue for fiscal income taxes increased to million for fiscal  from to million for fiscal  resulting from a higher pre tax income 
due to the non deductible effects of our driver per diem pay structure  our tax rate will fluctuate from the standard federal rate in future periods as net income fluctuates 
going forward  we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately to 
as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal fiscal year ended june   compared with fiscal year ended june total revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal freight revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight rates  due to the slowly recovering economy and reduced capacity 
average freight revenue per loaded mile  excluding fuel surcharge  increased to in fiscal from for fiscal  or 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in loaded miles to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents fuel surcharge revenue increased to million from million for fiscal and  respectively 
fuel surcharge increased as cost per gallon of fuel increased offset slightly by a decrease in loaded miles throughout the year 
revenue for our asset light segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  or 
the increase is primarily related to increased revenues in our warehousing services 
truckersbb was sold into a joint venture in february therefore  our share of the operations of truckersbb is recorded as equity in earnings in other income expense only for march through june  which does not reflect revenue or operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations 
truckers bb is recorded as equity in earnings in other income expense for all of fiscal salaries  wages  and employee benefits were million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal this increase in salaries  wages  and benefits is largely due to increased administrative salaries  driver payroll  recruiting expense  and medical benefits expense 
driver payroll increased in fiscal as a result of an increase in company driver miles and a decrease in independent contractor miles  in comparison to fiscal fuel expenses  without reduction for fuel surcharge revenue  increased to million  or of operating revenue in fiscal  compared to million  or of operating revenue  for fiscal fuel expenses  net of fuel surcharge revenue of million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively  decreased to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal  compared to million  or of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases were attributable to higher freight and fuel surcharge revenue as noted above 
gallons purchased for fiscal were consistent with fiscal  while average fuel prices increased to per gallon for fiscal  from per gallon for fiscal purchased transportation increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal as a percentage of operating revenue  purchased transportation decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal  and increased to of freight revenue in fiscal  compared to of freight revenue in fiscal the increase in purchased transportation for fiscal is primarily related to increases in our third party services for brokerage and intermodal transportation as we continue to develop and increase those offerings 
offsetting these increases was a decrease in independent contractor settlements 
the number of independent contractors decreased to at june   compared with at june  independent contractors are drivers who cover all of their operating expenses fuel  driver salaries  maintenance  and equipment costs for a fixed payment per mile 
operations and maintenance consist of direct operating expense  maintenance  physical damage  and tire expense 
this category decreased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal  from million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal the decrease in fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in average tractor age to years and average trailer age to years  as well as a decrease in costs associated with tractor maintenance as tractors covered under warranty have increased  and lower tire expense as we continued to refresh our fleets

depreciation and amortization  consisting primarily of depreciation of revenue equipment and net gains losses on the sale of equipment  decreased to million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  in fiscal from million  or of operating revenue and of freight revenue  for fiscal these decreases are related to lower tractor depreciation expenses and an increase in the gains recognized on the sale of equipment in fiscal compared to gains recognized on sales in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in trailer depreciation 
revenue equipment held under operating leases is not reflected on our balance sheet and the expenses related to such equipment are reflected on our statements of operations in revenue equipment rentals  rather than in depreciation and amortization and interest expense  as is the case for revenue equipment that is financed with borrowings or capital leases 

table of contents all of our other expenses are relatively minor in amount  and there were no significant changes in these expenses

as a result of the factors described above  net income increased to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources trucking is a capital intensive business 
we require cash to fund our operating expenses other than depreciation and amortization  to make capital expenditures and acquisitions  and to repay debt  including principal and interest payments 
we frequently consider potential acquisitions  and if we were to consummate an acquisition  our cash requirements would increase and we may have to modify our expected financing sources for the purchase of tractors 
subject to any required lender approval  we may make additional acquisitions  although we do not have any specific acquisition plans at this time 
our principal sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations  bank borrowings  capital and operating lease financing of revenue equipment  and proceeds from the sale of used revenue equipment 
at june   our total balance sheet debt  including capital lease obligations  and current maturities  was million  compared million at june  as of june   we had on order trailers for delivery through fiscal there were no tractor orders as of june  these trailer orders represent a capital commitment of approximately million  before considering the proceeds of equipment dispositions 
in fiscal  we expect to purchase our trailers with both cash generated from operations and leases 
we believe we will be able to fund our operating expenses  as well as our limited commitments for the acquisition of revenue equipment given our average fleet age  over the next twelve months with a combination of cash generated from operations  borrowings available under secured equipment financing or our primary credit facility  equipment sales  and lease financing arrangements 
we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long term  and the availability of the needed capital will depend upon our financial condition and operating results and numerous other factors over which we have limited or no control  including prevailing market conditions and the market price of our common stock 
however  based on our operating results  anticipated future cash flows  current availability under our credit facility  expected capital expenditures  and sources of equipment lease financing that we expect will be available to us  we do not expect to experience significant liquidity constraints in the foreseeable future 
cash flows we generated net cash from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal from fiscal is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal  and million for fiscal the outflows of investing cash flow are a result of cash used for acquisitions and purchasing equipment  offset by cash provided by disposal and sale of equipment 
capital expenditures primarily for tractors and trailers totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal these increases are related to our equipment refresh cycle which was nearly completed during the year 
we generated proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal financing activity consists primarily of bank borrowings  bank payments  and payment of the principal component of capital lease obligations 

table of contents primary credit agreement in december  we entered into a new million five year revolving credit facility agented by bank of america  na the facility refinanced our previous credit facility and provides for ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
bank of america  na served as the lead arranger in the facility and wells fargo bank  na also participated in the new facility 
the facility provides for ongoing working capital needs and general corporate purposes 
in may  we increased our credit facility and extended the maturity 
at june   we were authorized to borrow up to million under this credit facility  which expires may the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either a base rate equal to bank of america  na prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on our lease adjusted total debt to ebitdar ratio 
at june   the credit facility had an outstanding balance of million and million utilized for letters of credit 
the facility is collateralized by the assets of all the us and canadian subsidiaries of the company 
we are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under our credit agreement and we were in compliance with these covenants at june  contractual obligations and commitments as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts  and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows cash requirements as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases lease residual value guarantees capital lease obligations sub total future purchase of revenue equipment employment and consulting agreements standby letters of credit total contractual and cash obligations includes interest 
the amounts reflected in the table do not include amounts that could become payable to our chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  under certain circumstances if their employment by the company is terminated 
inflation  new emissions control regulations  and fuel costs most of our operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations 
during the past three years  the most significant effects of inflation have been on revenue equipment prices and fuel prices 
new emissions control regulations and increases in commodity prices  wages of manufacturing workers  and other items have resulted in higher tractor prices 
we attempt to limit the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates  certain cost control efforts  and limiting the effects of fuel prices through fuel surcharges 

table of contents the engines used in our tractors are subject to emissions control regulations  which have substantially increased our operating expenses since additional and more stringent regulation began in as of june   our tractor fleet has engines compliant with stricter regulations regarding emissions that became effective in compliance with such regulations and newly proposed emission regulations is expected to increase the cost of new tractors and could impair equipment productivity  lower fuel mileage  and increase our operating expenses 
these adverse effects combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the vehicles equipped with the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values that will be realized from the disposition of these vehicles could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations as the regulations impact our business through new tractor purchases 
fluctuations in the price or availability of fuel  as well as hedging activities  surcharge collection  the percentage of freight we obtain through brokers  and the volume and terms of diesel fuel purchase commitments may increase our costs of operation  which could materially and adversely affect our profitability 
we impose fuel surcharges on substantially all accounts 
these arrangements may not fully protect us from fuel price increases and also may result in us not receiving the full benefit of any fuel price decreases 
as of june   we had up to of our estimated fuel purchases hedged through december with the use of these hedges and any additional future hedges  we may be forced to make cash payments under the hedging arrangements 
based on current market conditions  we have decided to limit our hedging and purchase commitments  but we continue to evaluate such measures 
the absence of meaningful fuel price protection through these measures could adversely affect our profitability and results of operation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and associated disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities are affected by these estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts  and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates and assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing estimates or assumptions 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following depreciation of property and equipment 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally use estimated useful lives of to years for new tractors and trailers  and estimated salvage values for new tractors and trailers generally range from to of the capitalized cost 
gains and losses on the disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation expense in our statements of operations 
we review the reasonableness of our estimates regarding useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and other long lived assets based upon  among other things  our experience with similar assets  conditions in the used equipment market  and prevailing industry practice 
changes in our useful life or salvage value estimates or fluctuations in market values that are not reflected in our estimates  could have a material effect on our results of operations 
revenue equipment and other long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
expected future cash flows are used to analyze whether an impairment has occurred 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the long lived asset  then an impairment loss is recognized 
we measure the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or the appraised or estimated market value of the asset  as appropriate 

table of contents claims reserves and estimates 
the primary claims arising for us consist of cargo liability  personal injury  property damage  collision and comprehensive  workers compensation  and employee medical expenses 
we maintain self insurance levels for these various areas of risk and have established reserves to cover these self insured liabilities 
we also maintain insurance to cover liabilities in excess of these self insurance amounts 
claims reserves represent accruals for the estimated uninsured portion of reported claims  including adverse development of reported claims  as well as estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators  and we refer to these estimates in establishing our reserves 
claims incurred but not reported are estimated based on our historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
in establishing our reserves we must take into account and estimate various factors  including  but not limited to  assumptions concerning the nature and severity of the claim  the effect of the jurisdiction on any award or settlement  the length of time until ultimate resolution  inflation rates in health care  and in general interest rates  legal expenses  and other factors 
our actual experience may be different than our estimates  sometimes significantly 
changes in assumptions as well as changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change in the near term 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
derivative instruments and hedging activity 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and fuel prices 
derivative financial instruments related to currency exchange rates and heating oil fuel prices include forward purchase and sale agreements which generally have terms no greater than months 
to account for our derivative financial instruments  we follow the provisions of asc topic  derivatives and hedging 
derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is designated and effective as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item 
these activities have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for the periods presented herein 
accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income taxes are determined in accordance with asc topic income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we evaluate our tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis and adjust these balances as appropriate 
we believe that we have adequately provided for our future tax consequences based upon current facts and circumstances and current tax law 
however  should our tax positions be challenged and not prevail  different outcomes could result and have a significant impact on the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets tax benefits expected to be realized in the future assumes that we will be able to generate  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be realized  based on forecasted income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our forecasts of future income 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a periodic basis and assess the need for additional valuation allowances 
federal income taxes are provided on that portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income asc topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu  which amends current comprehensive income guidance 
the company will be required to present significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required that provide additional detail about those amounts 
the amendment is effective prospectively for public entities in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk principally from our credit facility 
the credit facility carries a maximum variable interest rate based on either a base rate equal to the greater of the bank of america  na prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin between and that is adjusted quarterly based on the company lease adjusted total debt to ebitdar ratio 
at june   we had an outstanding balance of million related to our credit facility and million utilized for letters of credit 
a hypothetical increase in the bank base rate and libor would be immaterial to our net income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk  specifically in connection with our canadian operations 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our canadian operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in canadian dollars  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from canada 
as a result  increases in the canadian dollar exchange rate could adversely affect the profitability of our canadian operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our canadian operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  at june   we had outstanding foreign exchange derivative contracts in notional amounts of million with a fair value of these contracts approximately million less than the original contract value 
derivative gains losses  initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income  are reclassified to earnings in the period when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
while virtually all of the expenses associated with our mexican operations  such as independent contractor costs  company driver compensation  and administrative costs  are paid in mexican pesos  a significant portion of our revenue generated from those operations is billed in us dollars because many of our customers are us shippers transporting goods to or from mexico 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations 
assuming revenue and expenses for our mexican operations identical to the year ended june  both in terms of amount and currency mix  we estimate that a decrease in the mexican peso exchange rate would reduce our annual net income by approximately  we currently do not have any customer contracts outstanding payable in mexican pesos 
commodity price risk 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political  and market factors that are outside of our control 
historically  we have sought to recover a portion of short term increases in fuel prices from customers through the collection of fuel surcharges 
however  fuel surcharges do not always fully offset increases in fuel prices 
in addition  from time to time we may enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
as of june   we had up to of our estimated fuel purchases hedged through december based on our expected fuel consumption for  a change in the related price of heating oil or diesel per gallon would not have a material financial impact  assuming no further changes to our fuel hedging program or our fuel surcharge recovery
