item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help readers of our financial statements understand our business  results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  the other sections of this annual report 
until the sale of all of our interests in kgs  we conducted our operations in two segments our more dominant exploration and production segment  and our significantly smaller midstream segment 
except as otherwise specifically noted  or as the context requires otherwise  and except to the extent that differences between these segments or our geographic segments are material to an understanding of our business taken as a whole  we present this md a on a consolidated basis 
our md a includes the following sections overview of quarter restatement a description of the restatement of our historical quarterly financial statements overview a general description of our business  the value drivers of our business  and key indicators highlights a summary of significant activities and events affecting quicksilver capital program a summary of our planned capital expenditures during financial risk management information about debt financing and financial risk management results of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our financial statements liquidity  capital resources and financial position an analysis of our cash flows  sources and uses of cash  contractual obligations and commercial commitments critical accounting estimates a discussion of critical accounting estimates that represent choices between acceptable alternatives and or require management judgments and assumptions 
overview of quarter restatement as part of our year end procedures  we concluded that the documentation for our derivatives designated during that had fair value on the dates they were initially designated as hedges failed to give consideration to all sources of ineffectiveness 
specifically  our documentation did not include an assessment of whether interest rate changes could cause the instruments to not be effective over the life of the contract  which was required given the presence of fair value at the date of hedge designation 
management had documented its assessment of interest rate risk in on similar derivatives and concluded its effect to be immaterial and  thus  did not document the risk in accordingly  these derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting in and their changes in value must be recognized in earnings 
because the derivatives did not qualify for hedge accounting  their inclusion in the us and canadian full cost ceiling was inappropriate 
thus  our full cost ceiling calculations were revised and resulted in restatements to impairment expense recognized in earlier quarters 
also  we determined that the deferred taxes used in our canadian ceiling test for the first two quarters of included temporary differences for non property related items 
we have restated the ceiling impairments from the interim quarters to correct for these inclusions 
the impairment expense that resulted from the ceiling calculation restatements also caused reductions to our depletion rates for the quarters and we have restated depletion expense 
income taxes have also been restated for each of the quarters to reflect the foregoing restated items 
the following table and subsequent section discuss the effect of the restatement for impacted line items on the consolidated statement of income loss for the first three quarters in amounts related to derivatives previously classified in other revenue have been reclassified to derivative gains losses  net 
the total impact to the income statement is shown in the supplemental selected quarterly financial statements included in item to this annual report

overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged primarily in the acquisition  exploration  development  and production of onshore oil and gas based in fort worth  texas 
we focus primarily on unconventional reservoirs where hydrocarbons may be found in challenging geological conditions such as fractured shales  coalbeds and tight sands 
we generate revenue  income and cash flows by producing and selling natural gas  ngls and oil 
we conduct acquisition  exploration  development  and production activities to replace the reserves that we produce 
at december   and of our proved reserves were natural gas and ngls  respectively 
consistent with one of our business strategies  we continue to develop our unconventional resources by applying our expertise to our development projects in our barnett shale asset  horseshoe canyon asset and horn river asset  which had  and  respectively  of our proved reserves at december  during  based on the success of our exploration in our horn river asset  we began to consider this a development area  particularly in the southern portion of our acreage 
our acreage in 
table of contents our horn river asset provides us the most immediate additional opportunity for further application of our unconventional resources expertise 
our focus for is on the execution of strategic transactions and the improvement of our capital structure through deleveraging and the extension of our debt maturities 
if we are successful with these priorities in  we would expect that we would focus on three other value drivers in the future reserve growth  production growth  and maximizing our operating margin 
our reserve growth depends on our ability to fund a drilling program 
it also relies on our ability to apply our technical and operational expertise to explore and develop unconventional reservoirs 
we strive to increase reserves and production through aggressive management of our operations and through relatively low risk developmental drilling 
all of our development and exploratory programs are aimed at providing us with opportunities to develop unconventional reservoirs 
we believe the acreage we hold in our core operating areas is well suited for production increases through developmental drilling 
we perform workover and infrastructure projects to reduce ongoing operating costs and enhance current and future production rates 
we regularly review the properties we operate to determine if steps can be taken to efficiently increase reserves and production 
in evaluating the results of our efforts  we consider the capital efficiency of our drilling program and also measure the following key indicators  whose recent results are shown below years ended december  organic reserve growth production volume bcfe cash flow from operating activities in millions diluted earnings loss per share this ratio is calculated by subtracting beginning of the year proved reserves from adjusted end of the year proved reserves and dividing by beginning of the year proved reserves 
adjusted end of the year reserves are calculated by adding back divested reserves and production and deducting acquired reserves from end of the year reserves 
during  quicksilver recognized substantial negative reserve revisions due to lower average sec commodity prices compared to prior periods 
as such  we recognized a tcfe negative revision for all of  which represents a decline compared to year end reserves 
organic reserve adds in were approximately bcfe  which represents less than growth from the modest level of reserve additions results from two main factors approximately of the gross wells drilled in the barnett shale in were pud locations at year end therefore  no new reserves were recognized for these pud locations after bringing them on line  and we did not recognize significant additional pud locations at year end due the influence of commodity prices on the five year development profile 
customarily  we would recognize additional pud locations to offset drilled locations during the year provided the new puds meet the sec standards  including the five year limitation 
the organic reserve growth ratio is a supplemental measure that we use to assess how successfully we are implementing our business strategy of pursuing disciplined organic growth 
we believe that total reserve growth is a multi year key value driver of which organic reserve growth is a component 
reserve estimation has inherent limitations which are detailed in our risk factors in item a and include assumptions regarding future production rates  timing and amount of future development expenditures  results of geological  geophysical  production and engineering data and economic factors 
any inaccuracies in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities of proved reserves 
item supplemental oil and gas information contains additional information about our reserves 
highlights joint venture update on december   we entered into an agreement with swepi lp to jointly develop our oil and gas interests in the niobrara formation of the sand wash basin and to establish an area of mutual interest ami covering in excess of  acres 
each party assigned to the other a working interest in the majority of its combined acreage so that each party owns a interest in more than  acres and has the right to a interest in any acquisition within the ami 
swepi paid us an equalization payment for of the acreage contributed by us in excess of the acreage that swepi contributed 
swepi is 
table of contents the operator of the majority of the jointly owned lands 
this relationship is strategic to the development of the niobrara asset as it created contiguous acreage blocks  which will lead to a more orderly and cost effective development of the basin 
quicksilver is engaged in confidential negotiations with a potential buyer to sell a non operated minority working interest in its barnett shale asset 
we continue our efforts to achieve a joint venture in our horn river asset in northeast british columbia  with the downstream marketing of the gas a top priority 
we plan minimal capital spending in our horn river asset pending completion of a joint venture 
horn river development we completed our first multi well pad in our horn river asset during june and july the initial instantaneous production results from these new wells ranged between mmcfd and mmcfd  which exceeded our expectations 
production was curtailed from the new eight well pad since august due to a delay in commissioning of a third party treating facility and limitations of surface equipment 
in december  we secured temporary alternative treating and transportation and increased gross production to mmcfd within days 
we do not have a firm date for when the new treating facility  at which we have firm capacity  will be operable  but we believe we have sufficient treating and transportation capacity in the interim to meet our needs 
on january   the canadian neb issued its report recommending against approval of ngtl komie north project  which included a mile pipeline that would connect ngtl alberta system to a meter station planned to be constructed on our acreage in the horn river basin 
we believe the neb recommendation against the komie north project will be adopted by the federal authority 
the neb concluded that the evidence presented at this time did not justify a inch line as proposed  however  its recommendation notwithstanding  the neb emphasized its belief in the long term prospects for development of the horn river basin 
we believe ngtl will undertake efforts to secure additional shipper support for this pipeline 
we had previously provided million in letters of credit  which were reduced to million during march we believe future financial assurances  upon a revised application  which we expect may be delayed by up to two years  would be reduced proportionately relative to additional shipper support 
likewise  we are planning to defer drilling in the horn river basin until and have the ability to defer construction of a natural gas treating facility until at least to coincide with the revised timelines for the komie north project 
our ability to sell gas at the station and aeco hubs has not been impacted by the neb recommendation  as its acreage is served by existing treating facilities and pipelines which today can accommodate in excess of billion cubic feet per day 
due to the pace of development in the basin by all producers  discounted excess capacity is available in the region to meet quicksilver needs 
emerging basins during  we drilled and completed three vertical wells in the sand wash basin using a variety of stimulation methods and drilled one well 
we are currently conducting exploratory activities and have eight producing wells as of december  during  we continued to build an oil prospective acreage position in the bone springs and wolfcamp formations in the midland and delaware basins in west texas 
our leases total  acres across reeves  pecos  jeff davis  upton and crockett counties 
we drilled and completed our first short lateral well in pecos county in august  which targeted the third bone springs formation  and we drilled and completed another short lateral well in upton county in december  which targeted the wolfcamp formation 
master limited partnership in february  we filed a form s with the sec to begin the registration and sale of limited partnership interests in a master limited partnership holding certain of our mature properties in our barnett shale asset 
we amended the registration statement in may to include financial statements for and to address comments received from the sec and again in june to include financial statements for the first quarter of and to address further comments received from the sec 
in july  we were informed that the sec had no further comments 
during the fourth quarter of we recognized an expense for the deferred filing fees associated with this offering since the transaction has been dormant since june this accounting treatment does not preclude us from updating the registration document at a later date and we will continue to monitor market conditions to assess the timing of an offering  which may be influenced by a joint venture covering our barnett shale asset 

table of contents significant contract revisions in august  we amended our combined credit agreements primarily to relax the financial covenants through the second quarter of specific changes to the combined credit agreements are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements in item capital program we expect our capital program to be spent in the following areas in millions barnett shale niobrara west texas total us horn river horseshoe canyon total canada corporate total company includes capitalized interest expense and capitalized internal costs 
we expect our production volume to be between and mmcfe per day 
financial risk management we have established internal control policies and procedures for managing risk within our organization 
the possibility of decreasing prices received for our natural gas  ngl and oil production is one of the several risks that we face 
we seek to manage this risk by entering into derivative contracts 
we have mitigated the downside risk of adverse price movements through the use of these derivatives but  in doing so  have also limited our ability to benefit from favorable price movements 
our commodity price strategy enhances our ability to execute our development and exploration programs  meet debt service requirements and pursue acquisition opportunities even in periods of price volatility or depression 
item a of this annual report contains details of our commodity price and interest rate risk management 

table of contents results of operations other us refers to the combined amounts for our operations in our niobrara asset  west texas asset and southern alberta asset 
revenue we aggregate production revenue and realized cash gains losses on derivatives not treated as hedges in measuring revenue from our oil and gas production

natural gas and ngl revenue for decreased from as a result of a decrease in both realized prices without hedging gains and production 
the decrease in natural gas volume from our barnett shale asset was primarily due to production declines resulting from the aging of existing wells and a reduction of our capital program related to our barnett shale asset 
on a lesser basis  natural gas production volumes were also impacted by temporary shut ins in support of new development activity 
natural gas revenue for decreased from despite a increase in production 
realized prices  before hedge settlements  were lower for as compared to  which more than offset production increases 
the increase in natural gas volume from our barnett shale asset was primarily the result of additional producing wells in our alliance asset to meet our eni commitment as well as production throughout the basin up lift from well work over activity 
the canadian natural 
table of contents gas production increase was primarily the result of two additional producing wells in our horn river asset that were brought on line in december the decrease in our horseshoe canyon asset production was the result of reduced capital spending and the aging of the field 
the increase in ngl revenue for resulted from an increase in both realized prices and in production primarily from our barnett shale asset compared to the increase in production resulted from additional producing wells and work over activity in the southern portion of the basin 
sales of purchased natural gas and costs of purchased natural gas years ended december  in thousands sales of purchased natural gas purchases from eni purchases from others total costs of purchased natural gas sold purchases from eni purchases from others unrealized valuation gain on gas purchase commitment total net sales and purchases of natural gas we purchase eni s interest in natural gas production in our alliance asset and then sell the natural gas to others 
the decrease from compared to is due to decreased production primarily as a result of fewer new wells brought online in and lower realized prices 
as the gas purchase commitment with eni expired on december   no unrealized valuation gain or loss was recognized for or derivative gains losses  net the following table summarizes our net derivative gains and losses years ended december  in thousands unrealized mark to market changes in fair value of natural gas derivative gains losses realized cash settlements of natural gas derivative gains non cash loss in fair value from restructured natural gas derivatives gain loss from hedge ineffectiveness derivative gains losses  net unrealized mark to market changes in fair value are subject to continuing market risk 
in we began to account for the fair value changes of certain natural gas derivatives in the income statement as reflected in the above table and discussed earlier in the overview of quarter restatement 
in  we terminated a number of our ten year derivative instruments in exchange for derivative instruments with shorter durations at above market terms 
the decrease in the fair value between the terminated ten year instrument and the new shorter term instrument was recognized as a non cash loss in fair value from restructured derivatives 
unrealized mark to market gains for is due to our recognition of million for unrealized gains on commodity derivatives that were not designated as hedges at inception 
these instruments were subsequently designated as hedges in august with unrealized gains and losses from that date forward recognized as a component of aoci 
these unrealized gains were partially offset by a decrease in fair value of the related hedge assets due to credit risk of our counterparties as of december  
table of contents other revenue years ended december  in thousands midstream revenue from third parties kgs canada texas total midstream revenue other total us midstream revenue declined in primarily as a result of the sale of our interests in kgs in october and a decrease in volumes gathered in our hcds which contributed to the impairment more fully discussed elsewhere in these results of operations 
the increase in canada was primarily the result of additional customers under contract for the transportation of natural gas

on a per mcfe basis the barnett shale asset lease operating expense increased due to production decreases during the year 
other us lease operating costs were impacted on a gross and unit basis by increased production and costs for our niobrara asset 
in canada  lease operating expense for decreased compared to due to lower well and compressor repair and maintenance costs and lower labor costs incurred during lease operating expense for in the us increased compared to primarily due to higher production volumes in our barnett shale asset  including costs attributable to new producing wells such as gas lift  chemicals and overhead of approximately million 
in addition  non variable costs such as compressor overhauls  repairs and replacements  environmental compliance and other costs increased by approximately million 
notably  saltwater disposal costs increased only slightly despite a increase in water volumes due to a higher percentage being piped and disposed of in our own disposal wells at a lower cost 

table of contents in our horseshoe canyon asset lease operating expense increased primarily due to increases in compression overhauls  utilities and surface costs 
notably  costs per mcfe in our horn river asset decreased as a consequence of increased production levels creating greater coverage of the fixed portion of expense

canadian gpt includes unused firm capacity of million and million for and  respectively 
the horn river asset decrease on a per mcfe basis is primarily attributable to increased production during gpt for compared to increased primarily due to the loss of fees earned by kgs for gathering and processing production from our barnett shale asset following the closing of the crestwood transaction and the increase in our barnett shale asset production 
kgs revenue  net of associated operating expenses  was million  or per mcfe  for the remainder of the increase is attributable to increases in production although unit costs were lower in excluding kgs effects because more production came from the northern portion of the basin 
canadian gpt increased for as compared to both in total dollars and on a per mcfe basis primarily as a result of higher gathering fees and increased production from our horn river asset for and the recognition of million for unutilized capacity under the company s firm transportation agreements with third parties 
the decrease in our horseshoe canyon asset is primarily due to reduced transportation fees and a decrease in production volumes 
our horseshoe canyon asset gpt also decreased due to reduced operating costs on gathering lines which feature cost sharing arrangements

the decrease in canadian production taxes from to is primarily the result of decreased volumes attributable to freehold acreage  which is subject to taxation  and due to decreased pricing upon which tax is levied 
the decrease in us ad valorem taxes as compared to is primarily the result of the sale of kgs  attributing million to the decrease 
the remaining approximately million decrease is attributable to reduced assessed property values as a function of lower prices 
the increase in canadian ad valorem taxes is due to increased rates on freehold lands and an increase in the midstream property base

table of contents us depletion expense for decreased from as production decreased in addition to a decreased depletion rate 
canadian depletion expense remained consistent due to increased production partially offset by a rate decrease 
both our us and canadian depletion rates have been impacted by the impairment charges recognized during we expect that our us and canadian depletion rate for will be approximately and per mcfe  respectively 
the decrease in us depreciation expense as compared to is the result of midstream impairments from the canadian depreciation expense increased in compared to as a result of additions of other fixed assets in support of our increased activity in the horn river asset 
us depletion for reflected an increase in the us depletion rate and an increase in us production when compared to the period 
the increase in the rate was due to a decrease in reserves and an increase in the depletion base associated with our capital program 
price deterioration adversely affected reserves in canadian depletion rate in was impacted by the impairment recognized in as the increase in proved reserves resulted in only a increase in the depletion base 
us depreciation decreased in from primarily as the result of including kgs depreciation of million and a million impairment of midstream assets 
canadian depreciation for reflects seven months of depreciation on our horn river asset midstream additions which were contributed in the formation of fortune creek 
impairment expense as required under gaap  we perform quarterly ceiling tests to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties 
we also assess our fixed assets reported outside the full cost pool when circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
information detailing the calculation of any impairment is more fully described in our critical accounting policies found below and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
in  we recognized non cash charges of billion and million for our us and canadian oil and gas properties  respectively  as a result of our quarterly ceiling tests 
the natural gas and natural gas liquids pricing used in our quarterly ceiling tests declined throughout the year resulting in impairment charges being recognized in each quarter 
additionally  effective december   we no longer account for derivatives as hedges and therefore our year end ceiling test did not include this benefit 
in performing our quarterly ceiling tests  we utilize the average first of month prices for the preceding months 
we do not anticipate additional impairment related to our oil and gas properties in as natural gas prices in are forecasted to be improved compared to we recognized impairment expense on other property and equipment of million  including million on pipelines and processing facilities located in colorado and texas as a result of reduced utilization and lower reserves 
we also impaired general properties million related to reduced utilization of a compressed natural gas station in texas 
we recognized a million non cash charge for impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties in the aeco natural gas price used to prepare the march  estimate of the ceiling limit for our canadian full cost pool decreased approximately from the aeco price used at december  when we also recognized an impairment charge for our canadian oil and gas properties 
our canadian ceiling test prepared at june   september  and december  resulted in no additional impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
our us ceiling tests  prepared quarterly  resulted in no impairment of our us oil and gas properties in in  we recognized a million impairment for certain midstream assets in texas that we retained after the sale of kgs 
the primary factors for the impairment were our inability to attract third party customers to utilize the pipe and a decrease in reserves from our assets that utilize the laterals 
during  we discontinued our efforts to actively market the hcds assets and recognized additional impairment of hcds 
we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recorded million during to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value 
in  we recognized impairment expense of million 
as a result of the decision by our board of directors to approve a plan for disposal of our hcds  we conducted an impairment analysis of the hcds and recognized a million non cash charge for impairment 
we also recognized a non cash million charge for impairment of our canadian oil and gas properties 
our canadian full cost pool has undergone significant change associated with the cost of bringing our initial horn river asset wells online and associated field costs while the proved reserves recognized had been limited due to the lack of any substantial production history for the area 

table of contents general and administrative expense years ended december  in thousands  except per unit amounts per mcfe per mcfe per mcfe equity compensation audit and accounting fees strategic transactions litigation settlement other total general and administrative expense for was million lower than due to a decrease in litigation settlement expense and strategic transaction costs during the year 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in our audit fees incurred related to our audit and an increase in our equity compensation during the year due to accelerated stock compensation expense in connection with a previously announced executive retirement 
in  we recognized expense of million related to previously deferred filing fees for our barnett shale asset master limited partnership since the transaction has been dormant since june the recognition of these fees in does not preclude us from continuing the offering process 
we expect our audit fees to return to more typical levels in general and administrative costs for the period included million for litigation settlement and million for legal  accounting and professional fees incurred in connection with the evaluation of possible strategic transactions 
general and administrative expense for the period included costs for the settlement of a separate legal matter for million  professional and legal fees incurred in connection with the crestwood transaction of million plus million of kgs general and administrative expense arising prior to the crestwood transaction 
gain on sale of kgs in october  we recognized a million gain upon closing of the crestwood transaction 
further information regarding the transaction can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
crestwood earn out in february  we collected million of earn out payments from crestwood 
we will not receive any additional payment in income from earnings of bbep we recorded our portion of bbep s earnings during the quarter in which its financial statements became publicly available 
as a result  our and annual results of operations included bbep s earnings for the months ended september  and  respectively 
we reduced our ownership of bbep units in and eliminated our remaining ownership position in as of december   we no longer owned any bbep units 
we recognized an million loss and income of million for equity earnings from our investment in bbep based upon its reported earnings for the month periods ended september  and  respectively 
during the time we owned bbep units  bbep experienced significant volatility in its net earnings primarily due to changes in the value of its derivative instruments for which it did not employ hedge accounting 
other income we recognized gains of million in from the sale of million bbep units 
we also recognized a gain of million from the conveyance of million bbep units as consideration in the acquisition of additional working interests in our lake arlington asset in may gains totaling million were recognized in september and october from the sale of million bbep units

liquidity and borrowing capacity in august  in light of then prevailing prices for natural gas and ngls  we amended our combined credit agreements primarily to relax the financial covenants contained therein through the second quarter of the next semi annual redetermination of our global borrowing base was scheduled to be completed in october however  in conjunction with the amendments to our combined credit agreements  our global borrowing base was also redetermined and the next redetermination is scheduled for april we expect a reduction in the borrowing base from million to approximately million 
as of february  we had approximately million outstanding under our combined credit agreements  including letters of credit 
while we believe that the remaining availability of approximately million together with operating cash flow will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the remainder of  the borrowing base may be reduced below million during the april or autumn redetermination or that amount may be insufficient to meet our liquidity needs 
highlights contains additional information about the changes to our debt 
our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants in our combined credit agreements may be affected by events beyond our control 
while we believe that we will be able to comply with these covenants through the end of  we do not expect to exceed the required levels by a significant margin 
accordingly  even a modest decline in prices for natural gas and ngls  our failure to achieve anticipated cost savings or the inaccuracy in any material respect of any of the other assumptions underlying our forecast could cause us to fail to comply with the covenants contained in the combined credit agreements 
in addition  absent an improvement in natural gas and ngl prices  significant deleveraging from a strategic transaction  reduced interest costs on our debt through refinancing or significant reductions to our operating costs  we expect to need to seek additional covenant relief under the combined credit agreements for any future inability to comply with these covenants  unless waived or amended by the requisite lenders  could materially and adversely affect our liquidity by rendering us unable to borrow further under our credit facilities and by accelerating the maturity of our debt 
we have an incurrence test under our indentures that requires ebitda to exceed interest expense by times 
at december   we did not meet this test and  as a result  we are limited in our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  except for specific baskets 
we do retain  however  the ability to utilize the full borrowing capacity under our combined credit agreements and our ability to refinance existing debt 
not meeting this ratio does not represent an event of default in our indentures 
we are presently unable to predict when or if we will meet the incurrence test 
additional information about our debt and related covenants is more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 

table of contents we anticipate that our capital program will be substantially funded by cash flow from operations and could be further supplemented by proceeds from asset sales  although we could also borrow under the combined credit agreements 
if our capital resources are insufficient to fund our capital expenditure plan  we will need to reduce our capital expenditures or seek other financing alternatives 
we may not be able to obtain financing needed in the future on terms that would be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we limit or defer our capital expenditure plan  we could adversely affect the recoverability and ultimate value of our oil and gas properties 
we are currently pursuing joint venture partners in our barnett shale asset and horn river asset 
any joint venture is likely to result in cash proceeds to us  a reduction in our capital expenditure and liquidity requirements or both 
depending upon conditions in the capital markets and other factors  we will from time to time consider the issuance of debt or other securities or other possible capital markets transactions  the proceeds of which could be used to refinance current indebtedness or for other corporate purposes 
we will also consider from time to time additional acquisitions of  and investments in  assets or businesses that complement our existing asset portfolio 
acquisition transactions  if any  are expected to be financed through cash flow from operations  borrowings under the combined credit agreements  proceeds from asset sales  the issuance of debt or other securities or a combination of those sources 
to manage our exposure to commodity prices and to provide a level of certainty in the cash flows that will support our capital expenditure program  we hedge a portion of our production and  as of february   we had hedged approximately mmcf per day of our estimated march through december natural gas production at a weighted average floor or swap price of per mcf

the valuation of our current and non current derivative assets and liabilities was million lower on a net basis at december  as compared to december  the decrease was primarily the result of million in settlements received partially offset by deferred unrealized gains of million recognized in oci 
long term debt increased million from net borrowings under our combined credit agreements including exchange rate impacts 
our net deferred income tax position changed from a net liability position of million to both the us and canada incurred losses in resulting in our deferred tax positions becoming a net deferred tax asset

in order to deliver gas that meets ngtl s specifications  we  through fortune creek  will construct a treatment facility for our gas 
under the amended pea  we agreed to provide financial assurances to cover ngtl s after tax costs for the komie north project  estimated to be c million  which is estimated to occur in stages based on ngtl s forecast of the komie north project costs  in the following cumulative amounts ngtl cumulative financial assurances c in thousands us in thousands april  july  september  a letter of credit for c million is outstanding for the komie north project as of december  which was reduced to c million during march the pea also requires that we execute firm transportation agreements for delivery of a minimum volume of gas of approximately mmcfd  increasing to mmcfd  over a ten year term commencing with the in service date of the komie north project 
the pea may be terminated prior to completion of the komie north project for various reasons  including the failure to obtain neb approval upon terms and conditions satisfactory to ngtl 
based upon our current agreement with ngtl  which we expect may be amended as a result of the report of the neb recommending against approval of the komie north project  we must pay actual costs incurred or paid by ngtl  or for which ngtl is liable  as of the termination date except in certain limited situations 
if we do not amend the agreement and if termination occurs  we would pay those costs plus c million with the option to purchase the project for an additional commitment letter agreement in april  we entered into a commitment letter agreement the commitment letter with ngtl 
under the commitment letter  we agreed to deliver gas to ngtl beginning upon commissioning one of its pipelines 
the obligation terminates on the earlier of ngtl s recovery of project costs or upon delivery of tcf cumulatively from us and any third party producers 
if neither has occurred by the end of the term of the transportation agreements  we will be required to renew the contract on an annual basis for a minimum volume of mmcfd until either the cost recovery or volume delivery requirements have been met 
the commitment letter terminates if the pea terminates for any reason other than the completion of the komie north project 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expense and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
management believes that the following accounting estimates are the most critical in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and they require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with our audit committee 

table of contents oil and gas reserves policy description proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
we use an unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices for determination of proved reserve values included in calculating full cost ceiling limitations and for annual proved reserve disclosures 
we assume continued use of technologies with demonstrated success of yielding expected results  including the use of drilling results  well performance  well logs  seismic data  geological maps  well stimulation techniques  well test data and reservoir simulation modeling 
operating costs are the period end operating costs at the time of the reserve estimate and are held constant into future periods 
our estimates of proved reserves are determined and reassessed at least annually using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
revisions may result from changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
we recognize pud reserves beyond one offset location where reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances 
in our barnett shale asset  we had proved undeveloped gas well locations at december   including locations that are more than one offset 
additional information regarding our proved oil and gas reserves may be found under oil and natural gas reserves found in item of this annual report 
judgments and assumptions all of the reserve data in this annual report are based on estimates 
estimates of our oil  natural gas and ngl reserves are prepared in accordance with guidelines established by the sec 
reservoir engineering is a subjective process of estimating recoverable underground accumulations of oil  natural gas and ngls 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating recoverable quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
uncertainties include the projection of future production rates and the expected timing of development expenditures 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of oil  natural gas and ngls that are ultimately recovered 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
the weighted average annual revisions to our reserve estimates over the last four years have been less than of the weighted average previous year s estimate excluding revisions due to price changes 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in ceiling test related impairments 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling limitation  estimation of proved reserves is also a significant component of the calculation of depletion expense 
for example  if estimates of proved reserves decline  the depletion rate will increase  resulting in a decrease in net income 
full cost ceiling calculations policy description we use the full cost method to account for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  all costs associated with the acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized and accumulated in cost centers on a country by country basis 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to development and exploration activities  but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is calculated and recognized 
the application of the full cost method generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher depletion rates compared to its alternative  the successful efforts method 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs for each cost center is depleted on the equivalent unit of production basis using proved oil and gas reserves 
excluded from amounts subject to depletion are costs associated with unevaluated properties 
under the full cost method  net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost reduced by the related net deferred tax liability and asset retirement obligations or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of estimated future net revenue  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on the unweighted average of the preceding month first day of the month prices adjusted to reflect local differentials and contract provisions  unescalated year end costs and derivatives that are accounted for as hedges which are included in our oil and gas revenue  the cost of properties not being amortized  the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax bases of the oil and gas properties 
if the 
table of contents net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability and asset retirement obligations exceeds the cost center ceiling limitation  a non cash impairment charge is required 
judgments and assumptions the discounted present value of future net cash flows from our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is the major component of the ceiling calculation  and is determined in connection with the estimation of our proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of reserve estimation requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of natural gas  ngl and oil reserves  and the applicable discount rate that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the current sec rule requires the use of the future net cash flows from proved reserves discounted at 
therefore  the future net cash flows associated with the proved reserves is not based on our assessment of future prices or costs 
in calculating the ceiling  we adjust the future net cash flows by the discounted value of derivative contracts in place that hedge future prices 
this valuation is determined by calculating the difference between reserve pricing and the contract prices for such hedges also discounted at 
at december   no derivatives were included in the ceiling 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that our historical experience be held constant indefinitely and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves or the oil and gas properties 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
at any time that we conduct a ceiling test  forecasted prices can be either substantially higher or lower than our historical experience 
also  marginal borrowing rates may be well below the required used in the calculation 
rates below  if they could be utilized  would have the effect of increasing the otherwise calculated ceiling amount 
therefore  oil and gas property ceiling test related impairments that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
derivative instruments policy description we enter into derivatives to mitigate risk associated with the prices received from our natural gas  ngl and oil production 
we may also utilize derivatives to hedge the risk associated with interest rates on our outstanding debt 
all derivatives are recognized as either an asset or liability on the balance sheet measured at their fair value determined by reference to published future market prices and interest rates 
to designate a derivative as a cash flow hedge  we document at the hedge s inception our assessment that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting expected changes in cash flows from the item hedged 
this assessment  which is updated at least quarterly  includes performing regression analysis and is generally based on the most recent relevant historical correlation between the derivative and the item hedged 
if  during the derivative s term  we determine the hedge is no longer highly effective  hedge accounting is prospectively discontinued and any remaining unrealized gains or losses  based on the effective portion of the derivative at that date  are reclassified to earnings as revenue or interest expense when the underlying transaction occurs 
for derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of gains and losses are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in revenue or interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
gains or losses on derivatives terminated prior to their original expiration date are deferred and recognized as earnings during the period covered by the hedge 
if the hedged transaction is no longer probable  the deferred gain or loss would be immediately recorded to earnings 
changes in value of ineffective portions of hedges  if any  are recognized currently as a component of derivative gains losses  net 
for derivatives that qualify as fair value hedges  such as interest rate swaps  the gains or losses are recognized currently in earnings  while the gains or losses on the hedged items adjust the carrying value of the hedged items and are recognized currently in earnings 
any gains or losses on the derivatives not offset by the gains or losses on the hedged items are recognized as the value of ineffectiveness in the hedge relationships 
for derivatives that are not designated at their inception  we record an asset or liability for each instrument and recognize changes in fair value in earnings as a component of derivative gains losses  net 
effective december   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting on all existing hedge contracts 
net deferred hedge gains deferred in aoci associated with these contracts as of december  will be reclassified to earnings during the same periods in which the hedged transactions are recognized in our earnings 
in the future we will recognize changes in the fair values of derivative contracts as gains or losses in the earnings of the periods in which they occur 

table of contents we enter into derivatives with counterparties who are our lenders at the inception of the derivative 
all versions of our credit facility provide for collateralization of amounts outstanding from our derivatives in addition to amounts outstanding under the facility 
additionally  default on any of our obligations under derivatives with counterparty lenders could result in acceleration of the amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
our credit facility and our internal credit policies require that any counterparties  including facility lenders  with whom we enter into commodity derivatives have credit ratings that meet or exceed bbb or baa from standard and poor s or moody s  respectively 
the fair value for each derivative takes credit risk into consideration  whether it be our counterparties or our own 
derivatives are classified as current or non current derivative assets and liabilities  based on the expected timing of settlements 
judgments and assumptions the estimates of the fair values of our commodity and interest rate derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
valuations are based upon multiple factors such as futures prices  volatility data from major oil and gas trading points  length of time to maturity  credit risks and interest rates 
we compare our estimates of fair value for these instruments with valuations obtained from independent third parties and counterparty valuation confirmations 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results 
future changes to forecasted or realized commodity prices could result in significantly different values and realized cash flows for such instruments 
stock based compensation policy description an estimate of fair value is determined for all share based payment awards 
recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards is recognized over the vesting period for each award 
judgments and assumptions estimating the grant date fair value of our stock based compensation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the grant date fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions that we use to determine stock based compensation expense 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to changes in stock based compensation expense that could be material 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used  the stock based compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the stock based compensation 
income taxes policy description deferred income taxes are established for all temporary differences between the book and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
in addition  deferred tax balances must be adjusted to reflect tax rates that we expect will be in effect during years in which we expect the temporary differences will reverse 
canadian taxes are computed at rates in effect or expected to be in effect in canada 
us deferred tax liabilities are not recognized on profits that are expected to be permanently reinvested in canada and thus are not considered available for distribution to us 
net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets are reviewed annually for recoverability  and if necessary  are recorded net of a valuation allowance 
judgments and assumptions we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we believe our deferred tax assets are not more likely than not to be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in making that assessment  we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis to determine  based on the weight of available evidence  whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
examples of positive and negative evidence include historical taxable income or losses  forecasted income or losses  the estimated timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences as well as prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
we consider a cumulative loss in recent years as a significant piece of negative evidence 
a valuation allowance  by taxing jurisdiction  is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not expected to be realized 
significant management judgment is also required in determining the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions 
we consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
our income tax provision would increase or decrease in the period in which the assessment is changed

effective december   we discontinued the use of hedge accounting 
the net deferred hedge gain that is included in aoci as of december  will be released into revenue from natural gas  ngl and oil production during the periods in which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings 
subsequent to december   we will account for the derivative instruments utilizing the mark to market accounting method  whereby we recognize the changes in the fair values of our derivative contracts as gains or losses in the earnings of the period in which they occur

table of contents the fair value of all derivative instruments included in these disclosures was estimated using prices quoted in markets for the periods covered by the derivatives and the value confirmed by counterparties and does not include an adjustment for counterparty credit risk 
estimates were determined by applying the net differential between the prices in each derivative and market prices for future periods to the amounts stipulated in each contract to arrive at an estimated future value 
this estimated future value was discounted on each contract at rates commensurate with federal treasury instruments with similar contractual lives 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates affect the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our combined credit agreements 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes have fixed interest rates and thus do not expose us to risk from fluctuations in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
in  we executed early settlements of our interest rate swaps that were designated as fair value hedges of our senior notes due and our senior subordinated notes 
we deferred gains of million as a fair value adjustment to our debt  which we began to recognize over the life of the associated debt instruments 
for  and  interest expense was reduced million  million and million  respectively  because of our interest rate swaps 
should we be required to borrow under our combined credit agreements  and based on interest rates as of december   each million in borrowings would result in additional annual interest payments of million 
if the current borrowing availability under our combined credit agreements were to be fully utilized by year end at interest rates as of december   we estimate that annual interest payments would increase by million 
if interest rates change by on our december  variable debt balances of million  our annual pre tax income would decrease or increase by million 
in the future  we may enter into interest rate derivative contracts on a portion of our outstanding debt to mitigate the risk of fluctuation of rates or manage the floating versus fixed rate risk 
foreign currency risk our canadian subsidiary uses the canadian dollar as its functional currency 
to the extent that business transactions in canada are not denominated in canadian dollars  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
non functional currency transactions resulted in a gain of million  included in net earnings for and losses of million  and million  respectively  included in net earnings for and furthermore  the amended and restated canadian credit facility permits canadian borrowings to be made in either us or canadian denominated amounts 
however  the aggregate borrowing capacity of the entire facility is calculated using the us dollar equivalent 
accordingly  there is a risk that exchange rate movements could impact our available borrowing capacity
