the company million of total cash at december   is primarily cash held at various banking institutions 
approximately million is held in cash accounts at international bank institutions and the remaining million is primarily held in non interest bearing accounts at various domestic banks 
in july  president obama signed into law the dodd frank act  which again led to changes in fdic deposit guarantees 
beginning january  and lasting through december   all funds held in noninterest bearing transaction accounts at insured depository institutions were automatically fully insured  without limit 
this temporary unlimited insurance expired at the end of and has reverted to a  limit per bank 
on october   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and bank of america  na for an unsecured line of credit of up to million  which includes a million letter of credit subfacility  and a million swingline subfacility 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit or under the swingline subfacility 
the company maintains approximately million in letters of credit 
these letters of credit are required by the company fronting insurance companies and or certain states  due to the company self insured status  to secure various workers compensation and casualty insurance contracts coverage 
the company believes that it has adequate liquid assets  funding sources and insurance accruals to accommodate such claims 

table of contents the revolving credit agreement is guaranteed by certain of rollins domestic subsidiaries 
the maturity date of the credit agreement is october   subject to optional annual extensions on the first three anniversaries of the credit agreement for one year each 
revolving loans under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at one of the following two rates  at the company election the base rate  which shall mean the highest of i the per annum rate which the administrative agent publicly announces from time to time as its prime lending rate  ii the federal funds rate  plus per annum  and iii the adjusted libor rate which equals libor as increased to account for the maximum reserve percentages established by the us federal reserve determined on a daily basis for an interest period of one  plus per annum

the revolving credit agreement contains customary terms and conditions  including  without limitation  certain financial covenants including covenants restricting the company ability to incur certain indebtedness or liens  or to merge or consolidate with or sell substantially all of its assets to another entity 
further  the revolving credit agreement contains financial covenants restricting the company ability to permit the ratio of the company consolidated debt to ebitda to exceed certain limits 
the company remained in compliance with applicable debt covenants at december  and expects to maintain compliance throughout litigation for discussion on the company legal contingencies  see note to the accompanying financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments other than the operating leases disclosed in the table that follows  the company has no material off balance sheet arrangements 
the impact that the company contractual obligations as of december  are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years business combination related liabilities non cancelable operating leases unrecognized tax positions total these amounts represent expected payments with interest for unrecognized tax benefits as of december  uncertain tax positions of million are not included due to the uncertainty of the final amount and settlement 
minimum pension funding requirements are not included as funding will not be required 
the company is considering making contributions to its pension plans of approximately million during 
table of contents critical accounting policies the company views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite claims representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repairs and associated labor and chemicals  settlements  awards and other costs relative to termite control services 
factors that may impact future cost include termiticide life expectancy and government regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company business practices 
however  it is not possible to precisely predict future significant claims 
accruals for termite contracts are included in other current liabilities and long term accrued liabilities on the company consolidated statements of financial position 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on a semi annual basis to provide the company an estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
management judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
the company continues to be proactive in risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs to reduce claims 
initiatives that have been implemented include pre employment screening and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature on a monthly  bi monthly or quarterly basis  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized based on the delivery of the individual units of accounting 
at the inception of a new baiting services contract upon quality control review of the installation  the company recognizes revenue for the installation of the monitoring stations  initial directed liquid termiticide treatment and servicing of the monitoring stations 
a portion of the contract amount is deferred for the undelivered monitoring element 
this portion is recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
the allocation of the purchase price to the two deliverables is based on the relative selling price 
there are no contingencies related to the delivery of additional items or meeting 
table of contents other specified performance conditions 
baiting renewal revenue is deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
at inception revenue received for conventional termite renewals is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  and  the cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals are expensed as incurred 
for outstanding claims  an estimate is made of the costs to be incurred including legal costs based upon current factors and historical information 
the performance of reinspections tends to be close to the contract renewal date and while reapplications and repairs involve an insubstantial number of the contracts  these costs are incurred over the contract term 
as the revenue is being deferred  the future cost of reinspections  reapplications and repairs and associated labor and chemicals applicable to the deferred revenue are expensed as incurred 
the company accrues for noticed claims 
the costs of providing termite services upon renewal are compared to the expected revenue to be received and a provision is made for any expected losses 
all revenues are reported net of sales taxes 
contingency accruals the company is a party to legal proceedings with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  management estimates and accrues for its liability and costs associated with the litigation 
estimates and accruals are determined in consultation with outside counsel 
because it is not possible to accurately predict the ultimate result of the litigation  judgments concerning accruals for liabilities and costs associated with litigation are inherently uncertain and actual liabilities may vary from amounts estimated or accrued 
however  in the opinion of management  the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse impact on the company financial condition or results of operations 
contingency accruals are included in other current liabilities and long term accrued liabilities on the company consolidated statements of financial position 
defined benefit pension plans in  the company ceased all future benefit accruals under the rollins  inc defined benefit plan  although the company remains obligated to provide employees benefits earned through june the company terminated the waltham services  llc salaried pension plan and all benefits have been settled via an annuity purchase or lump sum in december the company also includes the waltham services  llc hourly employee pension plan to the company financial statements 
the company accounts for these defined benefit plans in accordance with fasb asc topic compensation retirement benefits  and engages an outside actuary to calculate its obligations and costs 
with the assistance of the actuary  the company evaluates the significant assumptions used on a periodic basis including the estimated future return on plan assets  the discount rate  and other factors  and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company chooses an expected rate of return on plan assets based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes  the investments strategy  and the views of our investment adviser 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over future years 
therefore  the net deferral of past asset gains losses ultimately affects future pension expense 
the company assumption for the expected return on plan assets is which is unchanged from the prior year 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company utilizes a yield curve approach 
the approach utilizes an economic model whereby the company expected benefit payments over the life of the plans is forecasted and then compared to a portfolio of corporate bonds that will mature at the same time that the benefit payments are due in any given year 
the economic model then calculates the one discount rate to apply to all benefit payments over the life of the plan which will result in the same total lump sum as the payments from the corporate bonds 
the discount rate was as of december  compared to in and in a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligation 

table of contents as set forth in note to the company financial statements  included among the asset categories for the plan investments are real estate  tactical composite and alternative investments comprised of investments in real estate and hedge funds 
these investments are categorized as level investments and are valued using significant non observable inputs which do not have a readily determinable fair value 
in accordance with asu no 
investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent  these investments are valued based on the net asset value per share calculated by the funds in which the plan has invested 
these valuations are subject to judgments and assumptions of the funds which may prove to be incorrect  resulting in risks of incorrect valuation of these investments 
the company seeks to mitigate against these risks by evaluating the appropriateness of the funds judgments and assumptions by reviewing the financial data included in the funds financial statements for reasonableness 
as of december   the defined benefit plans were under funded and the recorded change within accumulated other comprehensive income decreased stockholders equity by million before tax and million after tax 
new accounting standards recently issued accounting standards to be adopted in in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update asu disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities asu to topic  balance sheet 
the update requires new disclosures about balance sheet offsetting and related arrangements 
for derivatives and financial assets and liabilities  the amendments require disclosure of gross asset and liability amounts  amounts offset on the balance sheet  and amounts subject to the offsetting requirements but not offset on the balance sheet 
the guidance is effective december  and is to be applied retrospectively 
this guidance does not amend the existing guidance on when it is appropriate to offset  as a result  we do not expect this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued asu no 
 testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
this standard provides new accounting guidance that permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
an entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment  while no further analysis would be required if it passes 
the provisions of the new guidance are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  we do not expect the new guidance to have an impact on the impairment test results 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu to topic  comprehensive income 
the guidance which requires disclosure of significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component and their corresponding effect on the respective line items of net income 
this guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of  we do not expect the new guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements 
forward looking statements this annual report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements include statements regarding the company belief that its levels of supplies will alleviate the potential short term shortage in availability from its suppliers  management belief that environmental remediation costs estimated to be incurred are not material to the company financial condition or operating results  the outcome of litigation  as discussed in the legal proceedings section and elsewhere  and the company belief that such litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the company expectation to continue its payment of cash dividends  the adequacy of the

the actual results of the company could differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements because of various risks  timing and uncertainties including  without limitation  the possibility of an adverse ruling against the company in pending litigation  general economic conditions  market risk  changes in industry practices or technologies  the degree of success of the company termite process reforms and pest control selling and treatment methods  the company ability to identify potential acquisitions  climate and weather trends  competitive factors and pricing practices  potential increases in labor costs  and changes in various government laws and regulations  including environmental regulations 
all of the foregoing risks and uncertainties are beyond the ability of the company to control  and in many cases the company cannot predict the risks and uncertainties that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements
