the following discussion includes forward looking statements 
for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ from results discussed in the forward looking statements  see forward looking statements and certain considerations contained in the introduction to this report 
overview we operate the largest chemical bulk tank truck network in north america and are also the largest provider of intermodal iso tank container and depot services in north america 
in  we began providing logistics services to the unconventional oil and gas frac shale energy markets 
we operate an asset light business model and service customers across north america through our network of terminals servicing the chemical markets  iso tank depot services terminals intermodal servicing the chemical and other bulk liquid markets and terminals servicing the energy markets 
chemical logistics through our subsidiary  qci  we coordinate the transport of a broad range of chemical products and provide our customers with logistics and other value added services 
through our north american network  we are a core carrier for many of the major companies engaged in chemical processing 
we believe the diversity of our customer base  geography and end markets provide a competitive advantage 
the bulk tank truck market in north america includes all products shipped by bulk tank truck carriers and consists mainly of liquid and dry bulk chemicals including plastics and bulk dry and liquid food grade products 
we estimate  based on industry sources  that the highly fragmented north american for hire segment of the bulk tank transport market generated revenues of approximately billion in we specifically operate in the for hire chemical and food grade bulk transport market which we estimated at billion in 
we believe we have the leading market share estimated at in in this sector based on revenues 
we believe managing a larger carrier network facilitates customer service and lane density  and provides a more favorable operating cost structure for us and our independent affiliates 
as such  we believe we are well positioned to expand our business 
chemical bulk tank truck industry growth is generally dependent on volume growth in the industrial chemical industry  the rate at which chemical companies outsource their transportation needs  the overall capacity of the rail system  and  in particular  the extent to which chemical companies make use of the rail system for their bulk chemical transportation needs 
we also believe that north american chemical producers will gain a global competitive advantage and grow domestic production thus shipments which we can service through the use of low cost energy sources  primarily natural gas and natural gas liquids 
the chemical bulk tank truck industry is characterized by high barriers to entry such as the time and cost required to develop the operational infrastructure necessary to handle sensitive chemical cargo  the financial and managerial resources required to recruit and train drivers  substantial and increasingly more stringent industry regulatory requirements  strong customer relationships and the significant capital investments required to build a fleet of equipment and establish a network of terminals and independent affiliates 
our transportation revenue in the chemical logistics segment is principally a function of the volume of shipments by the bulk chemical industry  prices  the average number of miles driven per load  our market share and the allocation of shipments between tank truck transportation and other modes of transportation such as rail 
additionally  it is common practice in the bulk tank truck industry for customers to pay fuel surcharges 
energy logistics our energy logistics business began operations in the second quarter of primarily as a third party logistics pl provider 
we operate the business through our subsidiary  qcer 
our energy logistics business services the unconventional oil and gas frac shale energy market through the transportation of crude oil  fresh water  flowback and produced brine water  and the disposal of flowback and produced brine water  as well as providing services ancillary to these activities 
during  we expanded our energy logistics business through the following acquisitions on april   we acquired certain operating assets of trojan vacuum services  which operates in the eagle ford shale 
we paid million in cash at closing  plus million in cash in january upon the satisfaction of certain operating and financial performance criteria 
on june   we acquired certain operating assets of wiley bice trucking  llc and certain operating assets and rights of rm resources  llc  collectively bice  which operates in the bakken shale region  for million in aggregate consideration  with up to an additional million in cash consideration payable one year after the closing date if certain future operating and financial performance criteria are satisfied 
on august   we acquired certain operating assets of dunn s tank services  inc and its related company nassau disposal  inc  collectively dunn s  which operates in the marcellus  woodford and utica shale regions for an aggregate purchase price of million  with up to an additional million in cash consideration payable one year after the closing date if certain future operating and financial performance criteria are satisfied 

table of contents as of december   we operate in the bakken  eagle ford  permian  marcellus  woodford  utica and mississippian limestone shale regions in north america  all of which drill for both oil and natural gas with the exception of marcellus  which is solely natural gas 
we continue to evaluate the potential for expansion into additional shales  which would provide additional diversification to our business 
our strategy to target multiple resource rich shales helps to diversify our customer offerings  lessen the impact of swings in any one commodity and optimize equipment utilization 
we currently operate approximately  units tractors  trailers and combination equipment of energy equipment in this market across a diverse customer base 
our energy logistics business is primarily involved in fluid management and logistics in the upstream segment of the energy industry  through its services in connection with the establishment of production wells  and the midstream segment of the energy industry  in connection with the transportation of crude oil 
we believe the market for services such as those provided by our energy logistics business was approximately to billion in the industry is made up of providers that include independent national or regional trucking and logistics companies such as qcer  trucking and logistics companies owned by or dedicated to large oil and gas companies  and local providers focused on one or more particular shales 
energy logistics providers are impacted by the level of new drilling activity  which impact the transportation of fresh water and flowback water used and the provision of related services used in those activities  and the number of active wells  which impacts the transportation of crude oil and produced water and the provision of related services used in those activities 
the energy logistics market is also impacted by market prices for oil and gas  which influence the production activities of our customers  the prices they are willing to pay for our services  and the shales in which they operate 
we expect regulation of this industry to increase over time but believe that the scope of our operations and our experience with regulation in our chemical logistics business will facilitate our adaptation to new regulations and may provide us with an advantage over some of our competitors 
intermodal our subsidiary  boasso  provides intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services  through terminals located in the eastern half of the united states 
in the fourth quarter of  boasso expanded its operations through the acquisition of greensville transport company  which operates at a port located in norfolk  virginia 
boasso s revenues are impacted by united states chemical import export volume  in particular the number and volume of shipments through ports at which boasso has terminals  as well as their market share at those ports 
in addition to intermodal tank transportation services  boasso provides tank cleaning  heating  testing  maintenance and storage services to customers 
boasso provides local and over the road trucking primarily within the proximity of the port cities where its depots are located 
chemical manufacturers have sought to efficiently transport their products on a global basis by utilizing iso tank containers  and we believe the resulting demand for distributors that can offer a broad range of services within the supply chain will drive future growth in this sector 
we believe that our intermodal business will benefit from these trends because of its market leadership  experience and track record 
the intermodal iso tank container business generally provides services that facilitate the global movement of liquid and dry bulk chemicals  pharmaceuticals and food grade products 
the proliferation of global import export of bulk liquid chemicals has driven the movement of basic manufacturing out of the united states and has resulted in an increase in chemical plant infrastructure to service these off shore industries 
driven by this globalization  the intermodal iso tank container market is a growing sector of the overall liquid bulk chemical transportation sector 
demand for intermodal iso tank containers is impacted by the aggregate volume of imports and exports of chemicals through united states ports 
demand is also impacted by the shift in modes of transportation  from drums to iso tank containers 
economic conditions and differences among the laws and currencies of foreign nations may also impact the volume of shipments 
we operate in the global intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services market  which we believe was approximately a to billion market in our networks our businesses have networks that consist of terminals owned or operated by independent affiliates and terminals owned or operated by us and a driver pool consisting of independent owner operator drivers  affiliate employed drivers and company employed drivers 
independent affiliates are independent companies with which we contract to operate trucking terminals and provide transportation services exclusively on our behalf in defined markets 
the independent affiliates generally provide the capital necessary 
table of contents to service their contracted business and are also responsible for most of the operating costs associated with servicing the contracted business 
due to several factors  including our ownership of the customer contracts and relationships  our provision of back office support in areas such as claims  our direct relationship with independent owner operators  the presence of non compete agreements with the independent affiliates  and  in some cases  our ownership of the trailers utilized in the contracted business  our relationships with the independent affiliates tend to be long term in nature  with minimal voluntary turnover 
independent owner operators are generally individual drivers who own or lease their tractors and agree to provide transportation services to us under contract 
we believe our use of independent affiliates and independent owner operators provides us with the following benefits locally owned and operated independent affiliate terminals can provide superior  tailored customer service 
independent affiliates and independent owner operators generally are paid a fixed  contractual percentage of revenue collected on each load they transport creating a variable cost structure that mitigates against cyclical downturns 
reliance on independent affiliates and independent owner operators creates an asset light business model that generally reduces our capital investment 
at present  our businesses rely upon independent affiliates and independent owner operators to varying degrees 
our chemical logistics business operates primarily through independent affiliate terminals located throughout the continental united states and independent owner operator drivers 
our intermodal business relies primarily on company terminals located near ports in the eastern half of the united states and independent owner operator drivers 
our energy logistics business currently relies primarily upon company terminals  which will affect the overall mix of our asset light business  located near shale regions that have historically experienced frac shale drilling for natural gas and oil and independent owner operator drivers  however  it also operates through independent affiliate terminals in certain shale regions 
we expect to continue to add independent affiliates and owner operators with the goal to reduce the capital burden of this business while improving return on invested capital 
the following table shows the approximate number of terminals  drivers  tractors  trailers  energy logistics equipment and chemical logistics transportation billed miles that we manage including independent affiliates and independent owner operators as of december terminals drivers tractors trailers energy logistics equipment chemical logistics transportation billed miles in thousands refer to item properties for terminals by segment includes approximately and drivers for the energy logistics business as of december  and  respectively 
includes tractors  trailers and combination equipment

certain affiliates of apollo management  lp also sold million shares in the offering 
pursuant to the offering  we used our net cash proceeds to redeem million of our senior subordinated pik notes due pik notes at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest on march  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we believe the following are the more critical accounting policies that impact the financial statements  some of which are based on management s best estimates available at the time of preparation 
actual future experience may differ from these estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment expenditures  including tractor and trailer rebuilds that extend the useful lives of such equipment  are capitalized and recorded at cost 
for financial statement purposes  these assets are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets to an estimated salvage value 
the asset lives used are presented in the following table average lives in years buildings and improvements tractors and terminal equipment trailers energy logistics equipment disposal wells furniture and fixtures other equipment building improvements are recorded at the shorter of the lease term or useful life 
tractor and trailer rebuilds  which are recurring in nature and extend the lives of the related assets  are capitalized and depreciated over the period of extension  generally to years  based on the type and extent of these rebuilds 
maintenance and repairs are charged directly to expense as incurred 
management estimates the useful lives of these assets based on historical trends and the age of the assets when placed in service 
any changes in the actual lives could result in material changes in the net book value of these assets 
additionally  we estimate the salvage values of these assets based on historical sales or disposals  and any changes in the actual salvage values could also affect the net book value of these assets 
furthermore  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in the business climate indicate that the expected undiscounted future cash flows from the related asset may be less than previously anticipated 
if the net book value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  the carrying amount would be reduced to the present value of its expected future cash flows and an impairment loss would be recognized 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions in projecting future cash flows  and changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes in the amount of any write offs for impairment 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually during the second quarter with a measurement date of june  and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by determining the fair value for each reporting unit to which our goodwill relates 
at december   our energy logistics  intermodal and chemical logistics segments contain goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with past and recent acquisitions 
the methodology applied in the analysis performed at june  was consistent with the methodology applied in prior years  but was based on updated assumptions  as appropriate 
as a result of our analysis  we concluded no impairment had occurred as of june   and we continued to evaluate indicators of impairment quarterly following our annual goodwill impairment test at june  through december  there were no indications that a triggering event has occurred 
as of december   we had total goodwill of million  of which million was allocated to our energy logistics segment  million was allocated to our intermodal segment and million was allocated to our chemical logistics segment 
as of december   we had total intangibles of million  of which million was allocated to our energy logistics segment  million was allocated to our intermodal segment and million was allocated to our chemical logistics segment 
goodwill under the fasb guidance  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill involves a two step process and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in the first step  we determine whether there is an indication of impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if  based on the first step  we determine that there is an indication of goodwill impairment  we assess the impairment in step two in accordance with the fasb guidance 
in the first step  we determine the fair value for each reporting unit using a combination of two valuation approaches the market approach and the income approach 
the market approach uses a guideline company methodology which is based upon a comparison of each reporting unit to similar publicly traded companies within our industry 
we derive a market value of invested capital or business enterprise value for each comparable company by multiplying the price per share of common stock of the publicly traded companies by their total common shares outstanding and adding each company s current level of debt 
we calculate a business enterprise multiple based on revenue and earnings from each company  then apply those multiples to each reporting unit s revenue and earnings to conclude a reporting unit business enterprise value 
assumptions regarding the selection of comparable companies are made based on  among other factors  capital structure  operating environment and industry 
as the comparable companies were typically larger and more diversified than our reporting units  multiples were adjusted prior to application to our reporting units revenues and earnings to reflect differences in margins  long term growth prospects and market capitalization 
the income approach uses a discounted debt free cash flow analysis to measure fair value by estimating the present value of future economic benefits 
to perform the discounted debt free cash flow analysis  we develop a pro forma analysis of each reporting unit to estimate future available debt free cash flow and discounting estimated debt free cash flow by an estimated industry weighted average cost of capital based on the same comparable companies used in the market approach 
per the fasb guidance  the weighted average cost of capital is based on inputs eg  capital structure  risk  etc 
from a market participant s perspective and not necessarily from the reporting unit or qdi s perspective 
future cash flow is projected based on assumptions for our economic growth  industry expansion  future operations and the discount rate  all of which require significant judgments by management 
after computing a separate business enterprise value under the income approach and market approach  we apply a weighting to them to derive the business enterprise value of the reporting unit 
the income approach and market approach were both weighted in the analysis performed at june  the weightings are evaluated each time a goodwill impairment assessment is performed and give consideration to the relative reliability of each approach at that time 
given that the business enterprise value derived from the market approach supported what was calculated in the income approach  we believed that both approaches should be equally weighted 
based on these weightings  we calculated a business enterprise value for the reporting unit 
we then add debt free liabilities of the reporting unit to the calculated business enterprise value to derive an implied fair value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value is then compared to the reporting unit s carrying value 
upon completion of the analysis in step one  we determined that the fair value of both our energy logistics and intermodal reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value 
as such  a step two analysis was not required 

table of contents intangible assets to determine the implied fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we utilize the relief from royalty method  pursuant to which those assets are valued by reference to the amount of royalty income they would generate if licensed in an arm s length transaction 
under the relief from royalty method  similar to the discounted cash flow method  estimated net revenues expected to be generated by the asset during its life are multiplied by a benchmark royalty rate and then discounted by the estimated weighted average cost of capital associated with the asset 
the resulting capitalized royalty stream is an indication of the value of owning the asset 
based upon management s review of the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets in our intermodal segment  we determined that the implied fair value exceeded its carrying value 
if there are changes to the methods used to allocate carrying values  if management s estimates of future operating results change  if there are changes in the identified reporting units or if there are changes to other significant assumptions  the estimated carrying values for each reporting unit and the estimated fair value of our goodwill could change significantly  and could result in future impairment charges  which could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred tax asset in accordance with fasb guidance  we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and  in particular  any valuation allowance that is recorded or released against our deferred tax assets 
we continue to evaluate quarterly the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these deferred tax assets 
we review a rolling thirty six month calculation of us earnings  and consider other criteria at each reporting date  to determine if we have incurred cumulative income or losses in recent years 
in addition  we review future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  the ability to carry back tax attributes to prior years  feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
during  we recorded a deferred tax benefit of million of which related to a prior year valuation allowance release 
these releases of the valuation allowance are a result of our consistent cumulative income position  improved operating results  and recent expansion of our energy business through acquisition 
our assessment of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets primarily relied on the positive evidence related to our cumulative income position as of december  we have determined that it is more likely than not that expected future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize substantially all of our us federal and state net deferred tax assets 
we will continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset related to foreign tax credits to the extent sufficient positive evidence does not exist to support their utilization 
changes in deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are reflected in the provision for income taxes line in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had an estimated million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  million of unrecognized federal operating loss carryforwards related to excess stock compensation deductions and uncertain tax position deductions  million in alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million in foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire in the years through  while the alternative minimum tax credits may be carried forward indefinitely and the foreign tax credits will expire in years through uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb guidance  we account for uncertainty in income taxes  using a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we re evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition and measurement would result in recognition of a tax benefit and or an additional charge to the tax provision 
environmental liabilities we have reserved for potential environmental liabilities based on the best estimates of potential clean up and remediation for known environmental sites 
we employ a staff of environmental professionals to administer all phases of our environmental programs and use outside experts where needed 
these professionals develop estimates of potential liabilities at these sites based on projected and known remediation costs 
these cost projections are determined through previous experiences with other sites and through bids from third party contractors 
management believes current reserves are reasonable based on current information  but estimates of environmental reserves and exposures may be affected by information subsequently received 

table of contents accrued loss and damage claims we currently maintain liability insurance for bodily injury and property damage claims  covering all employees  independent owner operators and independent affiliates  and workers compensation insurance coverage on our employees and company drivers 
this insurance includes deductibles up to million per incident for bodily injury and property damage and up to million for workers compensation 
as such  we are subject to liability as a self insurer to the extent of these deductibles under various policies 
we are self insured for damage to the equipment we own or lease and for cargo losses 
as of december   we had million in an outstanding letter of credit to our insurance company to guarantee the self insurance portion of our liability 
if we fail to meet certain terms of our agreement  the insurance company may draw down the letter of credit 
in developing liability reserves  we rely on insurance company estimates  the judgment of our own licensed claims adjusters  and independent professional actuaries and attorneys 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trends in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management believes reserves are reasonable given known information  but as each case develops  estimates may change to reflect the effect of new information 
revenue recognition transportation revenue  including fuel surcharges and related costs  is recognized on the date freight is delivered 
service revenue consists primarily of rental revenues primarily tractor and trailer rental  intermodal and depot revenues  disposal well services revenues  tank wash revenues and insurance related administrative services 
rental revenues from independent affiliates  independent owner operators and third parties are recognized ratably over the lease period 
intermodal and depot revenues  consisting primarily of repair and storage services  are recognized when the services are rendered 
disposal well services revenues are recognized when the services are rendered 
insurance related administrative service revenues are recorded ratably over the service period 
we recognize all revenues on a gross basis as the principal and primary obligor with risk of loss in relation to our responsibility for completion of services as contracted with our customers 

table of contents allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for all potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
these factors are continuously monitored by our management to arrive at the estimate for the amount of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to independent owner operators and independent affiliates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
stock compensation plans stock compensation is determined by the assumptions required under the fasb guidance 
the fair values of stock option grants are based upon the black scholes option pricing model and amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
restricted stock awards are issued and measured at market value on the date of grant and related compensation expense is recognized over time on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the unvested portion of our stock based awards 
the recognition period for the remaining unrecognized stock based compensation cost generally varies from two to four years 
for further discussion on stock based compensation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
pension plans we maintain two noncontributory defined benefit plans resulting from a prior acquisition that cover certain vested salaried participants and retirees and certain other vested participants and retirees under an expired collective bargaining agreement 
both plans are frozen and  as such  no future benefits accrue 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates to and assumed rates of return to depending on the pension plan 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plans and other factors 
we had an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million at december  and an accumulated net pension equity charge after tax of million at december  the discount rate is based on a model portfolio of aa rated bonds with a maturity matched to the estimated payouts of future pension benefits 
the expected return on plan assets is based on our expectation of the long term rates of return on each asset class based on the current asset mix of the funds  considering the historical returns earned on the type of assets in the funds  plus an assumption of future inflation 
the current inflation assumption is 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
the effects of the modifications are amortized over future periods 
assumed discount rates and expected return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension plan

our projected net periodic pension expense is million 
a decrease in our assumed discount rate would increase our pbo to million and decrease our net periodic pension expense less than million 
a increase in our assumed discount rate would decrease our pbo to million and increase our net periodic pension expense less than million

restructuring we account for restructuring costs associated with one time termination benefits  costs associated with lease and contract terminations and other related exit activities in accordance with the fasb s guidance 
we previously made estimates of the 
table of contents costs to be incurred as part of a restructuring plan developed during and concluded at the end of the restructuring plan consisted of various actions including termination of approximately non driver positions  the consolidation  closure or affiliation of underperforming company terminals  our withdrawal from three multi employer pension plans and costs associated with the consolidation of our corporate headquarters and resulted in charges during  and  primarily related to our chemical logistics segment 
as of december   approximately million was accrued related to the restructuring charges  which are expected to be paid through new accounting pronouncements refer to note  summary of significant accounting policies new accounting pronouncements for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and for additional discussion surrounding the adoption of accounting standards

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  comparability for the year ended december  to the year ended december  is affected by recent acquisitions consummated in the fourth quarter of and during in november  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of greensville  which is included in our intermodal segment 
in april  we acquired certain operating assets of trojan 
in june  we acquired certain operating assets and rights of bice  and in august  we acquired operating assets of dunn s 
trojan  bice and dunn s are collectively referred to as the energy acquisitions and are included in our energy logistics segment 
for the year ended december   total revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million for the same period in transportation revenue increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in energy logistics revenue of million  of which million related to the energy acquisitions and million related to our existing energy business which began in the second quarter of in addition  we had an increase of million in our intermodal business due to an increase in demand and revenue related to greensville 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in chemical logistics revenue of million due to driver capacity constraints resulting from the installation of eobrs  partially offset by price increases 
service revenue increased million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in our energy logistics business of million  of which million was due to the energy acquisitions and million related to our existing energy business 
in addition  we had higher intermodal depot services revenue of million and higher chemical logistics revenue of million 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in our intermodal business and a slight increase in fuel prices 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our chemical logistics and intermodal customers 
most of these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the changes in fuel prices 
as a result  some of these programs have a short time lag between when fuel prices change and when this change is reflected in revenues 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel expense  or the change in fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs are included in purchased transportation 

table of contents purchased transportation increased million  or  due to an increase of million in costs related to servicing the energy logistics market  of which million was due to the energy acquisitions and million in costs related to servicing our existing energy business 
purchased transportation also increased million related to our intermodal business  offset by a decrease of million in costs related to servicing the chemical logistics market 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in our independent affiliates generated of our chemical logistics revenue and fuel surcharge revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the comparable prior year period 
this decrease resulted from the conversion of five independent affiliate trucking terminals to company operated terminals and the addition of one new company operated terminal 
during the and periods  we paid our independent affiliates approximately of chemical logistics transportation revenue and paid independent owner operators approximately of chemical logistics transportation revenue 
during the year ended december   hauling for the energy market was performed by company operated terminals  independent affiliates and independent third party carriers 
during this period  company operated terminals generated approximately of the energy revenue and independent affiliates and third party carriers generated approximately 
we typically pay these independent contractors between and of transportation revenue depending on their type of association with the company

compensation expense in our chemical logistics business increased million due to an increase in company terminals 
fuel  supplies and maintenance increased million  or  due primarily to an increase of million related to our energy logistics business of which million was due to the energy acquisitions 
we had an increase of million related to our chemical logistics business resulting from an increase in fuel costs of million  an increase in equipment rent expense of million and an increase in other terminal costs of million  primarily at our company operated terminals 
in addition  we had an increase of million related to our intermodal business due to an increase in fuel costs of million  an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of million and an increase in equipment rent of million 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in depreciation for new energy logistics equipment and an increase in amortization expense for acquired intangible assets 
we expect our depreciation and amortization expense to be higher in than as energy logistics equipment and intangible assets acquired during are depreciated and amortized  respectively  for a full twelve months 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in our chemical logistics business of million which includes the incurrence of million of acquisition related costs  an increase of million in professional fees  which includes million for various legal settlements  a lease termination cost of million  an increase in building rent of million and other terminal costs of million 
in addition  our energy logistics business had increased costs of million  of which million is due to the energy acquisitions  and our intermodal business had increased costs of million 
insurance costs increased million  or  due to an increase in volume in our energy logistics business  additional premiums related to the energy acquisitions and settlement of a large claim 
as a percentage of revenue  insurance expense was below the low end of the company s target range of to of total revenue 
we recognized a gain on disposal of revenue equipment of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the second quarter of  we recognized a restructuring credit of million resulting from the reduction of a liability for the withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan which was fully paid in the second quarter of in  we had no restructuring credit 
for the year ended december   operating income was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating income of million for the same period in the operating margin for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in as a result of the above mentioned items 
operating income was negatively impacted by million of operating costs and reduced profitability related to the transition of operations of an independent affiliate during the third and fourth quarters of 
table of contents interest expense increased million  or  in the year ended december   primarily due to an increase in our weighted average abl facility borrowings which were primarily used to fund the energy acquisitions 
we expect our interest expense for to be higher than the comparable period of due to higher average debt balances 
we had no write offs of debt issuance costs during the year ended december  in the year ended december   we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs and other bank fees of which million resulted from the redemptions of our remaining pik notes in january  march and july and million related to the refinancing of our previous abl facility 
other income of million in consists primarily of the net adjustments of acquisition earnout provisions related to the acquisitions of greensville  trojan and dunn s 
other expense in consists primarily of foreign currency expense of million 
we recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared to a provision for income taxes of million for the same period in the effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted by a release of million in the aggregate of our deferred tax valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate in the same period in was impacted by a valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   net income was million compared to net income of million for the same period in as a result of the above mentioned items 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for were million  an increase of million  or  from revenues of million in transportation revenue increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase in new energy logistics revenue of million generated primarily from our delivery of fresh and disposal water in the frac shale energy market  most of which was generated in the second half of the year  and an increase of million in our intermodal business 
this was partially offset by a decrease in chemical logistics revenue of million due to a decrease in bulk chemical shipments 
in  our chemical logistics business was adversely affected by a high level of driver turnover primarily driven by our installation of eobrs in our fleet 
we installed eobrs in all of our us fleet in order to improve efficiency and proactively address regulatory requirements that we expect in the future 
service revenue increased million  or 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in intermodal revenue of million and other revenue of million  partially offset by a decrease in trailer rental revenue of million 
trailer rental revenue declined in connection with the implementation of eobrs in our fleet 
fuel surcharge revenue increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in fuel prices 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our chemical logistics and intermodal customers 
these programs typically involve a specified computation based on the changes in fuel prices

it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel expense  or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs are included in purchased transportation 
purchased transportation increased million  or  due to an increase of million in costs related to servicing the chemical logistics market resulting from a shift in mix from independent owner operators to independent affiliates  a million increase for costs related to servicing the energy logistics market  and a million increase for costs related to our intermodal business 
total purchased transportation as a percentage of transportation revenue and fuel surcharge revenue increased slightly to for versus for our independent affiliates generated of our chemical logistics revenue and fuel surcharge revenue for compared to for during the and periods  we paid our independent affiliates approximately of chemical logistics transportation revenue and paid independent owner operators approximately of chemical logistics transportation revenue 
during  hauling for the energy market was performed by independent affiliates and other independent third party carriers 
in the energy market  we typically pay between to of the transportation revenue depending upon whether the independent affiliate or a third party carrier does the hauling  which generated nearly of our energy logistics revenue in compensation expense increased by million  or  due to an increase in our chemical logistics business of million primarily due to an increase in health care claims  an increase in our intermodal business of million  of which million relates to greensville following its acquisition and an increase of million in our energy logistics business 

table of contents fuel  supplies and maintenance decreased million  or  due to a decrease of million related to our chemical logistics business primarily due to lower repairs and maintenance expense of million and lower equipment rent of million  partially offset by an increase in fuel costs of million from company operated operations 
lower repairs and maintenance resulted from aggressive reduction of aged or underutilized specialty equipment in the decrease was partially offset by increased costs of million related to our intermodal business due to an increase in repairs and maintenance expense of million from higher revenues  increased fuel costs of million and costs of the operations of greensville following its acquisition of million 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  primarily due to a decrease in depreciation due to sales of revenue equipment offset by an increase in depreciation for new energy equipment 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  primarily due to an increase in our chemical logistics segment of million  which was comprised primarily of increased environmental expense and professional fees of million  and an increase in company operated terminal costs of million mostly associated with our implementation of eobrs  partially offset by a decrease in building rent expense of million 
in addition  our intermodal business had increased costs of million due to increased demand and we had increased costs of million in our energy logistics business 
insurance costs decreased by million  or  due to a premium refund received of million related to prior policy years and a reduction in the number and severity of claims in the amount of million was identified as a prior period error which was corrected and recorded during the fourth quarter of we concluded that this adjustment was not material to our interim and annual consolidated financial statements for or the financial statements for any prior period based on our consideration of quantitative and qualitative factors 
communication and utilities expense decreased million  or  primarily due to cost savings initiatives 
we recognized a gain on disposal of revenue equipment of million in  as compared to a loss on disposal of assets of million in from the sale and disposal of equipment 
in  we recognized a restructuring credit of million resulting from a reduction of a liability for the withdrawal from a multi employer pension plan which was fully paid in the second quarter of in  we incurred restructuring costs of million resulting from a restructuring plan which began in and concluded in the costs in consisted primarily of million for an estimated withdrawal liability from three multi employer pension plans  million for the consolidation of our corporate headquarters  as well as an additional million of other expenses related to exit activities 
operating income was million in  an increase of million  or  compared to operating income of million in the operating margin for was compared to for as a result of the above mentioned items 
interest expense decreased by million  or in  primarily due to redemptions of our high cost pik notes in and and lower interest rates on our notes following our debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of in  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs and other bank fees  of which million resulted from the redemptions of our remaining pik notes in january  march and july and million related to the refinancing of our previous abl facility 
in  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs resulting from the redemption and repurchase of our pik notes in december other expense of million in consists primarily of foreign currency expense of million 
other expense of million in consists primarily of costs associated with an unconsummated stock offering of million 

table of contents the provision for income taxes was million in compared to million in the effective rate for was  which is lower than our anticipated effective tax rate in large part due to an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
net income was million for compared to a net loss of million for as a result of the above mentioned items 
segment operating results we have three reportable business segments for financial reporting purposes that are distinguished primarily on the basis of services offered chemical logistics  which consists of the transportation of bulk chemicals primarily through our network of independent affiliates and company operated terminals  and equipment rental income  energy logistics  which consists primarily of the transportation of fresh water  disposal water  and crude oil for the unconventional oil and gas frac shale energy markets  primarily through company operated terminals and independent affiliates  and intermodal  which consists of boasso s intermodal iso tank container transportation and depot services business primarily supporting the international movement of bulk liquids 
segment operating income reported in our segment tables excludes amounts such as depreciation and amortization  gains and losses on disposal of property and equipment  restructuring costs  corporate and other unallocated amounts 
although these amounts are excluded from the business segment results  they are included in our reported consolidated statements of operations 
most corporate and shared services overhead costs  including acquisition costs  are included in our chemical logistics segment

the decline was driven by reduced linehaul revenue resulting primarily from lower shipment volumes and the lingering effects of the implementation of electronic on board recorders on driver counts 
although driver counts are rising slightly  industry wide tightness in driver capacity could adversely impact our chemical logistics business for a portion of this decline was partially offset by an increase of million of fuel surcharge revenue due to increased fuel prices and an increase of million primarily due to increased trailer rental revenue 
energy logistics revenues increased million  or more than  for the year ended december  due to our entry into the unconventional oil and gas frac shale energy market during the second quarter of  the energy acquisitions and growth of our existing energy business through the addition of two independent affiliates 
intermodal revenues increased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  due to the greensville acquisition  continued strong demand for iso container shipments  and increases in brokerage  storage and repair business

exchange rates we operate primarily in the united states but also have operations in canada and mexico 
our results of operations are affected by the relative strength of currencies in the countries where we operate 
approximately  and of our revenue in  and  respectively  was generated outside the united states 
in comparing the average exchange rates between and  the canadian dollar and the mexican peso depreciated against the united states dollar by approximately 
the change in exchange rates negatively impacted revenue by approximately million in the depreciation of the canadian dollar was the primary reason for the less than million net increase in cumulative currency translation loss in shareholders deficit for gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of operations from foreign currency transactions included a less than million gain in  a million loss in  and a million gain in risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations are discussed further in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and capital resources our primary cash needs consist of debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and share repurchases 
our working capital needs depend upon the timing of our collections from customers and payments to others  as well as our capital and operating lease payment obligations 
our capital expenditures primarily relate to acquiring trailers to maintain the chemical logistics fleet and supporting our energy logistics business with growth capital 
we reduce our capital expenditure requirements for our chemical logistics business by utilizing independent affiliates and independent owner operators 
independent affiliates and independent owner operators typically supply their own tractors  which reduces our capital investment requirements 
for  capital expenditures were million and proceeds from sales of property and equipment were 
table of contents million 
we generally expect our sustaining capital expenditures  net of proceeds from property and equipment sales  to be approximately to of operating segment revenues annually 
we expect net capital expenditures to be approximately to million for the year 
notwithstanding our general expectation for sustaining capital expenditures  we expect net capital expenditures in to be lower than in  regardless of operating revenue  as we focus on equipment rationalization 
some of our independent affiliates who are engaged with us in the chemical logistics or energy logistics markets may at times purchase some portion of this equipment from us 
actual amounts could differ materially because of operating needs  growth needs  regulatory changes  covenants in our debt arrangements  other expenses or other factors 
debt service currently consists of required interest payments on the outstanding balance of our abl facility and our outstanding notes as well as acquisition related indebtedness 
we have no major debt maturities prior to august  when our abl facility matures 
during  note indebtedness was comprised primarily of our notes and our pik notes  though the aggregate principal balance of notes changed during we redeemed million of our pik notes in january we redeemed million of our pik notes with the proceeds from our common stock offering in march and redeemed the remaining million of our pik notes in july we may from time to time repurchase or redeem additional amounts of our outstanding debt or may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock 
our board of directors has approved a share repurchase program for up to million in shares of our common stock  of which million remained available at december  any repurchases or redemptions would depend upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors we consider important 
future repurchases or redemptions may materially impact our liquidity  future tax liability and results of operations 
our primary sources of liquidity for operations during the and periods have been cash flow from operations and borrowing availability under the abl facility and our previous abl facility 
at december   we had million of borrowing availability under the abl facility 
we periodically make business acquisitions with cash as part or all of the consideration 
some acquisitions provide us with new assets to pledge under our abl facility and increase our borrowing capacity 
further  we increased our maximum borrowing capacity under the abl facility by amendment on september  if availability under the abl facility is insufficient to fund future acquisitions or pay contingent consideration on previous acquisitions  we would either need to raise additional capital or use other sources of liquidity to consummate the desired transactions or meet those requirements 
we believe that  based on current operations and anticipated growth  our cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of liquidity  will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  operating expenses and our other anticipated liquidity needs for the next months 
anticipated debt maturities in  the acquisition of other businesses or other events that we do not foresee may require us to seek alternative financing  such as restructuring or refinancing our long term debt  selling assets or operations or selling additional debt or equity securities 
if these alternatives were not available in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms or were not permitted under any of our debt agreements and we default on our obligations  our debt could be accelerated and our assets might not be sufficient to repay in full all of our obligations

we are amortizing these costs over the term of the debt instruments 
the abl facility our abl facility provides for a revolving credit facility with a maturity of august  on september   our maximum borrowing capacity under the facility was increased from million to million 
borrowing availability under our abl facility did not change as a result of this amendment 
changes in borrowing availability result from increases or decreases in assets securing the abl facility 
the abl facility includes borrowing capacity of up to million for letters of credit and up to million for swingline borrowings on same day notice 
the abl facility is available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
at december   we had million of borrowing availability under the abl facility 
borrowings under the abl facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus  at our option  either a base rate or libor 
the applicable margin at december  was for base rate borrowings and for libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for borrowings will be reduced or increased based on aggregate borrowing base availability under the abl facility and may be further reduced in the event that our fixed charge coverage ratio as calculated under the abl facility exceeds a target level 
the base rate is equal to the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds overnight rate plus and day libor plus 
in addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the abl facility  we are required to pay an unutilized commitment fee to the lenders quarterly at a rate ranging from to  depending on the average utilization of the abl facility 
we also pay customary letter of credit fees quarterly 
we may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the abl facility at any time without premium or penalty  other than customary breakage costs with respect to libor loans 
the interest rate on the abl facility at december  and was and  respectively 
the borrowing base for the abl facility consists of eligible accounts receivable  inventory  tractor and trailer equipment  real property and certain other equipment 
we recorded million in debt issuance costs relating to the abl facility 
we are amortizing the debt issuance costs over the remaining term of the abl facility 
the previous abl facility our abl facility replaced our previous abl facility on august  our previous abl facility consisted of a current asset tranche in the amount of million and a fixed asset tranche in the amount of million 
the previous abl facility included a sublimit of up to million to issue letters of credit and was available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
the interest rate under the current asset tranche was based  at our option  on either the administrative agent s base rate plus or on the eurodollar libor rate plus an applicable margin 
the administrative agent s base rate was equal to the greater of the federal funds overnight rate plus or the prime rate 
the interest rate under the fixed asset tranche was based  at our option  on either the administrative agent s base rate plus or on libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin under either tranche was subject to increases or reductions based upon the amounts available for borrowing 
accounting treatment for the exchange of abl facility for previous abl facility and amendment of abl facility the exchange of our previous abl facility for the abl facility was treated partially as a debt modification and partially as a debt extinguishment in accordance with fasb guidance 
under applicable fasb guidance  we compared the product of the remaining term multiplied by the maximum borrowing capacity of our previous abl facility to the maximum borrowing capacity of the new arrangement on a creditor by creditor basis to determine the accounting treatment 
for each creditor  if the borrowing capacity of the new arrangement is greater than or equal to the maximum borrowing capacity of the old arrangement  then the exchange is classified as a modification  and  if not  the exchange is classified as an extinguishment in proportion to the percentage of the decrease 
if the exchange is classified as a modification  then any unamortized debt issuance costs relating to our previous abl facility are allocated to the abl facility and amortized over the term of the abl facility using the effective interest method 
furthermore  if the exchange is classified as an extinguishment  then any unamortized debt issuance costs relating to our previous abl facility are written off in proportion to the decrease in maximum borrowing capacity of the abl facility 
upon the exchange of 
table of contents our previous abl facility with the abl facility  we wrote off million of unamortized debt issuance costs  reflecting the proportion of such costs determined to be for indebtedness treated as extinguished  and the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs of million  relating to indebtedness deemed a modification  were allocated to the abl facility 
the recent amendment to the abl facility was treated as a modification 
second priority senior secured notes due on november   we issued million aggregate principal amount of the notes

the remaining million of outstanding letters of credit as of december  relates to various other obligations 
in conjunction with acquisitions completed in  we recorded liabilities for potential contingent consideration of approximately million 
at december   we have million remaining of liabilities for potential contingent consideration 
these liabilities represent our preliminary estimates which are subject to change based upon these acquired businesses meeting certain future operating and financial performance criteria 
at this time  based on certain assumptions  we expect this potential contingent consideration to be paid during and expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these obligations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risks from i interest rates due to our variable interest rate indebtedness  ii foreign currency fluctuations due to our international operations and iii increased commodity prices due to the diesel consumption necessary for our operations 
during the last three years  we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in other hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to such risks 
interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes through our variable rate borrowings under the abl facility 
with regard to the abl facility  at qd llc s option  the applicable margin for borrowings at december  was with respect to base rate borrowings and with respect to libor borrowings 
the applicable margin for such borrowings will be reduced or increased based on aggregate borrowing base availability under the abl facility and may be further reduced in the event that our fixed charge coverage ratio as calculated under the abl facility exceeds a target level 
the base rate under the abl facility is equal to the highest of the prime rate  the federal funds overnight rate plus  and day libor plus 
balance at december  interest rate at december  effect of increase in s in s abl facility at december   a point increase in the current per annum interest rate would result in million of additional interest expense during the next months 
the foregoing calculation assumes an instantaneous point increase in the rates under the abl facility and that the principal amount is the amount outstanding as of december  the calculation therefore does not account for the differences in the market rates upon which the interest rates of our indebtedness are based  our option to elect the lowest of three different interest rates under our borrowings or other possible actions  such as prepayment  that we might take in response to any rate increase 
foreign currency exchange rate risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
the currencies in each of the countries in which we operate affect the results of our international operations reported in united states dollars  and the value of the net assets of our international operations reported in united states dollars 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations canada and mexico represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and of our consolidated revenue in the economic impact of foreign exchange rate movements is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
therefore  to isolate the effect of changes in currency does not accurately portray the effect of these other important economic factors 
as foreign exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
while we may hedge specific transaction risks  we generally do not hedge translation risks because we believe there is no long term economic benefit in doing so 
assets and liabilities for our canadian operations are matched in the local currency  which reduces the need for dollar conversion 
our mexican operations use the united states dollar as their functional currency 
any foreign currency impact on translating assets and liabilities into dollars is included as a component of shareholders deficit 
our revenue results for were negatively impacted by a million foreign currency movement  primarily due to the weakening of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profits for related to the canadian dollar versus the united states dollar 
we estimate that a adverse change in the canadian dollar foreign exchange rate would have decreased our revenues by approximately million in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
our inter company loans are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates primarily between the united states dollar and the canadian dollar 
based on the outstanding balance of our intercompany loans at december   a change of in the exchange rate for the canadian dollar would cause a change in our foreign exchange result of less than million 

table of contents commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  global politics and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the price and availability of diesel fuel can be unpredictable as well as the extent to which fuel surcharges can be collected to offset such increases 
in and  a majority of fuel costs were covered through fuel surcharges
