overview we are engaged in the discovery  development  and delivery of a new generation of vaccines and immune therapies  called synthetic vaccines  focused on cancers and infectious diseases 
our dna based syncon technology enables the design of universal vaccines capable of providing cross protection against new  unmatched strains of pathogens such as influenza 
our electroporation dna delivery technology uses brief  controlled electrical pulses to increase cellular dna vaccine uptake 
initial human data has shown this method can safely and significantly increase gene expression and immune responses 
our clinical programs include hpv cervical cancer therapeutic  avian influenza preventive  prostate cancer therapeutic  leukemia therapeutic  hcv and hiv vaccines 
we are advancing preclinical research for a universal seasonal pandemic influenza vaccine as well as other products 
our partners and collaborators include university of pennsylvania  drexel university  national microbiology laboratory of the public health agency of canada  program for appropriate technology in health malaria vaccine initiative path or mvi  national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid  merck  chrontech  university of southampton  united states military hiv research program usmhrp  us army medical research institute of infectious diseases usamriid  hiv vaccines trial network hvtn and department of homeland security dhs 
all of our potential human products are in research and development phases 
we have not generated any revenues from the sale of any such products  and we do not expect to generate any such revenues for at least the next several years 
we earn revenue from license fees and milestone revenue  collaborative research and development agreements  grants and government contracts 
our product candidates will require significant additional research and development efforts  including extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
all product candidates that we advance to clinical testing will require regulatory approval prior to commercial use  and will require significant costs for commercialization 
we may not be successful in our research and development efforts  and we may never generate sufficient product revenue to be profitable 
recent developments on december   we completed an underwritten public offering relating to the sale and issuance of  units to certain institutional investors  consisting of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of up to  additional shares of common stock 
these units include the partial exercise of the underwriter s overallotment option of  additional units at the public offering price 
the units consist of one share of common stock and of a warrant to purchase one share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants have a term of five years and an exercise price of per share

critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s judgment 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the year ended december  other than the adoption of recent accounting pronouncements discussed below 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition 
grant revenue we receive non refundable grants under available government programs 
government grants towards current expenditures are recorded as revenue when there is reasonable assurance that we have complied with all conditions necessary to receive the grants  collectability is reasonably assured  and as the expenditures are incurred 
license fee and milestone revenue we have adopted a strategy of co developing or licensing our gene delivery technology for specific genes or specific medical indications 
accordingly  we have entered into collaborative research and development agreements and have received funding for pre clinical research and clinical trials 
prior to the adoption of the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  we analyzed our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the identified deliverables could be accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
the delivered item s were considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria were met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if these criteria were not met  the deliverable was combined with other deliverables in the arrangement and accounted for as a combined unit of accounting 
for new collaborative agreements or material modifications of existing collaborative agreements entered into after december   we follow the provisions of asu no 
in order to account for the multiple element arrangements  we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separable units of accounting 
analyzing the arrangement to identify deliverables requires the use of judgment  and each deliverable may be an obligation to deliver services  a right or license to use an asset  or another performance obligation 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the collaborator on a standalone basis based on the consideration of the relevant facts and circumstances for each arrangement 
arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the agreement to all identified units of accounting based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence of selling price exists  we use our best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the amount of allocable arrangement consideration is limited to amounts that are fixed or determinable 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered and undelivered elements can impact revenue recognition but do not change the total revenue recognized under any agreement 
upfront license fee payments are recognized upon delivery of the license if facts and circumstances dictate that the license has standalone value from the undelivered items  the relative selling price allocation of the license is equal to or exceeds 
table of contents the upfront license fee  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  our price to the collaborator is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
upfront license fee payments are deferred if facts and circumstances dictate that the license does not have standalone value 
the determination of the length of the period over which to defer revenue is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
prior to the adoption of asu no 
 revenue recognition topic milestone method of revenue recognition milestone method  we recognized non refundable milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones upon which we had earned the milestone payment  provided the milestone payment was substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
we deferred payments for milestone events that were reasonably assured and recognized them ratably over the minimum remaining period of our performance obligations 
payments for milestones that were not reasonably assured were treated as the culmination of a separate earnings process and were recognized as revenue when the milestones were achieved 
effective january   we adopted on a prospective basis the milestone method of asu no 
under the milestone method  we will recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is substantive in its entirety 
a milestone is considered substantive when it meets all of the following criteria the consideration is commensurate with either the entity performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity performance to achieve the milestone  the consideration relates solely to past performance  and the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
a milestone is defined as an event i that can only be achieved based in whole or in part on either the entity performance or on the occurrence of a specific outcome resulting from the entity performance  ii for which there is substantive uncertainty at the date the arrangement is entered into that the event will be achieved and iii that would result in additional payments being due to the company 
research and development expenses 
since our inception  most of our activities have consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our electroporation technologies and dna vaccines 
research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
valuation and impairment evaluations of goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
as of december   our intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of vgx and inovio as  and additional intangibles including previously capitalized patent costs and license costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
we are concurrently conducting pre clinical  phase i  and phase ii trials using acquired intangibles  and we have entered into certain significant licensing agreements for use of these acquired intangibles 
historically we have recorded patents at cost and amortized these costs using the straight line method over the expected useful lives of the patents or years  whichever is less 
patent costs consist of the consideration paid for patents and related legal costs 
effective june   in connection with our acquisition of vgx  all new patent costs are being expensed as incurred 
patent costs currently capitalized will continue to be amortized over the expected life of the patent 
the effect of this change was immaterial to prior periods 
we record license costs based on the fair value of consideration paid and amortize using the straight line method over the shorter of the expected useful life of the underlying patents or the term of the related license agreement 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses  market conditions and other factors 
if impairment is indicated  we reduce the carrying value of the intangible asset to fair value 
while our current and historical operating and cash flow losses are potential indicators of impairment  we believe the future cash flows to be received from our intangible assets will exceed the intangible assets carrying value  and accordingly  we have not recognized any impairment losses through december  
table of contents goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead are measured for impairment annually  or when events indicate that impairment exists 
our accounting policy with respect to reviewing goodwill for impairment is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value including allocated goodwill 
if the carrying value of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the impairment loss  if any 
we test goodwill for impairment at the entity level  which is considered our reporting unit 
our estimate of fair value is determined using both the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline public company method of the market approach 
the discounted cash flow method estimates future cash flows of our business for a certain discrete period and then discounts them to their present value 
the guideline public company method computes value indicators multiples from the operating data of the selected publicly traded guideline companies 
after these multiples were evaluated  appropriate value indicators were selected and applied to the operating statistics of the reporting unit to arrive at indications of value 
specifically  we relied upon the application of total invested capital based valuation multiples for each guideline company 
in applying the income and market approaches  premiums and discounts were determined and applied to estimate the fair values of the reporting unit 
to arrive at the indicated value of equity under each approach  we then assigned a relative weighting to the resulting values from each approach to determine whether the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  thus requiring step two of the impairment test 
we conduct the impairment test annually on november th for each fiscal year for which goodwill is evaluated for impairment 
we are also aware of the requirement to evaluate goodwill for impairment at other times should circumstances arise 
to date  we have concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded the carrying value and therefore  step two of the impairment test has never been performed 
although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process  the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets 
furthermore  we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
stock based compensation 
we have equity incentive plans under which we have granted incentive stock options  restricted stock units and non qualified stock options 
our employee stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value stock option awards 
we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
our non employee stock based compensation awards are measured at either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
if the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used  it is measured at each reporting date using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached  or ii the date at which the counterparty s performance is completed 
registered common stock warrants 
we account for registered common stock warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the registered warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify registered warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
we develop our estimates based on historical data 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the registered warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as change in fair value of common stock warrants 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report

general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include business development expenses and the amortization of intangible assets 
the million decrease in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a  decrease in severance expenses  a  decrease in employee stock based compensation due to no severance related stock option expense  and a  decrease in compensation and related expenses

the variance is primarily due to the revaluation of registered common stock warrants issued by us in january and december we revalue warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value 
gain loss from investment in affiliated entity the gain loss is a result of the change in the fair market value of the investment in vgx int l for the year ended december  gain on sale of assets the gain on sale of assets is related to the march asset purchase agreement with oncosec 
the gain is related to the cash received related to the sale as well as the initial fair value of the warrants received in connection with the first and second amendments to the asset purchase agreement signed in september and march  respectively see note

accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  with the exception of the valuation of our equity investment in vgx int l which is denominated in south korean won 
we do not have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place 
certain transactions related to us are denominated primarily in foreign currencies  including euros  british pounds  canadian dollars and south korean won 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets where we conduct business  including the impact of the existing crisis in the global financial markets in such countries and the impact on both the united states dollar and the noted foreign currencies 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we do not engage in exchange rate hedging or hold or issue foreign exchange contracts for trading purposes
