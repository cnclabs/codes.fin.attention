item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in those forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those described under item a 
risk factors 
the discussion on financial results below has been revised to reflect the corrections of immaterial errors in previously reported financial results 
see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for detailed discussion 
overview executive summary with an improving economy  our leasing revenue increased approximately from the level and we continued to keep our business right sized  allowing us to maintain a strong adjusted ebitda margin of during we have been cash flow positive for consecutive quarters and have used this positive cash flow to pay down debt of approximately million since june  our level of business started to improve on a year over year basis by the fourth quarter of  with signs of moderate economic recovery beginning in our leasing revenues and total revenues improved quarter over quarter in and  compared to the same period in the prior year 
we continued to enact selective price increases  focusing on both new and existing customers that had units out on rent for an extended period of time  and to date we have observed no measurable difference in the attrition rates for these customers 
we continue to optimize our hybrid sales model incorporating a local  as well as centralized component  with both groups incentivized on the basis of performance 
the sales personnel at our branches primarily focus on construction customers who tend to be large multi unit customers that benefit from local service  while those in our nsc in tempe  arizona target the balance of our customers  which includes single unit customers 
we also have a similar model in europe 
we monitor our business activity levels through a variety of metrics that we use to determine the optimal efficiencies for our drivers  dispatchers  managers  salespeople and corporate staff needed while continuing our focus on customer service and sales activity levels 
in  we converted a number our branches to operational yards by leveraging our branch management to cover more than one market  which allowed us to lower the cost structure of these locations 
as our business began to stabilize from the economic downturn in  we began entering additional markets through three greenfield operational yards where we redeployed existing fleet to these new locations 
with growth returning to our business in  we opened an additional ten greenfield locations and entered two additional locations in by acquiring market leaders through traditional acquisitions just prior to year end 
in  we entered four new markets through greenfield expansions  combined two branches in the uk into one location  converted two full service branches in the us into low cost operational yards and completed one acquisition which became part of an existing branch 
at december   we operated in locations throughout north america and europe and believe we can expand to more than new markets in north america 
we believe these continued growth efforts  together with managing working capital and controls over capital expenditures  will allow us to generate free cash flow in in  we reduced our debt by million  after payment of million in financing costs for the new credit agreement and redemption premiums on the senior notes due  and had million of unused borrowing capacity under our credit agreement as of december  our focus is on revenue growth at both our existing and new locations as we continue our sophisticated sales campaign strategies at our nsc and branches 
we intend to accomplish this in part through increasing sales personnel accountability through our disciplined sales processes  which we believe gives us a significant competitive advantage 
general we are the world s leading provider of portable storage solutions  through a total lease fleet of over  units at december  we operate in locations throughout north america and europe  maintaining a strong leadership position in virtually all markets served 
we offer a wide range of portable storage products in varying lengths and widths with an assortment of differentiated features such as our patented locking systems  premium doors  electrical wiring and shelving 
our portable storage units provide secure  accessible temporary storage for a diversified client base across various industries 

table of contents we derive approximately of our revenues from leasing our portable storage containers  security office units and mobile office units 
we also sell new and used portable storage containers  security office units and mobile office units 
in addition  we provide delivery  installation and other ancillary products and services to our customers 
our sales revenues represented of total revenues in on june   we acquired the outstanding shares of our largest competitor  msg  and msg became a wholly owned subsidiary of mobile mini 
we refer to this transaction as the merger or the msg acquisition throughout this annual report 
the msg acquisition was the largest acquisition we have completed and significantly expanded the number of our geographic locations in both the us and the us and also expanded our presence in a number of existing markets 
following the merger  we implemented our business model across the newly acquired msg branches 
this enabled us to close locations and combine branch management in overlapping markets as well as reposition our lease fleet to align with customer demand 
our consolidated statements of income for the periods reported include certain estimated expenses expected or incurred related to integration of the msg acquisition and restructuring charges related to restructuring of our manufacturing operations as a result of the msg acquisition 
prior to the acquisition of msg  we grew both organically and through smaller acquisitions  which we used to gain a presence in new markets 
traditionally  we enter new markets through the acquisition of smaller local competitors and then implement our business model  which is typically more focused on customer service and marketing than the acquired business or other market competitors 
given our current utilization levels  we are primarily entering new markets by migrating idle fleet to new low cost greenfield operational yards and occasionally by acquiring an existing business when the right economic conditions are present 
these greenfield operational yards do not have all the overhead associated with a fully staffed branch as they typically only have a sales representative  drivers and yard personnel to handle deliveries and pick ups of our fleet 
a new location will generally have fairly low operating margins during its early years  but as we penetrate the new market through our marketing efforts and increase the number of units on rent at the new location  we are typically able to reach company average levels of profitability after several years 
the costs associated with opening a greenfield operational yard are lower than a fully staffed branch which should have a comparatively positive effect on margins 
when we enter a new market  we incur certain costs in developing new infrastructure 
for example  advertising and marketing costs will be incurred and certain minimum levels of staffing and delivery equipment will be put in place regardless of the new market s revenue base 
once we have achieved revenues during any period that are sufficient to cover our fixed expenses  we are able to generate relatively high margins on incremental lease revenues 
therefore  each additional unit rented in excess of the break even level contributes significantly to profitability 
when we refer to our operating leverage in this discussion  we are describing the impact on margins once we either cover our fixed costs or if we incur additional fixed costs in a market 
the level of non residential construction activity is an important external factor that we examine to access market trends and determine the direction of our business 
because of the degree of our operating leverage  increases or decreases in non residential construction activity can have a significant effect on our operating margins and net income 
beginning in the second quarter of  the level of our construction related business slowed down and then declined 
this decline continued and adversely affected our results of operations 
our construction related business is slowly returning to pre levels 
the level of our construction business began to increase in in each of and  it improved year over year  compared to the prior year 
customers in the construction industry represented approximately and of our leased units at december  and  respectively 
in managing our business  we focus on growing leasing revenues  particularly in existing markets where we can take advantage of the operating leverage inherent in our business model 
our goals are to increase operating margins as we continue to grow leasing revenues 
we are a capital intensive business 
therefore  in addition to focusing on earnings per share eps  we focus on adjusted ebitda to measure our operating results 
we calculate this number by first calculating ebitda  which we define as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and debt restructuring or extinguishment expense  including any write off of deferred financing costs 
this measure eliminates the effect of financing transactions that we enter into and it provides us with a means to track internally generated cash from which we can fund our interest expense and our lease fleet growth 
in comparing ebitda from year to year  we typically further adjust ebitda to exclude the effect of what we consider transactions or events not related to our core business operations to arrive at what we define as adjusted ebitda 

table of contents in managing our business  we measure our adjusted ebitda margins from year to year based on the size of the branch 
we define this margin as adjusted ebitda divided by our total revenues  expressed as a percentage 
we use this comparison  for example  to study internally the effect that increased costs have on our margins 
as capital is invested in our established branch locations  we achieve higher adjusted ebitda margins on that capital than we achieve on capital invested to establish a new branch  because our fixed costs are already in place in connection with the established branches 
the fixed costs are those associated with yard and delivery equipment  as well as advertising  sales  marketing and office expenses 
with a new branch or operational yard  we must first fund and absorb the start up costs for setting up the new location  hiring and developing the management and sales team and developing our marketing and advertising programs 
a new location will have lower adjusted ebitda margins in its early years until the branch increases the number of units it has on rent 
because this operating leverage creates higher operating margins on incremental lease revenue  which we realize on a branch by branch basis when the branch achieves leasing revenues sufficient to cover the branch s fixed costs  leasing revenues in excess of the break even amount produce large increases in profitability 
conversely  absent growth in leasing revenues  the adjusted ebitda margin at a branch is expected to remain relatively flat on a period by period comparative basis if expenses remained the same or would decrease if fixed costs increased 
because ebitda  adjusted ebitda  ebitda margin and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap financial measures  as defined by the sec  we include in this annual report reconciliations of ebitda to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
these reconciliations are included in item selected financial data 
accounting and operating overview our leasing revenues include all rent and ancillary revenues we receive for our portable storage containers and combination storage office and mobile office units 
our sales revenues include sales of these units to customers 
our other revenues consist principally of charges for the delivery of the units we sell 
our principal operating expenses are i cost of sales  ii leasing  selling and general expenses and iii depreciation and amortization  primarily depreciation of the portable storage units and mobile offices in our lease fleet 
cost of sales is the cost of the units that we sold during the reported period and includes both our cost to buy  transport  remanufacture and modify used ocean going containers and our cost to manufacture portable storage units and other structures 
leasing  selling and general expenses include  among other expenses  payroll and payroll related costs  advertising and other marketing expenses  real property lease expenses  commissions  repair and maintenance costs of our lease fleet and transportation equipment  stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses for both our leasing and sales activities 
annual repair and maintenance expenses on our leased units over the last three years have averaged approximately of lease revenues and are included in leasing  selling and general expenses 
these expenses tend to increase during periods when utilization is increasing 
we expense our normal repair and maintenance costs as incurred including the cost of periodically repainting units 
our principal asset is our container lease fleet  which has historically maintained an appraised value close to its original cost 
our lease fleet primarily consists of remanufactured and modified steel portable storage containers  steel security offices  steel combination offices and wood mobile offices that are leased to customers under short term operating lease agreements with varying terms 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of our units  after the date that we put the unit in service  and are depreciated down to their estimated residual values 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
the depreciation policy is supported by our historical lease fleet data  which shows that we have been able to obtain comparable rental rates and sales prices irrespective of the age of our container lease fleet 
wood office units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over seven years to an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses  are of much lower quality than storage containers and consequently depreciate more rapidly 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
during the last five fiscal years  our annual utilization levels averaged and ranged from a low of in to a high of in average lease fleet utilization in increased to from in historically  our average utilization has been somewhat seasonal with the low normally being realized in the first quarter and the high realized in the fourth quarter of each year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources leasing is a capital intensive business that requires us to acquire assets before they generate revenues  cash flow and earnings 
the assets that we lease have very long useful lives and require relatively little recurrent maintenance expenditures 
most of the capital we have deployed in our leasing business historically has been used to expand our operations geographically  to increase the number of units available for lease at our existing locations  and to add to the mix of products we offer 
during recent years  our operations have generated annual cash flow that exceeds our pre tax earnings  particularly due to cash flow from operations and the deferral of income taxes caused by accelerated depreciation of our fixed assets in our tax return filings 
for the past five years  we were cash flow positive after capital expenditures but excluding the merger 
during the past four years  our capital expenditures and acquisitions have been funded by our cash flow from operations 
our cash flow from operations is generally weaker during the first quarter of each fiscal year  when customers who leased containers for holiday storage return the units and as a result of seasonal weather in certain of our markets 
since  we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures and were able to fund any capital expenditures with cash flow from operations 
we expect this trend to continue in as our utilization and demand for certain product types increases  we may spend more to meet those demands  as was the case in the uk during in addition to cash flow generated by operations  our principal current source of liquidity is our credit agreement described below 
revolving credit facility 
on february   we entered into our new million abl credit agreement with deutsche bank ag new york branch and other lenders party thereto the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a five year  revolving credit facility and replaced our million credit agreement  dated june   as amended 
all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are due on february  the obligations of us and our subsidiary guarantors under the credit agreement are secured by a blanket lien on substantially all of our assets 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding and million of additional borrowing availability under the credit agreement  based upon borrowing base calculations as of such date 
we were in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as of december  and were above the minimum borrowing availability threshold and therefore not subject to any financial maintenance covenants 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement and repaid or prepaid during the term may be reborrowed 
outstanding amounts under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at either i libor plus a defined margin  or ii the agent bank s prime rate plus a margin 
the initial applicable margins for each type of loan were for libor loans and for base rate loans for six months after february  thereafter  the applicable margin for each type of loan is based on an availability based pricing grid and ranges from to for libor loans and to for base rate loans at each measurement date 
based on the pricing grid at december   the applicable margins are for libor loans and for base rate loans and will be remeasured at the end of the next measurement date  which is within days following the end of each fiscal quarter 
availability of borrowings under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based upon a valuation of our eligible accounts receivable  eligible container fleet including containers held for sale  work in process and raw materials and machinery and equipment  each multiplied by an applicable advance rate or limit 
the lease fleet is appraised at least once annually by a third party appraisal firm and up to of the net orderly liquidation value  as defined in the credit agreement  is included in the borrowing base to determine how much we may borrow under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for uk borrowings  which are  at our option  denominated in either pounds sterling or euros  by our uk subsidiary based upon a uk borrowing base  canadian borrowings  which are denominated in canadian dollars  by our canadian subsidiary based upon a canadian borrowing base  and us borrowings  which are denominated in us dollars  based upon a us borrowing base along with any canadian assets not included in the canadian subsidiary 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things i allow certain liens to attach to the company or its subsidiary assets  ii repurchase or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on capital stock and certain other securities  prepay certain indebtedness or make acquisitions or other investments subject to payment conditions as defined in the credit agreement  and iii incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions 
payment conditions allow restricted payments and acquisitions to occur without financial covenants as long as we have million of pro forma excess borrowing availability under the credit agreement 
we must also comply with specified financial maintenance covenants and affirmative covenants only if we fall below million of borrowing availability levels 
we believe our cash provided by operating activities will provide for our normal capital needs for the next twelve months 
if not  we have sufficient borrowings available under our credit agreement to meet any additional funding requirements 
we monitor the financial strength of our lenders on an ongoing basis using publicly available information 
based upon that information  we do not presently believe that there is a likelihood that any of our lenders will be unable to honor their respective commitments under the credit agreement 

table of contents senior notes 
at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due the notes 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually in arrears on june and december of each year 
the million outstanding principal balance of the notes was fully redeemed on august  we drew upon our credit agreement to fund the redemption 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million in and million in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in net income  after giving effect to non cash items  partially offset by an increase in working capital 
in  working capital was primarily affected by a decrease in accounts payable caused by the timing of scheduled payments compared to the prior year 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily attributable to an increase in net income  after giving effect to non cash items  and to a lesser extent  reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in compared to the prior year 
cash provided by operating activities is enhanced by the deferral of most income taxes due to the rapid tax depreciation rate of our assets and our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
at december   we had a federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a net deferred tax liability of million 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to net cash used of million in and cash provided of million in in  we acquired a business for a payment of million  compared to acquisitions of million in we did not have any acquisitions in capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  was million in  compared to net cash proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
our lease fleet capital expenditures  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  increased in as we added lease fleet to higher utilization markets  primarily in the uk our capital expenditures for our lease fleet increased in  as we acquired and remanufactured more units with the increased level of our leasing activity and prepared units for lease at the new locations 
proceeds from sale of lease fleet units decreased  compared to  and increased in  compared to additions to the lease fleet primarily included remanufacturing of prior acquisition units and manufactured steel offices 
during the past several years  we have continued the customization of our fleet  enabling us to differentiate our products from our competitors products  and we have complimented our lease fleet by adding steel security offices 
we anticipate our near term investing activities will be primarily focused on remanufacturing units acquired in acquisitions to meet our lease fleet standards as these units are placed on lease as well as adding lease fleet in higher utilization markets  including the uk capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  net of proceeds from any sale of property  plant and equipment  were million in  million in and million in the expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for replacement of our transportation equipment and upgrades to technology equipment 
the expenditures for property  plant and equipment in were primarily for delivery equipment  technology and communication improvements and improvements to our branch locations 
the amount of cash that we use during any period in investing activities is almost entirely within management s discretion 
we have no contracts or other arrangements pursuant to which we are required to purchase a fixed or minimum amount of goods or services in connection with any portion of our business 
maintenance capital expenditures is the cost to replace old forklifts  trucks and trailers that we use to move and deliver our products to our customers  and for replacements to enhance our computer information and communication systems 
our maintenance capital replacements were approximately million in  million in and million in financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in in  reductions in our net borrowings under our credit agreement was million  before giving effect to redeeming million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in connection with the redemption of the notes  we incurred approximately million in redemption premiums 
additionally in  we incurred financing costs of approximately million for the new credit agreement entered into on february  in  we reduced our net borrowings under our prior credit agreement by million in addition to redeeming million principal amount of msg notes 
in connection with the redemption of the msg notes we incurred approximately million in tender premiums 
in november  we received approximately million in net proceeds from the issuance of the notes  which we used to redeem million in principal amount of msg notes 
in conjunction with the redemption of the msg notes  we incurred approximately million in tender and consent premiums 
earlier in  we redeemed million of the msg notes 
in  we reduced our net borrowings under our prior credit agreement by million in addition to reducing other net debt obligations by million 
we received million  million and million from the exercises of employee stock options and the related tax benefits in  and  respectively 
as of december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our credit agreement and approximately million of additional borrowings were available to us under such agreement 
hedging activities 
interest rate swap agreements are the only instruments that we have used to manage our interest rate fluctuations affecting our variable rate debt 
we historically have entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fixed the interest rate so that the rate is payable based upon a spread from fixed rates  rather than a spread from the libor rate 
at december  and december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments our contractual obligations primarily consist of our outstanding balance under the credit agreement and million aggregate principal amount of the notes  together with other primarily unsecured notes payable obligations and obligations under capital leases 
we also have operating lease commitments for i real estate properties for the majority of our locations with remaining lease terms typically ranging from one to five years  ii delivery  transportation and yard equipment  typically under a five year lease with purchase options at the end of the lease term at a stated or fair market value price and iii office related equipment 
at december   primarily in connection with securing of our insurance policies  we provided certain insurance carriers and others with approximately million in letters of credit 
we currently do not have any obligations under purchase agreements or commitments 
historically  we have entered into capitalized lease obligations from time to time 
at december   we had million in capital lease obligations 
the table below provides a summary of our contractual commitments as of december  the operating lease amounts include certain real estate leases that expire in  but have lease renewal options that we currently anticipate to exercise in at the end of the initial lease period

seasonality demand from some of our customers is somewhat seasonal 
demand for leases of our portable storage units by large retailers is stronger from september through december because these retailers need to store more inventories for the holiday season 
these retailers usually return these leased units to us in december and early in the following year 
this seasonality has historically caused lower utilization rates for our lease fleet and a marginal decrease in our operating cash flow during the first quarter of each year 

table of contents critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  some of which require significant judgment 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events  and these estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to our financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including multiple element arrangements  in accordance with the provisions of applicable accounting guidance 
we generate revenue from the leasing of portable storage containers and office units  as well as other services such as pickup and delivery 
in most instances  we provide some of the above services under the terms of a single customer lease agreement 
we also generate revenue from the sale of containers and office units 
our lease arrangements typically include lease deliverables such as the lease of container or office unit and ancillary charges related to the leased container or office unit during the lease term 
arrangement consideration is allocated between lease deliverables and non lease deliverables based on the relative estimated selling leasing price of each deliverable 
estimated selling leasing price of the lease deliverables is based on the price of those deliverables when sold separately vendor specific objective evidence 
because delivery and pick up services are not sold separately by us  the estimated selling price of those deliverables is based on prices charged for similar services provided by other vendors third party evidence of fair value 
the arrangement consideration allocated to lease deliverables is accounted for pursuant to accounting guidance on leases 
such revenues from leases are billed in advance and recognized as earned  on a straight line basis over the lease period specified in the associated lease agreement 
lease agreement terms typically span several months or longer 
because the term of the agreements can extend across financial reporting periods  when leases are billed in advance  we defer recognition of revenue and record unearned leasing revenue at the end of reporting period so that rental revenue is included in the appropriate period 
transportation revenue from container and mobile office delivery service is recognized on the delivery date and is recognized for pick up service when the container or office unit is picked up 
we recognize revenues from sales of containers and office units upon delivery when the risk of loss passes  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we sell our products pursuant to sales contracts stating the fixed sales price with its customers 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation using the modified prospective transition method and recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the consolidated statements of income 
the fair value of our share based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of grant 
we historically have not paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend rate 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in the past  we have issued stock options and restricted stock  which we also refer to as nonvested share awards 
for stock options and nonvested share awards subject solely to service conditions  we recognize expense using the straight line method 
for nonvested share awards subject to service and performance conditions  we are required to assess the probability that such performance conditions will be met 
if the likelihood of the performance condition being met is deemed probable  we will recognize the expense using the accelerated attribution method 
in addition  for both stock options and nonvested share awards  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested share awards at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of share based compensation 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we establish and maintain reserves against estimated losses based upon historical loss experience and evaluation of past due accounts receivables 
management reviews the level of the allowances for doubtful accounts on a regular basis and adjusts the level of the allowances as needed 
if we were to increase the factors used for our reserve estimates by  it would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted eps as follows years ended december  in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
impairment of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical  expected or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  our market capitalization relative to net book value  and significant negative industry or general economic trends 
we operate in two reportable segments  which are comprised of three operating segments that also represent our reporting units north america  the uk and the netherlands 
all of our goodwill was allocated between these three reporting units 
at december   only north america and the uk have goodwill subject to impairment testing 
we perform an annual impairment test on goodwill at december in addition  we perform impairment tests during any reporting period in which events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have incurred 
in assessing the fair value of the reporting units  we consider both the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on quoted market prices of companies comparable to the reporting unit being valued 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimated future revenue growth rates  gross margins on sales  operating margins  capital expenditures  tax payments and discount rates 
each approach is given equal weight in arriving at the fair value of the reporting unit 
as of december   management assessed qualitative factors and determined it is more likely than not each of our two reporting units assigned goodwill had estimated fair values greater than the respective reporting unit s individual net asset carrying values  therefore  the two step impairment test was not required 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review property  plant and equipment and intangibles with finite lives those assets resulting from acquisitions for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  whether due to new information or other factors  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
there were no indicators of impairment at december  and depreciation policy 
our depreciation policy for our lease fleet uses the straight line method over the estimated useful life of our units  after the date that we put the unit in service 
our steel units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
wood offices units are depreciated over years with an estimated residual value of 
van trailers  which are a small part of our fleet  are depreciated over seven years to an estimated residual value 
we have other non core products that have various other measures of useful lives and residual values 
van trailers and other non core products are typically only added to the fleet as a result of acquisitions of portable storage businesses 

table of contents we periodically review our depreciation policy against various factors  including the results of our lenders independent appraisal of our lease fleet  practices of the competitors in our industry  profit margins we achieve on sales of depreciated units and lease rates we obtain on older units 
if we were to change our depreciation policy on our steel units from a residual value and a year life to a lower or higher residual value and a shorter or longer useful life  such change could have a positive  negative or neutral effect on our earnings  with the actual effect determined by the change 
for example  a change in our estimates used in our residual values and useful life would have the following approximate effect on our net income and diluted eps as reflected in the table below 
residual value useful life in years in thousands except per share data as reported net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps as adjusted for change in estimates net income diluted eps insurance reserves 
our worker s compensation  auto and general liability insurance are purchased under large deductible programs 
our current per incident deductibles are worker s compensation  auto  and general liability  we provide for the estimated expense relating to the deductible portion of the individual claims 
however  we generally do not know the full amount of our exposure to a deductible in connection with any particular claim during the fiscal period in which the claim is incurred and for which we must make an accrual for the deductible expense 
we make these accruals based on a combination of the claims development experience of our staff and our insurance companies 
at year end  the accrual is reviewed and adjusted  in part  based on an independent actuarial review of historical loss data and using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
a high degree of judgment is required in developing these estimates of amounts to be accrued  as well as in connection with the underlying assumptions 
in addition  our assumptions will change as our loss experience is developed 
all of these factors have the potential for significantly impacting the amounts we have previously reserved in respect of anticipated deductible expenses  and we may be required in the future to increase or decrease amounts previously accrued 
our north america health benefits programs are considered to be self insured products  however  we buy excess insurance coverage that limits our medical liability exposure on a per individual insured basis 
additionally  our medical program has a limitation on our total aggregate claim exposure and we accrue and reserve to the total projected losses 
our canadian and european employees are primarily provided medical coverage through their governmental national insurance programs 
contingencies 
we are a party to various claims and litigation in the normal course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to various claims and pending litigation is based on claims for which our management can determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of incurred and possible range of loss on pending claims and litigation  management must use considerable judgment in making reasonable determination of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation 
we do not anticipate the resolution of such matters known at this time will have a material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position 

table of contents deferred taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense 
at december   we had a million valuation allowance and million of gross deferred tax assets included within the net deferred tax liability on our balance sheet 
the majority of the deferred tax asset relates to federal net operating loss carryforwards that have future expiration dates 
management currently believes that adequate future taxable income will be generated through future operations  or through available tax planning strategies to recover these assets 
however  given that these federal net operating loss carryforwards that give rise to the deferred tax asset expire over years beginning in  there could be changes in management s judgment in future periods with respect to the recoverability of these assets 
as of december   management believes that it is more likely than not that the unreserved portion of these deferred tax assets will be recovered 
purchase accounting 
we account for acquisitions under the purchase method 
under the purchase method of accounting  the price paid by us  is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets and liabilities acquired represents goodwill that is subject to annual impairment testing 
earnings per share 
basic net income per share is calculated by dividing income allocable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding  net of shares subject to repurchase by us during the period 
income allocable to common stockholders is net income less the earnings allocable to preferred stockholders  if applicable 
diluted net income per share is calculated under the if converted method unless the conversion of the preferred stock is anti dilutive to basic net income per share 
to the extent the inclusion of preferred stock is anti dilutive  we calculate diluted net income per share under the two class method 
potential common shares include restricted common stock and incremental shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of stock options and vesting of nonvested share awards and upon conversion of convertible preferred stock using the treasury stock method 
recent accounting pronouncements comprehensive income 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the existing guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  entities have the option to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
entities no longer have the option of presenting the components of other comprehensive income within the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
this amendment was effective on a retrospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   which for us was the first quarter of the adoption of this amendment resulted in a change to our current presentation of comprehensive income  but did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
under the amended guidance discussed in the preceding paragraph  an entity is required to present the effect of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income in both net income and other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued an amendment to this provision which deferred the effective date of the presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this amendment is effective on a prospective basis for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this amendment will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
fair value measurement 
in may  the fasb issued amendments to the existing guidance on fair value measurement 
the amendments are intended to create consistency between gaap and international financial reporting standards on measuring fair value and disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the amendments clarify the application of existing fair value measurement requirements including i the application of the highest and best use valuation premise concepts  ii measuring the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity s stockholders equity  and iii quantitative information required for fair value measurements categorized within level in addition  the amendments require additional disclosure for level measurements regarding the sensitivity of fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and any interrelationships between those inputs 
these amendments are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for us is calendar year these changes are required to be applied prospectively 
the adoption of these amendments did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate swap agreement 
at december   we did not have any outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in the past  we have entered into derivative financial arrangements only to the extent that the arrangement was to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with changes in interest rates  and we do not engage in such transactions for speculative purposes 
the following table sets forth the scheduled maturities and the total fair value of our debt portfolio as of december  at december  total at december  total fair value at december  thereafter in thousands  except percentages debt fixed rate average interest rate floating rate average interest rate operating leases impact of foreign currency rate changes 
we currently have branch operations outside the us and we bill those customers primarily in their local currency  which is subject to foreign currency rate changes 
our operations in canada are billed in the canadian dollar  operations in the uk are billed in pound sterling and operations in the netherlands are billed in the euro 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of our non us operations are translated into non us dollars 
the impact of foreign currency rate changes has historically been insignificant with our canadian operations  but we have more exposure to volatility with our european operations 
in order to help minimize our exchange rate gain and loss volatility  we finance our european entities through our revolving line of credit which allows us  at our option  to borrow funds locally in pound sterling denominated debt
