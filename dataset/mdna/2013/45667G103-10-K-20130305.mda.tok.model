table of contents item a 
risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and in other documents we file with the sec  are risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
we have a history of significant operating losses and may not achieve profitability on an annual basis in the future 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   we recorded a net loss of million and million  respectively 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to continue to make significant expenditures related to the continued development of our business 
these expenditures may include the addition of personnel related to the sales  marketing and research and development of our products and other costs related to the maintenance and expansion of our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations 
we may therefore sustain significant operating losses and negative cash flows in the future 
we will have to maintain significant increased revenue and product gross margins to achieve profitability on an annual basis 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
over the past four fiscal quarters  our revenue has ranged from million to million and our operating loss has ranged from million to million 
as a result  comparing our operating results on a period to period basis may not be meaningful 
our budgeted expense levels are based  in large part  on our expectations of long term future revenue and the development efforts associated with these future revenues 
as a result  fluctuations in our revenue and gross margins will have a significant impact on our operating results 
given the relatively fixed nature of our operating costs including those relating to our personnel and facilities  particularly for our engineering personnel  any substantial adjustment to our expenses to account for lower levels of revenue will be difficult and may take time 
consequently  if our revenue does not meet projected levels in the short term  our inventory levels and operating expenses would be high relative to revenue  resulting in additional operating losses 
in addition to other risks discussed in this section  factors that may contribute to fluctuations in our revenue and our operating results include fluctuations in demand  sales cycles and prices for products and services  including discounts given in response to competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in our product mix  including the mix of higher and lower margin products and significant mix changes resulting from new customer deployments  changes in customers budgets for optical communications network equipment purchases and changes in their purchasing cycles  order cancellations or reductions or delays in delivery schedules by our customers  timeliness of our customers payments for their purchases  our ability to control costs  including our operating expenses and the costs of components we purchase for our products  readiness of customer sites for installation of our products  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors 
in particular  if we fail to achieve targeted release dates for our future products  or convert lab trials and field evaluations by potential customers into purchase orders  our revenue and operating results may be negatively impacted  
table of contents any significant changes in the competitive dynamics of our market  including any new entrants  technological advances or substantial discounting of products  availability of third party suppliers to provide contract engineering and installation services for us  the timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter  including the impact of revenue recognition standards and any future changes in us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or new interpretations of existing accounting rules  and general economic conditions in domestic and international markets 
many factors affecting our results of operations are beyond our control and make it difficult to predict our results for a particular quarter or to accurately predict future revenues beyond a one quarter time horizon 
if our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may in the future provide to the market  the price of our common stock may decline substantially 
our gross margins may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and may be adversely affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
our gross margins fluctuate from period to period and vary by customer and by product specification 
over the past four fiscal quarters  our gross margins have ranged from to 
our gross margins are likely to continue to fluctuate and will be affected by a number of factors  including the mix in any period of the customers purchasing our products and the product mix  including the relative mix of higher and lower margin products and services  significant new customer deployments  often with a higher portion of lower or negative margin common equipment  price discounts negotiated by our customers  introduction of new products  such as the dtn x platform  with initial sales at relatively small volumes and higher product costs  sales volume from each customer during the period  the amount of equipment we sell or expect to sell for a loss in any given quarter  increased price competition  including competition from low cost producers from china  charges for excess or obsolete inventory  changes in the price or availability of components for our products  changes in our manufacturing costs  including fluctuations in yields and production volumes  and increased warranty or repair costs 
it is likely that the average unit prices of our products will decrease over time in response to competitive pricing pressures  increased negotiated sales discounts  new product introductions by us or our competitors or other factors 
in addition  some of our customer contracts contain annual technology discounts that require us to decrease the sales price of our products to these customers 
in response  we will need to reduce the cost of our products through manufacturing efficiencies  design improvements and cost reductions 
if these efforts are not successful or if we are unable to reduce our costs to a greater extent than the reduction in the price of our products  our revenue and gross margin will decline  causing our operating results to decline 
fluctuations in gross margin may make it difficult to manage our business and achieve or maintain profitability 
aggressive business tactics by our competitors may harm our business 
the markets in which we compete are extremely competitive and have resulted in aggressive business tactics by our competitors  including aggressively pricing their products  including offering significant one time discounts and guaranteed future price decreases  
table of contents providing financing  marketing and advertising assistance to customers  announcing competing products prior to market availability combined with extensive marketing efforts  influencing customer requirements to emphasize different product capabilities  such as greater minimum bandwidth requirements or higher transport speeds  offering to repurchase our equipment from existing customers  and asserting intellectual property rights 
the level of competition and pricing pressure tend to increase during periods of economic weakness or during periods when there are fewer network build out projects 
if we fail to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  or if our current or future competitors continue or expand aggressive business tactics  including those described above  demand for our products could decline  we could experience delays or cancellations of customer orders  or we could be required to reduce our prices or increase our expenses 
our ability to increase our revenue will depend upon continued growth of demand by consumers and businesses for additional network capacity 
our future success depends on factors that increase the amount of data transmitted over communications networks and the growth of optical communications networks to meet the increased demand for optical capacity 
these factors include the growth of mobility  video  cloud based services  increased broadband connectivity and the continuing adoption of high capacity  revenue generating services 
if demand for such bandwidth does not continue  or slows down  the need for increased bandwidth across networks and the market for optical communications network products may not continue to grow and our product sales would be negatively impacted 
in addition  if general economic conditions weaken  our customers and potential customers may slow or delay their purchase decisions  which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
any delays in the development and introduction of our products  and any future delays in releasing new products or in releasing enhancements to our existing products may harm our business 
because our products are based on complex technology  including  in some cases  the development of next generation pics and specialized asics  we may experience unanticipated delays in developing  improving  manufacturing or deploying these products 
the development process for our pics is lengthy  and any modifications to our pics  including the development of our next generation pics  entail significant development cost and risks 
at any given time  various new product introductions and enhancements to our existing products  such as future products based on our next generation pics  are in the development phase and are not yet ready for commercial manufacturing or deployment 
we rely on third parties  some of which are relatively early stage companies  to develop and manufacture components for our next generation products  which can require custom development 
the maturing process from laboratory prototype to customer trials  and subsequently to general availability  involves a significant number of simultaneous development efforts 
these efforts often must be completed in a timely manner so that they may be introduced into the product development cycle for our systems  and include completion of product development  including the completion of any associated pic development  such as our next generation pics  and the completion of associated module development  including modules developed by third parties  the qualification and multiple sourcing of critical components  validation of manufacturing methods and processes  extensive quality assurance and reliability testing and staffing of testing infrastructure  validation of software  and establishment of systems integration and systems test validation requirements 
each of these steps  in turn  presents risks of failure  rework or delay  any one of which could decrease the speed and scope of product introduction and marketplace acceptance of our products 
new generations of our 
table of contents pics  specialized asics and intensive software testing are important to the timely introduction of new products and enhancements to our existing products  and are subject to these development risks 
in addition  unexpected intellectual property disputes  failure of critical design elements  and a host of other development execution risks may delay  or even prevent  the introduction of new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not develop and successfully introduce or enhance products in a timely manner  our competitive position will suffer 
in addition  if we do not develop and successfully introduce or enhance products in sufficient time so as to satisfy our customer s expectations  we may lose future business from such customers and harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which would harm our business and operating results 
the introduction of our dtn x platform may adversely impact the timing of our revenues  our results of operations and our margins 
we began shipping our new dtn x platform in the second quarter of and recognized initial revenues for the dtn x platform in the third quarter of as a relatively new product  we face increased product introduction risks including risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of the dtn x platform  delays in the development or manufacturing of the dtn x platform  reliability  quality or other defects  and delays in customer purchases 
in addition  the dtn x platform is subject to more significant cost variations and increased difficulty in predicting customer demand and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand 
the introduction of the dtn x platform  with similar  but enhanced functionality to the dtn platform  increases the risk that customers may forego purchases of the dtn platform in favor of the dtn x platform 
accordingly  a portion of our dtn platform revenues will be impacted by this new product as some of our customers and prospects will choose to purchase the dtn x platform in place of the dtn platform 
in addition  the introduction of the dtn x platform may put pressure on the price of our existing dtn platform 
because the dtn x platform is a new product for which customers may require additional testing requirements prior to acceptance  initial revenue recognition for the dtn x platform may take longer than for sales of the dtn platform 
any delay in our ability to convert lab trials and field evaluations by potential customers into purchase orders  or in our ability to recognize revenue from the dtn x may adversely impact our quarterly revenue results 
in addition  if we are required to write off or write down a significant amount of inventory  our results of operations for the period would be adversely affected 
we may be required to recognize costs and expenses for our dtn x platform before we can recognize the related revenue 
accordingly  until we can ramp up the manufacture of our dtn x platform  our margins related to the initial sales of the dtn x platform will be negatively impacted 
such uncertainty related to the introduction and market acceptance of our dtn x platform could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and dominated by large corporations  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition in the optical networking equipment market is intense  and we expect such competition to increase 
a number of very large companies have historically dominated the optical communications network equipment industry 
our competitors include current wavelength division multiplexing suppliers  such as alcatel lucent  ciena corporation  cisco systems  ericsson  fujitsu limited  huawei technologies co  nec corporation  tellabs and zte corporation 
competition in these markets is based on price  commercial terms  functionality  manufacturing capability  pre existing installations  services  existing business and customer relationships  scalability and the ability of products and breadth and quality of services to meet our customers immediate and future network requirements 
other companies have  or may in the future develop  products that are or could be competitive with our products 
in particular  if a competitor develops a photonic integrated circuit with similar functionality to our pics  our business could be harmed 
recent mergers from our competitors and any future acquisitions or combinations between or among our competitors may adversely affect our competitive position by strengthening our competitors 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources  greater manufacturing capacity and better established relationships with incumbent carriers and other potential customers than we have 
many of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire  and more experience in developing or acquiring  new products and technologies and in creating market awareness for those 
table of contents products and technologies 
in addition  many of our competitors have the financial resources to offer competitive products at aggressive pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively 
further  many of our competitors have built long standing relationships with some of our prospective customers and have the ability to provide financing to customers and could  therefore  have an inherent advantage in selling products to those customers 
we compete with low cost producers from china that can increase pricing pressure on us and a number of smaller companies that provide competition for a specific product  customer segment or geographic market 
these competitors often base their products on the latest available technologies 
due to the narrower focus of their efforts  these competitors may achieve commercial availability of their products more quickly than we can and may provide attractive alternatives to our customers 
our large customers have substantial negotiating leverage  which may require that we agree to terms and conditions that result in increased cost of sales  decreased revenue and lower average selling prices and gross margins  all of which would harm our operating results 
substantial changes in the optical networking industry have occurred over the last few years 
many potential customers have confronted static or declining revenue 
many of our customers have substantial debt burdens  many have experienced financial distress  and some have gone out of business  been acquired by other service providers  or announced their withdrawal from segments of the business 
consolidation in the markets in which we compete has resulted in changes in the structure of the communications networking industry  with greater concentration of purchasing power in a small number of large service providers  cable operators  internet content providers and government agencies 
the increased concentration among our customer base may also lead to increased competition for new network deployments and increased negotiating power for our customers 
this may require us to decrease our average selling prices which would have an adverse impact on our operating results 
further  many of our customers are large communications service providers that have substantial purchasing power and leverage in negotiating contractual arrangements with us 
our customers have and may continue to seek advantageous pricing  payment and other commercial terms and may require us to develop additional features in the products we sell to them 
if we are required to develop additional features for our product for a customer  we may be required to defer some of our revenue for such a customer until we have developed and delivered such additional features 
we have and may continue to be required to agree to unfavorable commercial terms with these customers  including reducing the average selling price of our products or agreeing to extended payment terms in response to these commercial requirements or competitive pricing pressures 
to maintain acceptable operating results  we will need to comply with these commercial terms  develop and introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis and continue to reduce our costs 
we expect the factors described above to continue to affect our business and operating results for an indeterminate period  in several ways  including overall capital expenditures by many of our customers or potential customers may be flat or reduced  we will continue to have only limited ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales  managing expenditures and inventory will be difficult in light of the uncertainties surrounding our business  and increased competition will enable customers to insist on more favorable terms and conditions for sales  including product discounts  extended payment terms or financing assistance  as a condition of procuring their business 
if we are unable to offset any reductions in our average selling prices with increased sales volumes and reduced production costs  or if we fail to develop and introduce new products and enhancements on a timely basis  or if we disagree on our interpretation and compliance with the commercial terms of our customer agreements  our relationships with our customers and our operating results would be harmed 
we must respond to rapid technological change and comply with evolving industry standards and requirements for our products to be successful 
the optical networking equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we continually invest in research and development to 
table of contents sustain or enhance our existing products  but the introduction of new communications technologies and the emergence of new industry standards or requirements could render our products obsolete 
further  in developing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions with respect to which standards or requirements will be adopted by our customers and competitors 
if the standards or requirements adopted by our prospective customers are different from those on which we have focused our efforts  market acceptance of our products would be reduced or delayed and our business would be harmed 
we are continuing to invest a significant portion of our research and development efforts in the development of our next generation products 
we expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and technologies and to influence customers buying criteria so as to emphasize product capabilities that we do not  or may not  possess 
to be competitive  we must properly anticipate future customer requirements and we must continue to invest significant resources in research and development  sales and marketing and customer support 
if we do not anticipate these future customer requirements and invest in the technologies necessary to enable us to have and to sell the appropriate solutions  it may limit our competitive position and future sales  which would have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
we may not have sufficient resources to make these investments and we may not be able to make the technological advances necessary to be competitive 
we are dependent on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components  and if we fail to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will not meet our customers product delivery requirements 
we currently purchase several key components for our products from single or limited sources 
in particular  we rely on our own production of certain components of our products  such as pics  and on third parties as sole source suppliers for certain of the components of our products  including asics  field programmable gate arrays  processors  and other semiconductor and optical components 
we purchase these items on a purchase order basis and have no long term contracts with many of these sole source suppliers 
we have increased our reliance on third parties to develop and manufacture components for certain products gbps and gbps  some of which require custom development 
for example  for the gbps application of our dtn platform  we purchase customized discrete components 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers suffer from capacity constraints  lower than expected yields  deployment delays  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule which could result in lost revenue  additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships 
further  our suppliers could enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  refuse to sell their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices or at all  go out of business or discontinue their relationships with us 
we may be unable to develop alternative sources for these components 
the loss of a source of supply  or lack of sufficient availability of key components  could require us to redesign products that use such components  which could result in lost revenue  additional product costs and deployment delays that could harm our business and customer relationships 
if we do not receive critical components for our products in a timely manner  we will be unable to deliver those components to our contract manufacturer in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet our prospective customers product delivery requirements 
in addition  the sourcing from new suppliers may require us to re design our products  which could cause delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products 
in the past  we have experienced delivery delays because of lack of availability of components or reliability issues with components that we were purchasing 
in addition  some of our suppliers have gone out of business  limited their supply of components to us  or indicated that they may be going out of business 
historically  we have seen a tightening of supply with a number of our suppliers and we have experienced longer than normal lead times and supply delays 
we may in the future experience a shortage of certain components as a result of our own manufacturing issues  manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers  capacity problem experiences by our suppliers or contract manufacturers  or strong demand in the industry for such components 
a return to growth in the economy is likely to continue to create pressure on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and manufacturing capacity 
these supplier disruptions may continue to occur in the future  which could limit our ability to produce our products and cause us to fail to meet a customer s delivery requirements 
such events could harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which would harm our business and operating results 

table of contents if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our products  we may have excess or insufficient inventory  which may increase our operating costs  decrease our revenue and harm our business 
we are required to generate forecasts of future demands for our products several months prior to the scheduled delivery to our prospective customers 
this requires us to make significant investments before we know if corresponding revenue will be recognized 
lead times for materials and components  including asics  that we need to order for the manufacture of our products vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for each component at a given time 
in the past  we have experienced lengthening in lead times for certain components 
if the lead times for components are lengthened  we may be required to purchase increased levels of such components to satisfy our delivery commitments to our customers 
if we overestimate demand for our products or particular elements of our products and increase our inventory in anticipation of customer orders that do not materialize  we will have excess inventory  we will face a risk of obsolescence and significant inventory write downs and our fixed costs will be spread across fewer units  raising our per unit costs 
if we underestimate demand for our products  we will have inadequate inventory  which could slow down or interrupt the manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and our ability to recognize revenue 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our internal projections  additional inventory write offs may be required 
in addition  we may be unable to meet our supply commitments to customers  which could result in a loss of certain customer opportunities or a breach of our customer agreements that requires payment of damages for delay 
if our contract manufacturers do not perform as we expect  our business may be harmed 
we rely on third party contract manufacturers to perform a significant portion of the manufacturing of our products  and our future success will depend on our ability to have sufficient volumes of our products manufactured in a cost effective and quality controlled manner 
we have engaged third parties to manufacture certain elements of our products at multiple contract manufacturing sites located around the world but do not have long term agreements in place with some of our manufacturers and suppliers 
there are a number of risks associated with our dependence on contract manufacturers  including reduced control over delivery schedules  particularly for international contract manufacturing sites  reliance on the quality assurance procedures of third parties  potential uncertainty regarding manufacturing yields and costs  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of high demand  potential uncertainty related to the use of international contract manufacturing sites  limited warranties on components supplied to us  potential misappropriation of our intellectual property  and potential manufacturing disruptions including disruptions caused by geopolitical events  military actions or natural disasters 
any of these risks could impair our ability to fulfill orders 
our contract manufacturers may not be able to meet the delivery requirements of our customers  which could decrease customer satisfaction and harm our product sales 
we do not have long term contracts or arrangements with our contract manufacturers that will guarantee product availability  or the continuation of particular pricing or payment terms 
if our contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our products or components of our products in required volumes or our relationship with any of our contract manufacturers is discontinued for any reason  we would be required to identify and qualify alternative manufacturers  which could cause us to be unable to meet our supply requirements to our customers and result in the breach of our customer agreements 
qualifying a new contract manufacturer and commencing volume production is expensive and time consuming and if we are required to change or qualify a new contract manufacturer  we would likely lose sales revenue and damage our existing customer relationships 

table of contents we are dependent on a small number of key customers for a significant portion of our revenue and the loss of  or a significant reduction in  orders from one or more of our key customers would reduce our revenue and harm our operating results 
a relatively small number of customers account for a large percentage of our revenue 
as a result  our business will be harmed if any of our key customers do not generate as much revenue as we forecast  stop purchasing from us  or substantially reduce their orders to us 
in addition  our business will be harmed if we fail to maintain our competitive advantage with our key customers 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our key customers will depend on our ability to maintain strong relationships with these customers and introduce new products that are desirable to these customers at competitive prices  and we may not be successful at doing so 
in most cases  our sales are made to these customers pursuant to standard purchase agreements rather than long term purchase commitments  and orders may be cancelled or reduced readily 
in the event of a cancellation or reduction of an order  we may not have enough time to reduce operating expenses to minimize the effect of the lost revenue on our business 
our operating results will continue to depend on our ability to sell our products to our key customers 
if we fail to expand sales of our products into international markets or to sell our products to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies  our revenue will be harmed 
we believe that  in order to grow our revenue and business and to build a large and diverse customer base  we must successfully sell our products in international markets and to new types of customers  such as us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
we have limited experience selling our products internationally and to us regional bell operating companies and international postal  telephone and telegraph companies 
sales cycles for these customers are often very lengthy and competition for these customers is intense 
to succeed in these sales efforts  we believe we must hire additional sales personnel to develop our relationships with these potential customers and develop and manage new sales channels through resellers  distributors and systems integrators 
if we do not succeed in our efforts to sell to these customers  the size of our total addressable market will be limited 
this  in turn  would harm our ability to grow our customer base and revenue 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could incur significant expense to enforce our rights 
we depend on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of methods to protect our intellectual property  including limiting access to certain information  and utilizing trade secret  patent  copyright and trademark laws and confidentiality agreements with employees and third parties  all of which offer only limited protection 
the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to preclude misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary information or infringement of our intellectual property rights  and our ability to police such misappropriation  unauthorized disclosure or infringement is uncertain  particularly in countries outside of the united states 
this is likely to become an increasingly important issue as we expand our operations and product development into countries that provide a lower level of intellectual property protection 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims  and even if patents are issued  they may be contested  circumvented or invalidated 
moreover  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with a competitive advantage  and  as with any technology  competitors may be able to develop similar or superior technologies to our own now or in the future 
protecting against the unauthorized use of our products  trademarks and other proprietary rights is expensive  difficult  time consuming and  in some cases  impossible 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity or scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of management resources  either of which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights than we do 
accordingly  despite our efforts  we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property 

table of contents claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property could harm our business 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  many leading companies in the optical networking industry  including our competitors  have extensive patent portfolios with respect to optical networking technology 
we expect that infringement claims may increase as the number of products and competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur 
from time to time  third parties may assert exclusive patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights to technologies and related standards that are important to our business or seek to invalidate the proprietary rights that we hold 
competitors or other third parties have  and may continue to assert claims or initiate litigation or other proceedings against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights  or seeking to invalidate our proprietary rights  with respect to our products and technology 
in the event that we are unsuccessful in defending against any such claims  or any resulting lawsuit or proceedings  we could incur liability for damages and or have valuable proprietary rights invalidated 
any claim of infringement from a third party  even one without merit  could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  and could distract our management from running our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim  if successful  could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering our products 
in addition  we might be required to seek a license for the use of such intellectual property  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
alternatively  we may be required to develop non infringing technology  which would require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful 
any of these events could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
competitors and other third parties have and may continue to assert infringement claims against our customers and sales partners 
any of these claims would require us to initiate or defend potentially protracted and costly litigation on their behalf  regardless of the merits of these claims  because we generally indemnify our customers and sales partners from claims of infringement of proprietary rights of third parties 
if any of these claims succeed  we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or sales partners  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we incorporate open source software into our products 
although we monitor our use of open source software closely  the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by us courts  and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products 
in such event  we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products  to re engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we are currently involved in litigation with cheetah and level whereby cheetah alleges that we and level infringe on two cheetah patents 
in addition  cambrian has filed suit against us and seven of our customers alleging that the use of our dtn platform by our customers infringes upon a cambrian patent 
information regarding these matters is set forth in item legal proceedings and is incorporated herein by reference 
we believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously  but are unable to predict the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome 
we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions 
in the event that cheetah or cambrian is successful in obtaining a judgment requiring us to pay damages  obtaining a judgment requiring us to indemnify our customers for damages imposed upon them  or obtaining an injunction preventing the sale of our products  our business and operating results could be harmed 
our manufacturing process is very complex and the partial or complete loss of our manufacturing facility  or a reduction in yields or an inability to scale capacity to meet customer demands could harm our business 
the manufacturing process for certain components of our products  including our pics  is technically challenging 
in the event that any of these manufacturing facilities were fully or partially destroyed  as a result of fire  water damage  or otherwise  it would limit our ability to produce our products 
because of the complex nature of our 
table of contents manufacturing facilities  such loss would take a considerable amount of time to repair or rebuild 
the partial or complete loss of any of our manufacturing facilities  or an event causing the interruption in our use of such facility for any extended period of time would cause our business  financial condition and operating results to be harmed 
minor deviations in the pic manufacturing process can cause substantial decreases in yields and  in some cases  cause production to be suspended 
in the past  we have had significant variances in our pic yields  including production interruptions and suspensions and may have continued yield variances  including additional interruptions or suspensions in the future 
we expect our manufacturing yield for our next generation pics to be lower initially and increase as we achieve full production 
poor yields from our pic manufacturing process or defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could limit our ability to satisfy customer demand requirements  and could cause us customer relations and business reputation problems  harming our business and operating results 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with third parties  could harm our relationships with customers  our business and our operating results 
upgrades to our internal business processes and systems  and problems with the design or implementation of these systems and processes  could interfere with  and therefore harm  our business  operations and ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
we implemented an enterprise resource planning erp system during the third quarter of  which resulted in a change to our system of internal control over financial reporting 
any disruptions or delays as a result of the implementation of the erp system or processes  particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations  could adversely affect our ability to run our business 
if the implementation adversely affects our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be negatively impacted 
unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions may adversely affect our industry  business and gross margins 
our business depends on the overall demand for additional bandwidth capacity and on the economic health and willingness of our customers and potential customers to make capital commitments to purchase our products and services 
as a result of macroeconomic or market uncertainty  we may face new risks that we have not yet identified 
in addition  a number of the risks associated with our business  which are disclosed in these risk factors  may increase in likelihood  magnitude or duration 
in the past  unfavorable macroeconomic and market conditions have resulted in sustained periods of decreased demand for optical communications products 
these conditions may also result in the tightening of credit markets  which may limit or delay our customers ability to obtain necessary financing for their purchases of our products 
a lack of liquidity in the capital markets or the continued uncertainty in the global economic environment may cause our customers to delay or cancel their purchases  increase the time they take to pay or default on their payment obligations  each of which would negatively affect our business and operating results 
continued weakness and uncertainty in the global economy could cause some of our customers to become illiquid  delay payments or adversely affect our collection of their accounts  which could result in a higher level of bad debt expense 
in addition  currency fluctuations could negatively affect our international customers ability or desire to purchase our products 
challenging economic conditions have from time to time contributed to slowdowns in the telecommunications industry in which we operate 
such slowdowns may result in reduced demand for our products as a result of constraints on capital spending by our customers  particularly service providers  increased price competition for our products  not only from our competitors  but also as a result of our customer s or potential customer s utilization of inventoried or underutilized products  which could put additional downward pressure on our near term gross profits  risk of excess or obsolete inventories  
table of contents excess manufacturing capacity and higher associated overhead costs as a percentage of revenue  and more limited ability to accurately forecast our business and future financial performance 
a lack of liquidity and economic uncertainty may adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products from these suppliers 
it may also cause some of our suppliers to become illiquid 
any of these impacts could limit our ability to obtain components for our products from these suppliers and could adversely impact our supply chain or the delivery schedule to our customers 
this also could require us to purchase more expensive components  or re design our products  which could cause increases in the cost of our products and delays in the manufacturing and delivery of our products 
such events could harm our gross margins and harm our reputation and our customer relationships  either of which could harm our business and operating results 
product performance problems  including undetected errors in our hardware or software  or deployment delays could harm our business and reputation 
the development and production of new products with high technology content is complicated and often involves problems with software  components and manufacturing methods 
complex hardware and software systems  such as our products  can often contain undetected errors when first introduced or as new versions are released 
in addition  errors associated with components we purchase from third parties  including customized components  may be difficult to resolve 
we have experienced errors in the past in connection with our dtn platform  including failures due to the receipt of faulty components from our suppliers 
we suspect that errors  including potentially serious errors  will be found from time to time in our products 
our products may suffer degradation of performance and reliability over time 
if reliability  quality or network monitoring problems develop  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including delays in our ability to recognize revenue  costs associated with fixing software or hardware defects or replacing products  high service and warranty expenses  delays in shipments  high inventory excess and obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  diversion of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts  delays in collecting accounts receivable  payment of damages for performance failures  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
because we outsource the manufacturing of certain components of our products  we may also be subject to product performance problems as a result of the acts or omissions of third parties 
from time to time  we encounter interruptions or delays in the activation of our products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from issues with installation and activation  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that we cannot promptly resolve  the associated revenue for these installations may be delayed or confidence in our products could be undermined  which could cause us to lose customers and fail to add new customers 
if we lose key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional qualified personnel when needed  our business may be harmed 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  and finance personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
for 
table of contents example  senior members of our engineering team have unique technical experience that would be difficult to replace 
we do not have long term employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our key personnel 
because our products are complex  we must hire and retain a large number of highly trained customer service and support personnel to ensure that the deployment of our products do not result in network disruption for our customers 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing  finance and customer service and support personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense in our industry  especially in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining appropriate personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring qualified personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our sales cycle can be long and unpredictable  which could result in an unexpected revenue shortfall in any given quarter 
our products have a lengthy sales cycle  which can extend from six to twelve months and may take even longer for larger prospective customers such as us regional bell operating companies  international postal  telephone and telegraph companies and us competitive local exchange carriers 
our prospective customers conduct significant evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance procedures before they purchase our products 
we incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort during this time  regardless of whether we make a sale 
because the purchase of our equipment involves substantial cost  most of our customers wait to purchase our equipment until they are ready to deploy it in their network 
as a result  it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of future purchases by our customers 
in addition  product purchases are often subject to budget constraints  multiple approvals and unplanned administrative processing and other delays 
if sales expected from customers for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter or at all  our revenue will be negatively impacted 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that may harm our operating results 
we market  sell and service our products globally 
in  and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenue from customers outside of the united states 
we have sales and support personnel in numerous countries worldwide 
in addition  we have a large group of development personnel located in bangalore  india  beijing  china  and kanata  canada 
we expect that significant management attention and financial resources will be required for our international activities over the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our international presence 
in some countries  our successes in selling our products will depend in part on our ability to form relationships with local partners 
our inability to identify appropriate partners or reach mutually satisfactory arrangements for international sales of our products could impact our ability to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
our international operations are subject to inherent risks  and our future results could be adversely affected by a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  difficulties of managing and staffing international offices  and the increased travel  infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations  the impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  tariff and trade barriers and other regulatory requirements or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets  certification requirements  greater difficulty documenting and testing our internal controls  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  potentially adverse tax consequences  
table of contents political and economic instability  effects of changes in currency exchange rates which could negatively affect our financial results and cash flows  and service provider and government spending patterns 
international customers may also require that we comply with certain testing or customization of our products to conform to local standards 
the product development costs to test or customize our products could be extensive and a material expense for us 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations 
our failure to manage any of these risks could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales 
we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
a portion of our sales are to countries outside of the united states  and are in currencies other than us dollars  particularly the euro 
accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency rates  most notably the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro  could have a material impact on our revenue in future periods 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on accounts receivable denominated in euro 
these hedging programs reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on certain transactions  but do not cover all foreign denominated transactions and therefore do not entirely eliminate the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates which could negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future  the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected 
we are required to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of the provisions of the act require  among other things  that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures 
preparing our financial statements involves a number of complex processes  many of which are done manually and are dependent upon individual data input or review 
these processes include  but are not limited to  calculating revenue  deferred revenue and inventory costs 
while we continue to automate our processes and enhance our review and put in place controls to reduce the likelihood for errors  we expect that for the foreseeable future  many of our processes will remain manually intensive and thus subject to human error 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition and operations 
we have made strategic acquisitions of businesses  technologies and other assets in the past 
while we have no current agreements or commitments  we may in the future acquire businesses  product lines or technologies 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals  or they may be viewed negatively by customers  financial markets or investors and we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume other liabilities  or incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets and or incur large and immediate write offs 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with our own  diversion of management s attention from our core business  assumption of unknown liabilities  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  increased accounting compliance risk  
table of contents risks associated with entering new markets  and potential loss of key employees 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire in the future 
our failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our use and reliance upon development resources in india  china and canada may expose us to unanticipated costs or liabilities 
we have established development centers in india  china and canada and expect to continue to increase hiring of personnel for these facilities 
there is no assurance that our reliance upon development resources in india  china or canada will enable us to achieve meaningful cost reductions or greater resource efficiency 
further  our development efforts and other operations in these countries involve significant risks  including difficulty hiring and retaining appropriate engineering resources due to intense competition for such resources and resulting wage inflation  the knowledge transfer related to our technology and exposure to misappropriation of intellectual property or confidential information  including information that is proprietary to us  our customers and other third parties  heightened exposure to changes in the economic  security and political conditions of india  china and canada  fluctuation in currency exchange rates and tax risks associated with international operations  and development efforts that do not meet our requirements because of language  cultural or other differences associated with international operations  resulting in errors or delays 
difficulties resulting from the factors above and other risks related to our operations in these countries could expose us to increased expense  impair our development efforts  harm our competitive position and damage our reputation 
unforeseen health  safety and environmental costs could harm our business 
our manufacturing operations use substances that are regulated by various federal  state and international laws governing health  safety and the environment  including the waste electrical and electronic equipment and restriction of the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment regulations adopted by the european union 
if we experience a problem with these substances  it could cause an interruption or delay in our manufacturing operations or could cause us to incur liabilities for any costs related to health  safety or environmental remediation 
we could also be subject to liability if we do not handle these substances in compliance with safety standards for storage and transportation and applicable laws 
if we experience a problem or fail to comply with such safety standards  our business  financial condition and operating results may be harmed 
we are subject to governmental import and export controls that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets 
we are subject to export control laws that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products 
us export control laws also limit our ability to conduct product development activities in certain countries 
in addition  various countries regulate the import of certain technologies and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers ability to implement our products in those countries 
changes in our products or changes in import and export regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets  prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products throughout their global systems or  in some cases  prevent the import and export of our products to certain countries altogether 
any change in import and export regulations or related legislation  shift in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations  or change in the countries  persons or technologies 
table of contents targeted by such regulations  could result in decreased use of our products by  or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to  existing or potential customers with international operations 
failure to comply with these and similar laws on a timely basis  or at all  decreased use of our products or any limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we need additional capital in the future  it may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our business requires significant capital 
we have historically relied on significant outside debt and equity financing as well as cash flow from operations to fund our operations  capital expenditures and expansion 
we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings in the future to fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities 
we have a history of significant operating losses 
for  we had a net loss of million 
in the event that we require additional capital  we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of our company  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us  if and when we require it  our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be limited and our business will be harmed 
we are subject to government regulations that could adversely impact our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire us communications industry and  as a result  our products and our us customers are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc regulations affecting communications services  our products or our customers businesses could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international customers in the future 
moreover  many jurisdictions are evaluating or implementing regulations relating to cyber security  privacy and data protection  which can affect the market and requirements for networking and communications equipment 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders 
further  we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
any failure to obtain such approvals could harm our business and operating results 
natural disasters  terrorist attacks or other catastrophic events could harm our operations 
our headquarters and the majority of our infrastructure  including our pic fabrication manufacturing facility  are located in northern california  an area that is susceptible to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
further  a terrorist attack aimed at northern california or at our nation s energy or telecommunications infrastructure could hinder or delay the development and sale of our products 
in the event that an earthquake  terrorist attack or other catastrophe were to destroy any part of our facilities  or certain of our contract manufacturers facilities  destroy or disrupt vital infrastructure systems or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time  our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
security incidents  such as data breaches and cyber attacks  could compromise our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential information and cause significant damage to our business and reputation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we maintain sensitive data on our networks  including data related to our intellectual property and data related to our business and that of our customers and business partners that is considered proprietary or confidential information 
we believe that companies in the technology industry have been increasingly subject to a wide variety of security incidents  cyber attacks and other attempts to gain unauthorized access 
while the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation  our network and storage applications may be subject to unauthorized access by hackers or breached due to operator error  malfeasance or other system disruptions 
it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such security incidents or data breaches and the damage caused as a result 
accordingly  a data breach  cyber attack  or unauthorized access or disclosure of our information  could compromise our intellectual property and reveal proprietary or confidential business information 
in addition  these security incidents could also cause us to incur 
table of contents significant remediation costs and expenses  disrupt key business operations  subject us to liability and divert attention of management and key information technology resources  any of which could cause significant harm to our business and reputation 
the trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future 
the trading prices of our common stock and the securities of other technology companies have been and may continue to be highly volatile 
further  our common stock has limited prior trading history 
factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include variations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new services or service enhancements  strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors  the gain or loss of customers  recruitment or departure of key personnel  changes in the estimates of our future operating results or external guidance on those results or changes in recommendations by any securities analysts that elect to follow our common stock  market conditions in our industry  the industries of our customers and the economy as a whole  and adoption or modification of regulations  policies  procedures or programs applicable to our business 
in addition  if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences loss of investor confidence  the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business  financial condition or operating results 
the trading price of our common stock might also decline in reaction to events that affect other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us 
each of these factors  among others  could harm the value of your investment in our common stock 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have had securities class action lawsuits filed against them 
if a suit were filed against us  regardless of its merits or outcome  it could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could discourage delay or prevent a change in control of our company and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
we are a delaware corporation and the anti takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law  which apply to us  may discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder  even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders 
in addition  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws authorize the issuance of blank check convertible preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt  establish a classified board of directors  as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election  require that directors only be removed from office for cause and only upon a supermajority stockholder vote  provide that vacancies on the board of directors  including newly created directorships  may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office rather than by stockholders  prevent stockholders from calling special meetings  and prohibit stockholder action by written consent  requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders

the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
background infinera was founded in december with a unique vision for optical networking 
prior to infinera  communications service provider optical networks were built from fairly commoditized products  broadly known as wavelength division multiplexing wdm systems 
recent growth in bandwidth demand has increased the need for the delivery of high capacity low cost bandwidth throughout the network 
we believe that traditional point to point network architectures do not provide the required flexibility to meet this demand 
it takes large amounts of low cost bandwidth  pervasive optical transport network otn switching  and the intelligence of bandwidth management to manage these larger networks and deliver high capacity services quickly and cost effectively 
infinera believes this can best be achieved with photonic integrated circuits pics and that only through photonic integration can network operators efficiently scale their network bandwidth without significant increases in space  power or operational workload 
we first introduced our digital optical network architecture to the market in this architecture is based on our unique pics and enables high capacity  low cost bandwidth in the cloud and distributed switching throughout the network 
since  our strategy has been to extend the benefits of our digital optical network throughout the optical networking market 
we have made significant enhancements to our digital transport node system dtn platform during this time by increasing reach and fiber capacity for the long haul market  adding the infinera mtc  a inch chassis option tailored for the metro core market  and adding a submarine version of the dtn platform for the submarine line terminating equipment market 
in addition  we introduced our atn metro access platform atn platform  extending infinera s digital bandwidth management and intelligent network benefits to the network edge 
traffic patterns in the optical network continue to grow to accommodate increased bandwidth from video  mobility and cloud computing with high capacity networks migrating from gigabits per second gbps and gbps wavelength solutions to newly available gbps solutions 
in order to meet the growing bandwidth demands of our customers  we introduced our gbps non pic based solution in the third quarter of and we launched our dtn x platform  a gbps platform based on our gbps pics with a terabit otn switch in september and completed our first shipments for customer deployment in the second quarter of the dtn  dtn x and atn platforms are designed to operate as a tightly integrated network with a single management system providing an end to end digital optical network experience 

table of contents financial and business performance was an important year for infinera 
we commenced shipment of our next generation dtn x platform in the second quarter with first revenues recognized from the platform in the third quarter 
the dtn x platform has been well received by customers across many markets with purchase commitments received from customers by the end of the year 
while new deployments of high capacity networks are now mostly occurring on the dtn x platform  we continued to sell the dtn platform where appropriate  with nine new dtn platform customers added in dtn x market traction and the resulting growth in revenue contributed to an improvement in our overall financial performance in the second half of we had incurred significant dtn x related manufacturing and research and development expenditures in and early  in advance of generating revenues from the platform 
this resulted in significant losses and cash consumption in those periods 
in the second half of  we experienced improved financial metrics with strong sequential quarterly revenue growth  reduced spending levels and improved income statement performance 
our overall gross margin for was  decreased from in this decrease in gross margins in primarily reflects the impact of early product cycle production costs for the dtn x platform  increased levels of lower margin network footprint sales and competitive pricing pressure 
the industry typically experiences downward pressure on gross margins during network footprint deployments  with higher gross margins achieved as capacity is added to deployed networks 
in  we intend to focus our efforts on leveraging the dtn x platform to win new network footprint and gain market share 
these efforts will be balanced with a focus on product cost improvements and overall prudent financial management 
we believe that with sustained revenue growth  we can leverage our vertically integrated manufacturing model  which combined with selling bandwidth capacity into deployed networks  can result in improved future profitability and cash flow 
future business and industry trends our goal is to be the leading provider of optical networking systems to communications service providers  internet content providers  cable operators  subsea network operators  and others 
our revenue growth will depend on the continued acceptance of our products  growth of communications traffic and the proliferation of next generation bandwidth intensive services  which are expected to drive the need for increased levels of bandwidth 
our ability to increase our revenue and achieve profitability will be directly affected by the level of acceptance of our products in the long haul and metro wdm markets and by our ability to cost effectively develop and sell innovative products that leverage our technology advantages on a time to market basis 
as of december   we have sold our products for deployment in the optical networks of customers worldwide  including colt  cox communications  deutsche telekom  equinix  interoute  kvh  teliasonera  level  ntt  ote  pacnet and xo communications 
we do not have long term sales commitments from our customers 
to date  a few of our customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
no customers accounted for over of our revenue in or one customer accounted for over of our revenue in our business will be harmed if any of our key customers do not generate as much revenue as we forecast  stop purchasing from us  or substantially reduce their orders for our products 
we are headquartered in sunnyvale  california  with employees located throughout the americas  europe  and the asia pacific region 
we expect to continue to add some personnel in the united states and internationally to develop our products and provide additional geographic sales and technical support coverage 
we primarily sell our products through our direct sales force  with a small portion sold indirectly through resellers 
we derived  and of our revenue from direct sales to customers for  and  respectively 
we expect to continue generating a substantial majority of our revenue from direct sales in the future 
our near term year over year and quarter over quarter revenue will likely be volatile and may be impacted by several factors including general economic and market conditions  time to market development of new products  acquisitions of new customers and the timing of large product deployments 

table of contents we will continue to make significant investments in the business  and management currently believes that operating expenses for will range from million to million  including stock based compensation expense of approximately million to million

while this increase in dtn x revenues was somewhat offset by a reduction in sales of our dtn platform  we continued to deploy the dtn platform in lower capacity applications with nine new customers in revenues for were negatively impacted when customers who required higher capacity network solutions in advance of the availability of our gbps and gbps systems purchased competitor products for portions of their networks 
international revenue increased to of total revenue in from of total revenue in the increases were primarily due to an increased proportion of our sales occurring in europe 
while we expect international revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars on a long term basis as we increase our sales activities in europe  asia pacific and other regions  this metric may fluctuate as a percentage of total revenue depending on the size and timing of deployments both internationally and in the united states 
total product revenue increased to million in from million in reflecting increased sales of our dtn x platform in the second half of product and related support services revenue that is recognized ratably includes sales of products and services that were deferred under previous accounting standards  prior to our adoption of asu and asu  because vendor specific objective evidence of fair value had not been established for the undelivered elements 
total ratable revenue levels decreased to million in from million in due to an overall reduction in sales of products and services that were deferred following our adoption of asu and asu we have a limited number of software offerings and related support services that will continue to be accounted for under the software revenue recognition rules

total services revenue increased to million in from million in primarily reflecting the incremental recognition of million related to deployment services revenue  million related to our spares management service revenue  million related to extended warranty service revenue  million of first line management services revenue  million of network management services revenue  and million from training services revenue  offset by a decrease of million related to our software subscription service revenue 
the increase in deployment services in was primarily due to the introduction and deployment of new networks based on our dtn x platform 
in addition  we expect to continue to grow our extended hardware warranty and spares management services revenues in future periods as our installed base continues to grow

as our installed customer base grows  we expect to continue to grow our extended hardware warranty and spares management services revenues in future periods 
cost of revenue and gross margin compared to gross margin decreased to in from in gross margin in reflected the recognition of revenues from the initial sales of our dtn x platform 
these sales represented early production units and as such  had a higher product cost 
the transition of a portion of our revenues from the dtn platform to these lower margin initial dtn x units contributed to a decline in gross margins in the second half of the year 
in addition  costs for the first half of included pre production costs associated with the dtn x platform production ramp 
we also experienced a higher level of lower margin network footprint sales in the second half of  as we began dtn x platform deployments 
competition for new gbps deployments has been strong  which has resulted in a highly competitive pricing environment for new deployments during compared to gross margin decreased to in from in this decrease primarily reflected incremental costs associated with the expansion of our pic fabrication pic fab facility and new product introduction costs related to our next generation products combined with reduced product shipments and the need for increased pricing discounts in order to remain competitive 
see note  restructuring and other related costs  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our restructuring plan under which we closed our maryland based semiconductor fabrication plant maryland fab 
based on our current outlook  we expect downward pressure on gross margins to continue for the next several quarters as we focus on winning new network footprint and gaining market share  while continuing to drive cost reductions on the dtn x platform 
we do not have the visibility necessary to accurately predict quarterly gross margins beyond this time horizon  but believe that increased revenues and improved product mix can allow for some margin expansion later in and in future years

during  and  income tax benefits of zero  million and million for each year were allocated to the tax provision from continuing operations  related to the tax effects of items credited directly to other comprehensive income oci 
generally  the amount of tax expense or benefit allocated to continuing operations is determined without regard to the tax effects of other categories of income or loss  such as oci 
however  an exception to the general rule is provided within the intra period tax allocations rules when there is a pre tax loss from continuing operations and there are items charged or credited to other categories  including oci  in the current year 
the intra period tax allocation rules related to items charged or credited directly to oci can result in disproportionate tax effects that remain in oci until certain events occur

under the tax reform act of  the amount of benefit from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating losses that we may utilize in any one year include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change of more than percent as defined  over a three year testing period 
as of december   we had determined that ownership changes have occurred that would result in limitations on the current and future utilization of its net operating loss carryforwards 
however  based on the work performed  the limitations are not significant enough to impact the future utilization of the tax attributes 
in determining future taxable income  we make assumptions to forecast federal  state and international operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of any feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
the assumptions require significant judgment regarding the forecasts of future taxable income  and are consistent with our income forecasts used to manage our business

this was offset by million related to payments for purchase of assets under a financing arrangement 
liquidity as of december   we held an a rated available for sale ars at million par value with a fair value of million with one issuer 
this ars has a contractual maturity term of up to years and it is not clear when we will be able to liquidate this investment 
in  we determined that the present value of the expected cash flows for this security was below its par value  and recorded an initial other than temporary impairment otti of million  equal to the difference between the fair value and the par value had occurred 
during  million of this ars was called at par value 
failed auctions resulted in a lack of liquidity in the ars  but did not affect the underlying collateral of the security 
we do not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in our ars  even for an extended period of time  will affect our ability to finance our operations  including our continued investments in research and development and planned capital expenditures 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of this investment 
our ars investment is classified as a non current asset until we have better visibility as to when its liquidity will be restored 
for  capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million  primarily for product development 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if these sources of cash are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements beyond months  we may require additional capital from equity or debt financings to fund our operations  to respond to competitive pressures or strategic opportunities  or otherwise 
we may not be able to secure timely additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
the terms of any additional financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity  convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity  our existing stockholders could suffer dilution in their percentage ownership of us  and any new securities we issue could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands purchase obligations operating leases other contracts total contractual obligations 
table of contents we have service agreements with our major production suppliers under which we are committed to purchase certain parts 
we lease facilities under non cancelable operating lease agreements 
these leases have varying terms  predominantly no longer than ten years each and contain leasehold improvement incentives  rent holidays and escalation clauses that range from one to ten years 
in addition  some of these leases have renewal options for up to five years 
we also have contractual commitments to remove leasehold improvements and return certain properties to a specified condition when the leases terminate 
at the inception of a lease with such conditions  we record an asset retirement obligation liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful life of the asset 
an assumption of lease renewal where a renewal option exists is used only when the renewal has been determined to be reasonably assured 
the estimated useful life of leasehold improvements is one to ten years 
other contracts are related to contractual obligations for non recurring engineering costs 
tax liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions are not included in the table because we are unable to determine the timing of settlement if any  of these future payments with a reasonably reliable estimate 
we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of december  these consisted of million related to a value added tax license  million related to a customer proposal guarantee  million related to property leases and million related to foreign payroll 
we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of december  these consisted of million related to a customer proposal guarantee  million related to a value added tax license and million related to property leases 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
significant estimates and assumptions made by management include revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory valuation  allowances for sales reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  accrued warranty  cash equivalents  fair value measurement of investments  other than temporary impairments  derivative instruments and accounting for income taxes 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates and judgments are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
revenue recognition substantially all of our product sales are sold in combination with software support services comprised of either software warranty or software subscription services 
we also periodically sell training  installation and deployment services  spares management and on site hardware replacement services with our product sales 
training services include the right to a specified number of training classes and installation and deployment services may include customer site assessments  equipment installation and testing 
training and installation and deployment services are generally delivered over a day period 
software warranty provides customers with maintenance releases and patches during the warranty support period 
software subscription also includes maintenance releases and patches and provides customers with rights to receive unspecified software product upgrades released during the support period 
these support services are generally delivered over a one year 
table of contents period 
spares management and on site hardware replacement services include the replacement of defective units at customer sites in accordance with specified service level agreements and are generally delivered over a one year period 
we recognize product revenue when all of the following have occurred we have entered into a legally binding arrangement with the customer  delivery has occurred  which is when product title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  customer payment is deemed fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we allocate revenue to each element in our multiple element arrangements based upon their relative selling prices 
we determine the selling price for each deliverable based on a selling price hierarchy 
the selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price esp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria for that element has been met 
vsoe of selling price is used in the selling price allocation in all instances where it exists 
vsoe of selling price for products and services is determined when a substantial majority of the selling prices fall within a reasonable range when sold separately 
in certain instances  we are not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in an arrangement with multiple elements 
this mainly occurs where insufficient standalone sales transactions have occurred or where pricing for that element has not been consistent 
tpe of selling price can be established by evaluating largely interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and the solution offered differs substantially from that of competitors  it is typically difficult to obtain the reliable standalone competitive pricing necessary to establish tpe 
esp represents the best estimate of the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold on a standalone basis 
we determine esp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to customer type  geography  market conditions  competitive landscape  gross margin objectives and pricing practices 
the determination of esp is made through formal approval by our management  taking into consideration the overall go to market pricing strategy 
as our go to market strategies evolve  we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in selling prices  including both vsoe and esp 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ materially from that recorded in the current period 
we regularly review vsoe  tpe  and esp and maintain internal controls over the establishment and update of these inputs 
we limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services  future performance obligations or subject to customer specified return or refund privileges 
we evaluate each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting 
we have a limited number of software offerings which are not required to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality and can be sold separately 
revenue from sales of these software products and related post contract support will continue to be accounted for under software revenue recognition rules 
our multiple element arrangements may therefore have a software deliverable that is subject to the existing software revenue recognition guidance 
the revenue for these multiple element arrangements is allocated to the software deliverable and the non software deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all of the deliverables in the arrangement using the hierarchy in the new revenue recognition accounting guidance 
revenues related to these software offerings are not expected to be significant 
revenue arrangements entered into prior to the first quarter of continue to be accounted for under our previous revenue recognition policy 
services revenue includes software subscription services  training  installation and deployment services  spares management  on site hardware replacement services and extended hardware warranty services 
revenue from 
table of contents software subscription  spares management  on site hardware replacement services and extended hardware warranty contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the contractual support period  which is generally one year 
revenue related to training and installation and deployment services is recognized as the services are completed 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
in addition  shipping documents and customer acceptances  when applicable  are used to verify delivery and transfer of title 
revenue is recognized only when title and risk of loss pass to customers and when revenue recognition criteria has been met 
in instances where acceptance of the product occurs upon formal written acceptance  revenue is deferred until such written acceptance has been received 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
payment terms to customers generally range from net to days from invoice  which are considered to be standard payment terms 
however  payment terms greater than days but less than or equal to one year from invoice may be considered standard if payment is supported by an irrevocable commercial letter of credit loc issued by a creditworthy bank or if the loc has been accepted and confirmed by a creditworthy bank 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ from our standard business practices  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and  therefore  revenue is not recognized until the fees become fixed or determinable which we believe is when they are legally due and payable 
we assess our ability to collect from our customers based primarily on the creditworthiness and past payment history of the customer 
for sales to resellers  the same revenue recognition criteria apply 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a reseller 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection to our resellers 
shipping charges billed to customers are included in product revenue and related shipping costs are included in product cost 
we report revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities  with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period generally the vesting period under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of the stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
for new hire grants  options typically vest with respect to of the shares one year after the option s vesting commencement date and the remainder ratably on a monthly basis over three years  commencing one year after the vesting commencement date 
for annual refresh grants  options typically vest ratably on a monthly basis over three  four or five years 
in  we granted performance based stock options to executives as part of our annual refresh grant process 
the performance based stock options entitle our executive team to receive a number of options to purchase our common stock based on pre established performance criteria over approximately one year 
these performance metrics are classified as performance conditions  and we evaluate the performance status at the end of each period and record the expense when deemed probable 
we make a number of estimates and assumptions in determining stock based compensation related to options including the following the expected forfeiture rate is estimated based on our historical forfeiture data and compensation costs are recognized only for those equity awards expected to vest 
the estimation of the forfeiture rate requires judgment  and to the extent actual forfeitures differ from expectations  changes in estimate will be recorded as an adjustment in the period when such estimates are revised 
actual results may differ substantially from the estimates 
expected volatility of our stock is based on the weighted average implied and historical volatility of infinera and our peer group 
the peer group is comprised of similar companies in the same industrial sector 
as we gain more historical volatility data  the weighting of our own data in the expected volatility calculation associated with options will gradually increase 
we estimate the fair value of the rights to acquire stock under our espp using the black scholes option pricing formula 
our espp typically provides for consecutive six month offering periods and we use our own historical volatility data in the valuation of espp shares 

table of contents we account for the fair value of restricted stock units rsus using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
for new hire grants  rsus typically vest ratably on an annual basis over four years 
for annual refresh grants  rsus typically vest ratably on an annual basis over three  four or five years 
in  we granted retention rsus to executive officers which cliff vest after an approximate two year period 
we grant performance share units psus with market conditions and estimate the fair value of using a monte carlo simulation model 
we granted psus to our executives in as part of our annual refresh grant process 
these psus entitle our executive officers and members of our board of directors to receive a number of shares of our common stock based on our stock price performance over a three year or four year period as compared to the nasdaq composite index nasdaq for the same period 
the psus cliff vest after three or four years and the number of shares to be issued upon vesting ranges from to times the number of psus granted depending on the relative performance of our common stock price compared to nasdaq 
this performance metric is classified as a market condition 
the monte carlo simulation model is based on a discounted cash flow approach  with the simulation of a large number of possible stock price outcomes for our stock and nasdaq 
the use of the monte carlo simulation model requires the input of a number of assumptions including expected volatility of our stock price  expected volatility of nasdaq  correlation between changes in our stock price and changes in nasdaq  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
expected volatility of our stock is based on the weighted average implied and historical volatility of our peer group in the industry in which we do business 
expected volatility of nasdaq is based on the historical and implied data 
correlation is based on the historical relationship between our peer group stock price and nasdaq composite average 
the risk free interest rate is based upon the treasury zero coupon yield appropriate for the term of the psu as of the grant date 
the expected dividend yield is zero for us as we do not expect to pay dividends in the future 
the expected dividend yield for nasdaq is the annual dividend yield expressed as a percentage of the composite average of nasdaq on the grant date 
in  we granted psus with performance conditions and estimated the fair value using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
these psus entitle our executive officers to receive a number of shares of our common stock based on pre established performance criteria over approximately two and a half years 
the psus cliff vest at upon achievement of specific revenue criteria and will cliff vest upon achievement of specific operating profit criteria 
this performance metric is classified as a performance condition 
inventory valuation inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods and are stated at standard cost adjusted to approximate the lower of actual cost first in  first out method or market 
market value is based upon an estimated selling price reduced by the estimated cost of disposal 
the determination of market value involves numerous judgments including estimated average selling prices based upon recent sales volumes  industry trends  existing customer orders  current contract price  future demand and pricing and technological obsolescence of our products 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted demand or is anticipated to be sold at a loss is written down to its estimated net realizable value based on historical usage and expected demand 
as of december  and december   our inventory value had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolescence 
in valuing our deferred inventory costs  we considered whether the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered at less than cost  primarily comprised of common equipment  had declined 
we concluded that  in the instances where the utility of the products delivered or expected to be delivered was less than cost  it was appropriate to value the inventory costs and deferred inventory costs at cost or market  whichever is lower  thereby recognizing the cost of the reduction in utility in the period in which the reduction occurred or can be reasonably estimated 
we have  therefore  recognized inventory write downs as necessary in each period in order to reflect inventory at the lower of cost or market lcm 
as of december  and december   our inventory value had been reduced by million and million  respectively  for lcm adjustments 
we considered whether we should accrue losses on firm purchase commitments related to inventory items 
given that the expected selling price of common equipment in the future remains below cost  we have also 
table of contents recorded losses on these firm purchase commitments in the period in which the commitment is made 
when the inventory parts related to these firm purchase commitments are received  that inventory is recorded at the purchase price less the accrual for the loss on the purchase commitment 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
accounts receivable and allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of trade receivables recorded upon recognition of revenue for product and services revenues  reduced by reserves for estimated bad debts and returns 
trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
credit is extended based on evaluation of the customer s financial condition 
we record our accounts receivable at the invoiced value 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for a portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a review of all significant outstanding invoices 
at december  and december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and zero  respectively 
allowances for sales returns customer product returns are approved on a case by case basis 
specific reserve provisions are made based upon a specific review of all the approved product returns  where the customer has yet to return the products to generate the related sales return credit at the end of a period 
estimated sales returns are provided for as a reduction to revenue in  and these were insignificant for any period presented on our consolidated financial statements 
at december  and december   revenue reserves recorded for potential sales returns were million and million  respectively 
accrued warranty we warrant that our products will operate substantially in conformity with product specifications 
upon delivery of our products  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products or the related components that may be returned under warranty 
our hardware warranty periods range from one to five years from date of acceptance for hardware and days for software warranty 
the hardware warranty accrual is based on actual historical returns experience and the application of those historical return rates to our in warranty installed base 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
we have software warranty support obligations to a small number of our customers and the costs associated with providing these software warranties have been insignificant to our consolidated financial statements to date 
cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments we consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of days or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
marketable securities consist of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agency notes  us treasuries and ars 
we consider all debt instruments with original maturities at the date of purchase greater than days and remaining time to maturity of one year or less to be short term investments 
we classify debt instruments with remaining maturities greater than one year as long term investments  unless we intend to settle our holdings within one year or less and in such case it is considered to be short term investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of our marketable securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
available for sale investments are stated at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we evaluate our available for sale marketable debt securities for other than temporary impairments as discussed below and record any credit 
table of contents loss portion in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
the amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity and for any credit losses incurred on these securities 
gains and losses are recognized when realized in the consolidated statements of operations under the specific identification method 
trading securities investments are stated at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations  consisting of ars trading securities and related put rights 
fair value measurement of investments pursuant to the accounting guidance for fair value measurements and its subsequent updates  fair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
valuation techniques used by us are based upon observable and unobservable inputs 
observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about market participant assumptions based on best information available 
observable inputs are the preferred source of values 
these two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level prices or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable 
we measure our cash equivalents  derivative instruments and debt securities at fair value and classify our securities in accordance with the fair value hierarchy 
our money market funds and us treasuries are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy and are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
we classify our certificates of deposit  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us agency notes and foreign currency exchange forward contracts within level of the fair value hierarchy as follows certificates of deposit we review market pricing and other observable market inputs for the same or similar securities obtained from a number of industry standard data providers 
in the event that a transaction is observed for the same or similar security in the marketplace  the price on that transaction reflects the market price and fair value on that day 
in the absence of any observable market transactions for a particular security  the fair market value at period end would be equal to the par value 
these inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data  and result in the classification of these securities as level of the fair value hierarchy 
commercial paper we review market pricing and other observable market inputs for the same or similar securities obtained from a number of industry standard data providers 
in the event that a transaction is observed for the same or similar security in the marketplace  the price on that transaction reflects the market price and fair value on that day and then follows a revised accretion schedule to determine the fair market value at period end 
in the absence of any observable market transactions for a particular security  the fair market value at period end is derived by accreting from the last observable market price 
these inputs represent quoted prices for similar assets or these inputs have been derived from observable market data accreted mathematically to par  and result in the classification of these securities as level of the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents corporate bonds we review trading activity and pricing for each of the corporate bond securities in its portfolio as of the measurement date and determines if pricing data of sufficient frequency and volume in an active market exists in order to support level classification of these securities 
since sufficient quoted pricing for identical securities is not available  we obtain market pricing and other observable market inputs for similar securities from a number of industry standard data providers 
in instances where multiple prices exist for similar securities  these prices are used as inputs into a distribution curve to determine the fair market value at period end 
as a result  we classify our corporate bonds as level of the fair value hierarchy 
foreign currency exchange forward contracts as discussed in note  derivative instruments  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we mainly hold non speculative foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures 
we estimate the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates 
where applicable  these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves  credit risk  foreign exchange rates  and forward and spot prices for currencies 
as a result  we classify our derivative instruments as level of the fair value hierarchy 
we classify our ars within level of the fair value hierarchy 
our ars are classified within level because they are valued  in part  by using inputs that are unobservable in the market and are significant to the valuation 
these ars represent approximately of our total investment portfolio as of december  uncertainties in the credit markets have affected all of our ars and auctions for these securities have failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
in light of these developments  to determine the fair value for our ars  we used a combination of the market approach and income approach 
the market approach uses pricing based on transactions in an inactive secondary market for similar or comparable securities 
in addition  we performed our own discounted cash flow analysis 
management determined that it was most appropriate to value the ars using the market approach and income approach equally given the facts and circumstances as of december   and therefore incorporated both valuations in our fair value measurement 
the significant unobservable inputs and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of our ars  as of december   are as follows contractual cash flow the model assumed that the principal amount or par value for these securities will be repaid at the end of the estimated workout period 
in addition  future interest payments were estimated as described in each individual prospectus and based on the then current us treasury bill rate adjusted for a failed auction premium of basis points bps 
ars discount rate the model incorporated a discount rate equal to an estimate of the libor rates commensurate with the estimated workout period of the securities 
as of the measurement date  these rates were then adjusted by a factor that ranged from bps  representing an estimate of the market student loan spread and a discount factor to reflect the lack of liquidity and credit risk associated with these securities 
as of december   we held million par value of a rated securities 
our ars are mostly collateralized by student loans guaranteed by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
the discount rate does  however  include a discount factor to reflect the issuer s credit risk and its potential inability to perform its obligations under the terms of the ars agreements 
our valuation analysis indicates that the estimated credit risk element included in the discount rate was bps 
estimated maturity we estimated the workout period of our ars as the weighted average life of the underlying trust loan portfolio where this information was available from servicing and other trust reports 
in a small number of instances where this information was not available  we used the weighted average life of the loan portfolio of a similar trust 
the estimated time to maturity of the securities as of the measurement date was years 

table of contents other than temporary impairments we review our available for sale marketable debt securities on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not a security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
if a debt security s market value is below amortized cost and we either intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before our anticipated recovery  we record an otti charge to earnings for the entire amount of the impairment 
when we do not intend to sell an impaired security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis  we separate the otti into credit and non credit loss portions 
the amount representing the credit loss is recognized in other income expense  net  and the amount related to all other factors is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in determining if a credit loss has occurred  it is our policy to isolate the credit loss related portion of the discount rate used to derive the fair market value of the security and apply this to the expected cash flows in order to determine the portion of the otti that is credit loss related 
this credit related portion of the discount rate is based on the financial condition of the issuer  changes in rating agency credit ratings for the security or increases in credit related yield spreads on similar securities offered by the same issuer 
once a credit impairment loss has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  the amortized cost basis of that available for sale security is reduced by the amount of the credit impairment loss  resulting in a new cost basis for the security 
any non credit related unrealized gains and losses are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
we will continue to monitor the security s credit rating and credit spread and will accrete any reduction in the credit impairment loss to interest income over the expected life of the security 
derivative instruments as discussed in note  derivative instruments  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we mainly hold non speculative foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures 
we estimate the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates 
where applicable  these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market based observable inputs including interest rate curves  credit risk  foreign exchange rates  and forward and spot prices for currencies 
as a result  we classify our derivative instruments as level ii of the fair value hierarchy 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we estimate actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items  such as accruals and allowances not currently deductible for tax purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
in general  deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized 
accordingly  realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions against which these deductions  losses and credits can be utilized within the applicable future periods 
we must assess the likelihood that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the respective jurisdictions  and to the extent we believe that recovery does not meet the more likely than not standard  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december  and december   our domestic net deferred tax assets were fully reserved with a valuation allowance because  based on the available evidence  we believed at that time it was more likely than not 
table of contents that we would not be able to utilize those deferred tax assets in the future 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of the valuation allowance 
we make estimates and judgments about our future taxable income  by jurisdiction  based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans and estimates 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  significant accounting policies  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements including the respective expected dates of adoptions and effects on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk a majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do incur some insignificant operating costs in other currencies 
in addition  certain of our sales contracts are priced in euros and  therefore  a portion of our revenue is subject to foreign currency risks 
our operating expenses and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the india rupee  chinese yuan  british pound and the euro 
the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated transactions as of december  and december  would result in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively for the year then ended 
beginning in the second quarter of  we established a foreign currency risk management program to help protect against the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on accounts receivable denominated in currencies other than our functional currency  which is the us dollar 
as a result  we do not expect a significant impact to our results from a change in exchange rates on foreign denominated accounts receivable balances in the near term 
fluctuations in our currency exchange rates could impact our business in the future 
interest rate sensitivity we had cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and short term and long term restricted cash totaling million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
as of december   we invested in certificates of deposit  money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us treasuries and ars 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for speculative purposes 
we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income 
if overall interest rates fell by in and  our interest income would have declined approximately million and million for such years  assuming consistent investment levels 
as of december  and december   we had no debt outstanding 
auction rate securities as of december   we held an a rated available for sale ars of million par value with a fair value of million with one issuer 
this ars has a contractual maturity term of up to years and it is not clear when we will be able to liquidate this investment 
in  we determined that the present value of the expected cash flows for this security was below its par value  and recorded an initial otti of million  equal to the difference between the fair value and the par value had occurred 
during  million of this a rated ars was called at par value 
failed auctions resulted in a lack of liquidity in the ars but do not affect the underlying collateral of the securities 
we do not anticipate that any potential lack of liquidity in our ars  even for an extended period of time  
table of contents will affect our ability to finance our operations  including our continued investments in research and development and planned capital expenditures 
we continue to monitor efforts by the financial markets to find alternative means for restoring the liquidity of these investments 
our ars investment is classified as a non current asset until we have better visibility as to when its liquidity will be restored
