item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we believe we are the largest manufacturer of private label salad dressings  powdered drink mixes  and instant hot cereals in the united states and canada and the largest manufacturer of non dairy powdered creamer and pickles in the united states  based upon total sales volumes 
in  based on available industry data  private label products sold in the retail grocery channel in the united states  which compete with branded products on the basis of equivalent quality at a lower price  represented approximately of all shelf stable pickle and pepper products  approximately of all non dairy powdered creamer  approximately of all powdered drinks  approximately of all salad dressings and approximately of all canned soup 
we sell our products primarily to the retail grocery and foodservice channels 
for the year ended december   sales to the retail grocery and foodservice channels represented and  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
the remaining represented industrial and export sales 
a majority of our sales are private label products 
we intend to grow our business profitably through the following strategic initiatives expand partnerships with retailers as grocery retailers become more demanding of their private label food product suppliers  they have come to expect strategic insight  product innovation  customer service and logistical economies of scale similar to those of our branded competitors 
to this end  we are continually developing  investing in and expanding our private label food product offerings and capabilities in these areas 
in addition to our low cost manufacturing  we have invested in research and development  product and packaging innovation  category management  information technology systems and other capabilities 
we believe that these investments enable us to provide a broad and growing array of private label food products that generally meet or exceed the value and quality of branded competitors that have comparable sales  marketing  innovation and category management support 
we believe that we are well positioned to expand our market share with grocery retailers given our differentiated capabilities  breadth of product offering and geographic reach 
utilize our scale and innovation to meet customer needs the us retail food industry has continued to bifurcate from traditional food retailers those who carry a full array of refrigerated  frozen and shelf stable products to specialty retailers who cater to consumers who migrate to either end of the value spectrum 
these specialty retailers tend to focus on either value offerings for consumers looking for the maximum value of their food purchases  or catering to consumers looking for the highest quality ingredients  unique packaging or products to satisfy particular dietary needs 
we offer a broad array of innovative products that meet the good  better and best needs of both traditional grocers and specialty retailers 
continue to drive growth and profitability from our existing product portfolio we believe we can continue to drive organic growth from our existing product portfolio 
through insights gained from our economic value added eva analyses  we develop operating strategies that enable us to focus our resources and investments on products and categories that we believe offer the highest potential 
additionally  eva analyses identify products and categories that lag the broader portfolio and require corrective action 
we believe eva analysis is a helpful tool that maximizes the full potential of our product offerings 
leverage cross selling opportunities across customers  sales channels and geographies while we have high private label food product market shares in the united states for our non dairy powdered creamer  soup  salad dressing  powdered drinks  instant hot cereals  and pickles  as well as significant branded and private label food product market share in jams in canada  we believe we still have significant potential for growth with grocery retailers and foodservice distributors that we either 
table of contents currently serve in a limited manner  or do not currently serve 
we believe that certain customers view our size and scale as an advantage over smaller private label food product producers  many of whom provide only a single category or service to a single customer or geography 
our ability to service customers across north america and across a wider spectrum of products and capabilities provides many opportunities for cross selling to customers who seek to reduce the number of private label food product suppliers they utilize 
growth through acquisitions we believe we have the expertise and demonstrated ability to identify and integrate value enhancing acquisitions 
we selectively pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses that we believe are a compelling strategic fit with our existing operations 
each potential acquisition is evaluated for merit utilizing a rigorous analysis that assesses targets for their market attractiveness  intrinsic value and strategic fit 
we believe our acquisitions have been successful and consistent with our strategy 
since we began operating as an independent company in  our acquisitions have significantly added to our revenue base  enhanced margins and allowed us to expand from an initial base of two center of store  shelf stable food categories to more than ten 
we attempt to maintain conservative financial policies when pursuing acquisitions and our proven integration strategies have resulted in rapid deleveraging 
by identifying targets that fit within our defined strategies  we believe we can continue to expand our product selection and continue our efforts to be the low cost  high quality and innovative supplier of private label food products for our customers 
the acquisition market in was relatively quiet  as sellers were generally waiting for an opportunity to sell when conditions improved 
this resulted in a higher level of bolt on or tuck in acquisitions of smaller entities 
for example  we acquired substantially all of the assets of naturally fresh for approximately million  and the aseptic cheese and pudding business of associated milk producers  inc ampi for million 
these two deals are substantially smaller in size compared to the larger acquisitions we completed in the past 
however  in the later part of  we saw increased activity in the merger and acquisition market  which leads us to believe that the deal market is recovering 
the following discussion and analysis presents the factors that had a material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations for the years ended december   and this should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements for a discussion of the uncertainties  risks and assumptions associated with these statements 
during  the food industry experienced declining food volumes  shifting consumer behaviors and volatility in the cost of commodities 
the company believes that overall food volumes decreased due in part to less consumer generated waste 
we believe consumers are generating less waste and consequently  reducing food volumes by using a higher percentage of their purchases by eating more leftovers or preparing smaller meals that produce less waste 
additionally  we believe that due to these difficult economic times  consumers have also de loaded their pantry stock 
these factors appear  in our view  to be the main drivers of the reduced overall volumes 
we expect that over the long term  volumes will stabilize and return to rates consistent with population growth 
while the food industry has experienced a year over year decline in food volume  we have been able to maintain relatively flat retail volumes  showing that we have been able to navigate these tough times 
given the reduced industry volume  there appears to be excess capacity in certain categories  which has resulted in certain companies  including treehouse  to enter into restructuring programs and reduce capacity 
for example  we have reduced capacity in recent years in the pickle and soup categories  and will continue to assess our business as the market and industry change 
also impacting the industry and specifically the company is the shift in consumer behavior and their shopping destinations 
traditional grocers and mass merchants have seen their foot traffic and volumes subside throughout the year  while alternate retail channels  such as limited assortment and discount stores have experienced 
table of contents increases 
in  we realigned our sales force to the various retail channels in anticipation of the changes in the retail landscape 
in addition  we are continuously focused on lowering our cost to serve and we have developed new formulations  packaging  and sizes to meet customer and consumer needs 
during the year  the food industry and the company experienced volatility in energy and commodity prices as the impact of drought and global conflicts were reflected in their respective prices 
however  due to our purchasing programs  the company was largely unaffected by these issues in the company expects that commodity prices will continue to be volatile with an overall upward trend 
despite the challenges already discussed  we had great success with the launch of our single serve filtered coffee products  where customer feedback has been positive 
our goal is to be the industry leader in premium private label single serve filtered coffee products 
in addition to this investment  we also completed acquisitions  in which the naturally fresh acquisition helped create a refrigerated manufacturing network that allows us to serve customers from coast to coast 
the company s exposure to foreign exchange rates is primarily limited to the canadian dollar 
for the year  the company had a foreign currency loss of million due to fluctuations between the us and canadian currency exchange rates 
the company completed its annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets as of december  and did not have any impairments 
recent developments in the fall of  the company launched its single serve filtered coffee product 
while the impact of this product launch was not materially significant in  the company expects to become the private label leader in the single serve filtered coffee category 
on august   following a strategic review of the soup category and its related business  the company announced a restructuring plan that includes the closure of its mendota  illinois soup plant 
subsequently  the company amended the plan to include reductions to the cost structure of the pittsburgh  pennsylvania facility by reorganizing and simplifying the soup business at the pittsburgh facility 
the restructuring is expected to reduce manufacturing costs by streamlining operations and moving production from the mendota plant to the company s pittsburgh  pennsylvania soup plant 
production at the mendota facility was primarily related to the north american retail grocery segment and ended as of december   with full plant closure to occur in the first quarter of total restructuring costs are expected to be approximately million  which decreased from million as reported in the third quarter of  as a result of refined estimates 
components of the expected costs include non cash accelerated depreciation of approximately million  severance and outplacement costs of approximately million  and other closure costs of approximately million 
the company will also close its salad dressing plant in seaforth  ontario  canada and transfer production to facilities where the company has lower production costs 
production at the seaforth  ontario facility is expected to end in the second quarter of  with full plant closure expected in the third quarter of total costs to close the seaforth facility are expected to be approximately million  which decreased from million as reported in the third quarter of  as a result of refined estimates 
components of the charges include non cash accelerated depreciation of approximately million  severance of approximately million  and other closure costs of approximately million 
concurrent with the restructurings noted above  the company reviewed the fixed assets for impairment at the product category level and no impairment was indicated 
during the review  the useful lives of the related assets were reassessed and shortened to be consistent with the dates that production at the facilities were expected to 
table of contents end 
the change in estimated useful lives related to the restructurings resulted in million of accelerated depreciation in we expect to incur an additional million of accelerated depreciation through the second quarter of on april   the company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of naturally fresh  inc naturally fresh  a privately owned atlanta  georgia based manufacturer of refrigerated dressings  sauces  marinades  dips and specialty items sold within each of our segments 
the company paid a purchase price of approximately million for the business  net of cash 
the acquisition was financed through borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility 
the acquisition expanded the company s refrigerated manufacturing and packaging capabilities  broadened its distribution footprint and further developed its presence within the growing category of fresh foods 
naturally fresh s atlanta facility  coupled with the company s existing west coast and chicago based refrigerated food plants  is expected to allow the company to more efficiently service customers from coast to coast 
on january   the company repaid its cross border intercompany loans with its canadian subsidiary  ed smith 
the repayment totaled million and included both principal and interest 
payment was financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the loans were fully repaid and canceled at the time of payment 
during  the cash was held by ed smith in short term investments as cash and cash equivalents 
we expect to use the cash for general corporate purposes in canada  including capital projects and acquisitions 
the cash relates to foreign earnings that  if repatriated  would result in a tax liability

we experienced increases in costs of most raw materials in compared to  specifically  soybean oil and corn sweeteners 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in packaging costs  specifically plastics 
we expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall upward trend 
we manage the impact of cost increases  wherever possible  on commercially reasonable terms  by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements 
in addition  we offset the effect of increased costs by raising prices to our customers

the us retail food industry has continued to bifurcate from traditional food retailers those who carry a full array of refrigerated  frozen and shelf stable products to specialty retailers who cater to consumers who migrate to either end of the value spectrum 
these specialty retailers tend to focus on either value offerings for consumers looking for the maximum value of their food purchases  or catering to consumers looking for the highest quality ingredients  unique packaging or products to satisfy particular dietary needs 
this changing behavior has prompted us to develop new formulations  packaging  and sizes to meet customer and consumer needs 
over the past year  we have seen double digit growth in limited assortment and discount store volumes and we expect this trend to continue  but at a much lower rate 
as economic conditions improve  however  we believe this trend will level off 
competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years resulting in mass merchandiser and non traditional grocers  such as those offering a limited assortment  to gain market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing 
table of contents customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industry continues  we could lose sales and profits if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold or if limited assortment stores reduce the variety of products that we sell 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment in the retail and foodservice channels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
consistent with our strategy  our future growth depends  in part  on our ability to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates 
there has been a consolidation trend in the food manufacturing industry and competition for acquisition candidates continues to intensify 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future

if additional borrowings are needed  approximately million was available on the revolving credit facility as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our revolving credit facility

the company believes it has sufficient liquidity with the funds available under the revolving credit facility and does not anticipate a significant risk to cash flows in the foreseeable future as the company operates in a relatively stable industry and has sizable market share across its product lines 
the company s long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity

as a temporary measure  the company established a series of short term intercompany loans from the canadian operations to the us the cash was used to pay down the company s revolving line of credit and reduce the overall interest expense of the consolidated group

the loans were fully repaid and canceled at the time of payment 
during  the cash was held by our canadian subsidiary  ed smith  in short term investments as cash and cash equivalents  and will be used for general corporate purposes in canada  including capital projects and acquisitions 
repayment of the intercompany loans did not impact the company s compliance with loan covenants and did not significantly impact the company s access to liquidity 
seasonality the company s short term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital during the year 
as the company continues to add new product categories to our portfolio  spikes in financing needs are lessened 
vegetable and fruit production are driven by harvest cycles  which occur primarily during the spring and summer as inventories of pickles and jams generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall  increasing our working capital requirements

table of contents critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles gaap with no need for the application of our judgment 
in certain circumstances  however  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable allowances we maintain an allowance for customer promotional programs  marketing co op programs and other sales and marketing expenses 
this allowance is based on a combination of historical rolling twelve month average program activity and historical customer sales  and can fluctuate due to the level of sales and marketing programs  and timing of deductions 
this allowance was million and million  at december  and  respectively 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
pickle inventories are valued using the last in  first out lifo method  while all of our other inventories are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
these valuations have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and defective products and packaging materials 
the estimated allowance is based on a review of inventories on hand compared to estimates of future demand  changes in formulas and packaging materials and inferior product 
the company s allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets totaled  million as of december   resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including but not limited to trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and indefinite lived trademarks are not amortized 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing goodwill has been allocated to  and our reporting units are defined as  north american retail grocery us million of goodwill  north american retail grocery canada million of goodwill  food away from home us million of goodwill  food away from home canada million of goodwill  industrial us million of goodwill  contract us no goodwill and contract canada no goodwill 
the company s reporting units are based on the components one level below our operating and reportable segments 
no components have been aggregated 
we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently  if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill impairment is indicated if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
the company completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis as of december  our assessment did not result in an impairment 
we have seven reporting units  five of which contain goodwill 
table of contents totaling  million 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied  with the weighted average of all discount rates approximating the total company discount rate 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
of the five reporting units with goodwill  all have fair values significantly in excess of their carrying values between and 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
we reviewed our indefinite lived intangible assets  which include our trademarks totaling million  using the relief from royalty method 
significant assumptions include the royalty  growth and discount rates 
our assumptions were based on historical performance and management estimates of future performance  as well as available data on licenses of similar products 
our analysis resulted in no impairment 
the company s policy is that indefinite lived assets must have a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
when these criteria are no longer met  the company changes the classification 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
our analysis resulted in fair values that are in excess of the asset s carrying value by to 
changes in our estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
amortizable intangible assets  which primarily include customer relationships and trademarks  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 
no impairment was identified and the company concluded no changes are necessary to the remaining useful lives or values of the remaining amortizable intangible assets as of december  purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the purchase price of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price of the acquired company over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on an evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations  such differences would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including quoted market prices  forecasted future cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which would have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 

table of contents stock based compensation income before income taxes  for the years ended december  and december   included share based compensation expense for employees and directors of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock unit awards and performance units the awards is determined on the date of grant 
stock options are valued using a black scholes model 
performance units and all other restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards are valued using the closing price of the company s stock on the date of grant 
stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded  could have been impacted  if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of the company s stock price 
the company has estimated that certain employees will complete the required service conditions associated with the awards 
for all other employees  the company estimates forfeitures as not all employees are expected to complete the required service conditions 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the stock options is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
as the company does not have significant history to determine the expected term of its stock option awards  we based the expected term on that of comparable companies 
the assumptions used to calculate the stock option and restricted stock awards granted in are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers having high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors that contemplate a number of variables  including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by gaap  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends  when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by gaap  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
our current asset mix guidelines  under our investment policy as written by our investment committee the investment committee  target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is 
while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  gaap require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our 
table of contents discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of at december  if the discount rate was one percent higher  the pension plan liability would have been approximately lower  or million  as of december  if the discount rate was one percent lower  the pension plan liability would have been approximately higher  or million  as of december  see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our employee pension and retirement benefit plans 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments  other than our commodity agreements as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates which includes libor and prime interest rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance of million under our revolving credit facility as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
the company entered into a million long term interest rate swap agreement with an effective date of november  to lock into a fixed libor interest rate base 
under the terms of the agreement  million in floating rate debt was swapped for a fixed interest base rate for a period of months  amortizing to million for an additional nine months at the same interest rate 
this swap agreement expired august  in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million in senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to the consolidated statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of the senior notes  which mature in september input costs the costs of raw materials  packaging materials  fuel and energy have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
we experienced increases in costs of most raw materials in compared to  specifically in soybean oil and corn sweeteners 
these cost increases were partially offset by decreases in packaging costs  specifically plastics 
we expect the volatile nature of these costs to continue with an overall upward trend 
we use a significant amount of fruits and vegetables in our operations as raw materials 
certain of these fruits and vegetables are purchased under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the 
table of contents crop in that area 
if we are unable to buy the fruits and vegetables from local suppliers  we would purchase them from more distant locations  including other locations within the united states  mexico or india  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  in instances of declining input costs  customers may be looking for price reductions in situations where we have locked into pricing at higher costs
