as a result  all consolidated comparisons below reflect the continuing results of our operations 
income from discontinued operations was million  including a gain on disposal of million  for the year ended december  for additional information  see note  discontinued operations  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  income taxes we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
for the tax year ended december   our subsidiaries were not able to participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
beginning in  we reconsolidated our subsidiaries for federal tax purposes 
we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the history of operating losses and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
during  we reversed million of the valuation allowance  and such reversal was recorded as a benefit in our income tax expenses 
each of the deferred tax assets was evaluated based on our evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize the deferred tax asset  including considering their associated character and jurisdiction 
the decision to reverse a large portion of the valuation allowance was based on our evaluation of all positive and negative evidence 
a cumulative loss position  such as we had for the previous three year period ended december   is generally considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset 
however  significant positive evidence had developed which overcame this negative evidence such that  during the year ended december   management determined that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
this determination was made not based upon a single event or occurrence  but based upon the accumulation of all positive and negative evidence including recent trends in our earnings and taxable income 
other positive evidence included the projection of future taxable income based on a recent history of positive earnings at capitalsource bank  improved asset performance trends  substantial decline in the parent company operations and assets  and one time losses included in the three year cumulative pre tax loss ie  debt extinguishment loss 
additionally  we are no longer in a cumulative pre tax loss position at the end of a valuation allowance of million remains in effect as of december  with respect to deferred tax assets where we believe sufficient evidence does not exist at this time to support a reduction in the allowance 
it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets subject to a valuation allowance will not be realized primarily due to their character and or the expiration of the carryforward periods 
vs 
consolidated income tax benefit for the year ended december  was million  compared to an income tax expense of million for the year ended december   due to adjustments to our deferred tax asset 
the income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the release of valuation allowance in june vs 
consolidated income tax expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax expense for the year ended december  was primarily due to the decrease in the net deferred tax assets of one of our corporate entities

credit quality and allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
several examples of such requirements are the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  various real estate appraisal and other third party reports standards  and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered  including the use of interest reserves 
for additional information  see credit risk management within this section 
real estate construction loans in prior years  real estate construction loans comprised a greater portion of our loan portfolio 
at december   real estate construction loans were million  or of total loans 
by comparison  at the end of  real estate construction loans were billion  or of total loans 
we have reduced our real estate construction lending activity because we consider real estate construction loans to be a higher risk loan type  and because of our view that these loans are higher risk  we are providing additional disclosure of the policies and procedures related to our real estate construction loan portfolio 
the objective of our servicing procedures for real estate construction loans is to maintain the proper relationship between the loan amount funded and the value of the collateral securing the loan 
the primary servicing tasks include  but are not limited to monitoring construction of the project to evaluate the work in place  quality of construction compliance with plans and specifications and adequacy of the budget to complete the project 
we generally use a third party consultant for this evaluation  but also maintain frequent contact with the borrower to obtain updates on the project 
monitoring  where applicable  the leasing or unit sales activity compared to market leasing or market unit sales and compared to the underwritten leasing or unit sales actively 
monitoring compliance with the terms and conditions of the loan agreement  which contains important construction and leasing provisions 
reviewing and approving advance requests per the loan agreement which establishes the frequency  conditions and process for making advances 
typically  each loan advance is conditioned upon funding only for work in place  certification by the construction consultant  and sufficient funds remaining in the loan budget to complete the project 
most of our of real estate construction loans include an interest reserve that is established upon origination of the loan 
we recognize interest income from the reserve during the construction period as long as the interest is deemed collectible 
our risk assessment policies and procedures require that the assignment of a risk rating consider whether the capitalization of interest may be masking other performance related issues 
we consider the status of the construction project securing our loan  including its leasing or sales activity where applicable  relative to our expectations for the status of the project during our initial underwriting 
the adequacy of the interest reserve generally is evaluated each time a risk rating conclusion is required or rendered with particular attention paid to the underlying value of the collateral and its ongoing support of the transaction 
in considering the performing status of a real estate construction loan  the current payment of interest  whether in cash or through an interest reserve  is only one of the factors used in our analysis 
our impairment analysis generally considers the loan maturity  the likelihood of a restructuring of the loan and if that restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  whether the borrower is current on interest and principal payments  the condition of underlying assets and the ability of the borrower to refinance the loan at market terms 
although an interest reserve may mitigate a delinquency that could cause impairment  other issues with the loan or borrower like the project progress compared to underwriting and the market in which the project is located may lead to an impairment determination 
impairment is then measured based on a fair market or discounted cash flow value to assess the current value of the loan relative to the principal balance 
if the valuation analysis indicates that repayment in full is doubtful  the loan will be placed on non accrual status and designated as non performing 
obtaining updated third party valuations is considered when significant negative variances to expected performance exist 
generally  our policy on updating appraisals is to obtain current appraisals subsequent to the impairment date if there are significant changes to the market conditions for the underlying assumptions from the most recent appraisal 
some factors that could cause significant changes include the passage of more than twelve months since the time of the last appraisal  the volatility of the local market  the availability of financing  the number of competing properties  new improvements to or lack of maintenance of the subject property or competing surrounding properties  a change in zoning  environmental contamination  or failure of the project to meet material assumptions of the original appraisal 
the following table presents the balance of non performing real estate construction loans and the cumulative capitalized interest on our real estate construction loan portfolio as of the date of the balance sheet december  in thousands  except percentages total real estate construction loans non performing of total real estate construction cumulative capitalized interest as of december   of the loans that comprise our real estate construction portfolio have been extended  renewed or restructured since origination 
these modifications have occurred for various reasons including  but not limited to  changes in business plans and or work out efforts that were best achieved via a restructuring 
we recognized interest income on the real estate construction loan portfolio of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
excludes deferred loan fees and discounts of million and million as of december  and  respectively

excludes loans held for sale at lower cost or fair value 
the decrease in the non performing loan balance from december  to december  is primarily due to payoffs  charge offs  sales and foreclosures on those loans 
additionally  certain loans within our portfolio have been identified as potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are not considered non performing loans  as disclosed in the table above  or loans that have been restructured in a tdr  but loans where management is aware of information regarding potential credit problems of a borrower that leads to serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the loan repayment terms 
such credit problems could eventually result in the loans being reclassified as non performing loans 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in potential problem loans related to six and eleven  loans respectively  for which we have determined that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreements  but we have concluded that repayment in full of the loans is fully supported by existing collateral or an enterprise valuation of the borrower in accordance with our most recent valuation analysis

as of december   the unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans was billion  and the associated general reserves were million  representing an effective general reserve percentage of 
the effective general reserve percentage was lower at december  than the prior year because the loan portfolio had more favorable credit performance attributes such as the following the level at which loans were becoming newly impaired during was lower than during  a greater portion of non impaired loans were originated within the capitalsource bank segment  and capitalsource bank loan originations have performed better than those originated in   and  certain loan types where we had experienced a disproportionately high degree of historical charge offs comprise a substantially lower amount of the non impaired loans at the end of  and the real estate loans in place at december  were predominately originated after and have performed substantially better than those originated in   and impaired loans we employ a quarterly process to both identify impaired loans and record appropriate specific reserves based on available collateral and other borrower specific information 
we consider a loan to be impaired when  based on current information  we determine that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the original loan agreement 
in this regard  impaired loans include those loans where we expect to encounter a significant delay in the collection of  and or shortfall in the amount of contractual payments due to us as well as loans that we have assessed as impaired  but for which we ultimately expect to collect all payments 
each quarter  we determine each impaired loan fair value 
the fair value is either i the present value of payments expected to be received discounted at the loan effective interest rate  ii the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans  or iii  the impaired loan observable market price 
each impaired loan fair value is compared to the recorded investment in the impaired loan 
if a shortfall exists  a specific reserve is established 
the specific reserves in place at each period end are directly related to the population of impaired loans in place at each period end

troubled debt restructurings during the years ended december  and  loans with an aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively  as of their respective restructuring dates  were involved in tdrs 
loans involved in these tdrs are considered impaired  generally for a period of at least one year following the restructuring  assuming the loan performs under the restructured terms and the restructured terms were at market 
there were million and million of specific reserves allocated to loans that were involved in tdrs as of december  and  respectively 
certain tdrs are the product of a workout strategy involving an a note b note structure  in which the b note component is fully charged off 
this workout strategy results in an a note equaling a balance the borrower can service and is underwritten to a loan to value ratio based on the current collateral valuation 
the a note may be assigned an internal risk rating of pass based on the revised terms and management assessment of the borrower ability and intent to repay 
the a note is structured at a market interest rate  and the a note debt service is typically covered by the in place property operations allowing it to be placed on accrual status 
the reduced loan amount induces the borrower to continue to support the loan and maintain the collateral despite the observed reduction in the collateral value 
the b note usually bears no interest or an interest rate significantly below the market rate 
the a note contains amortization provisions  and the b note requires amortization only after the full repayment of the a note 
accrual status for each loan  including restructured a notes  is considered on a loan by loan basis 
the newly established principal balance of the a note is set at a level where the borrower is expected to keep the loan current and where the underlying collateral value adequately supports the loan 
the revised structure is intended to allow the a loan to be placed on accrual status 
all loans that have undergone this a note b note restructuring are considered tdrs 
the a notes are deemed impaired and remain so classified for at least one year from the date of the restructuring 
after one year  the a notes are evaluated quarterly to determine if the loan performance has complied with the terms of the tdr such that the impairment classification may be removed 
during  capitalsource bank restructured  in tdrs  three commercial real estate loans into new loans using an a note b note structure in which the b note component was fully charged off 
the contractual principal balances of these three loans prior to the restructurings totaled million

we had no potential problem loans as of december  and delinquent loans the following table presents the balance of the non accrual and accruing loans that are delinquent as of the date of the balance sheet december  in thousands non accrual loans days delinquent days delinquent total delinquent non accrual loans accruing loans days delinquent days delinquent total delinquent accruing loans allowance for loan and lease losses the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the years ended december   and was as follows year ended december  in thousands balance as of beginning of year charge offs commercial real estate real estate construction total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate real estate construction total recoveries net charge offs charge offs upon transfer to held for sale deconsolidation of a term debt securitization provision for loan and lease losses general specific total provision for loan and lease losses balance as of end of year allowance for loan and lease losses ratio provision for loan and lease losses as a percentage of average loans outstanding net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding our allowance for loan and lease losses decreased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  this decrease comprised a million decrease in general reserves and a million decrease in specific reserves on impaired loans as further described below 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans was million  and the associated general reserves were million  representing an effective general reserve percentage of 
as of december   the unpaid principal balance of non impaired loans was million  and the associated general reserves were million  representing an effective general reserve percentage of 
the effective general reserve percentage was lower at december  than the prior year end because the loan portfolio had more favorable credit performance attributes 
specifically  between december  and there was a decline in the balance of certain non impaired commercial loans categories with poor credit performance that carried disproportionately higher general reserves 
the balances of these loans declined due to pay offs or by becoming impaired and becoming subject to a specific reserve evaluation 
impaired loans we employ a formal quarterly process to both identify impaired loans and record specific reserves in accordance with the company policy 
for additional information  see credit quality and allowance for loan and lease losses consolidated within this section 
as of december  and  our non impaired and impaired loan balances was as follows december  in thousands non impaired loans unpaid principal balance general reserves allocated effective reserve impaired loans unpaid principal balance specific reserves allocated original legal balance previously charged off total cumulative charge offs and specific reserves legal balance expected total loss of the legal balance the decrease in specific reserves from december  to december  stems from the net effect of i loan resolutions of impaired loans with existing specific reserves of million  ii reversals of specific reserves for loans impaired as of december  net of related reversals or charge offs of million  and iii new specific reserves net of related charge offs for loans new to impairment status during the year ended december  for million 
the specific reserves in place at december  and at december  reduce the carrying values of our impaired loans to the amounts we expect to collect 
the original legal balance of that portfolio had been previously charged off as collection was deemed remote for portions of these loans 
in the other commercial finance portfolio  the areas with more credit risk than others are those that have comprised a greater degree of our historical charge offs 
for the years ended december  and  commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank july inception comprised and  respectively  of those years charge offs 
as such  we believe commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank july inception have a higher degree of credit risk than other lending products in our portfolio 
as of december  and  commercial real estate loans  excluding healthcare real estate loans  originated prior to the bank july inception totaled million and million  respectively  or and of total loans  respectively 
additionally  cash flow based commercial loans originated prior to the bank july inception are considered to be higher risk based on historical charge offs 
for the years ended december  and  cash flow based commercial loans originated prior to the bank july inception comprised and  respectively  of those years charge offs 
as of december  and  cash flow based commercial loans originated prior to the bank july inception totaled million and million  respectively  or and of total loans  respectively 
troubled debt restructurings during the years ended december  and  loans with an aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively  as of their respective restructuring dates  were involved in tdrs 
additionally  loans involved in these tdrs are assessed as impaired  generally for a period of at least one year following the restructuring  assuming the loan performs under the restructured terms and the restructured terms were at market 
the specific reserves allocated to loans that were involved in tdrs were million and million as of december  and  respectively

due to their nature  we cannot know with certainty the aggregate amounts we will be required to fund under these unfunded commitments 
in many cases  our obligation to fund unfunded commitments is subject to our clients ability to provide collateral to secure the requested additional fundings  the collateral satisfaction of eligibility requirements  our clients ability to meet specified preconditions to borrowing  including compliance with the loan agreements  and or our discretion pursuant to the terms of the loan agreements 
in other cases  however  there are no such prerequisites or discretion to future fundings by us  and our clients may draw on these unfunded commitments at any time 
we forecast adequate liquidity to fund the expected borrower draws under these commitments

the use of these special purpose entities is generally required in connection with our non recourse secured term debt financings to legally isolate from us loans that we transfer to these entities if we were to enter into a bankruptcy proceeding 
we evaluate all spes with which we are affiliated to determine whether such entities must be consolidated for financial statement purposes 
if we determine that such entities represent variable interest entities  we consolidate these entities if we also determine that we are the primary beneficiary of the entity 
for special purpose entities for which we determine we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for our economic interests in these entities in accordance with the nature of our investments

as of december  and  we had issued million and million  respectively  in letters of credit which expire at various dates over the next five years 
if a borrower defaults on its commitment s subject to any letter of credit issued under these arrangements  we would be responsible to meet the borrower financial obligation and would seek repayment of that financial obligation from the borrower 
we also provide standby letters of credit under certain of our property leases 
in connection with certain securitization transactions  we have made customary representations and warranties regarding the characteristics of the underlying transferred assets and collateral 
prior to any securitization transaction  we generally performed due diligence with respect to the assets to be included in the securitization transaction and the collateral to ensure that they satisfy the representations and warranties 
in our capacity as originator and servicer in certain securitization transactions  we may be required to repurchase or substitute loans which breach a representation and warranty as of their date of transfer to the securitization or financing vehicle

contractual obligations on our term debt securitizations are computed based on their estimated lives 
the estimated lives are based upon the contractual amortization schedule of the underlying loans 
these underlying loans are subject to prepayment  which could shorten the life of the term debt securitizations  conversely  the underlying loans may be amended to extend their term  which may lengthen the life of the term debt securitizations 
at our option  we may substitute loans for prepaid loans up to specified limitations  which may also impact the life of the term debt securitizations 
the contractual obligations for subordinated debt are computed based on the legal maturities  which are between and includes operating leases and non cancelable contracts 
we enter into derivative contracts under which we either receive cash or are required to pay cash to counterparties depending on changes in interest rates 
derivative contracts are carried at fair value on our audited consolidated balance sheet as of december   with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts change daily as market interest rates change 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in note  summary of significant accounting policies and note  derivative instruments  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  enterprise risk management we take an enterprise wide approach to risk management designed to support our organizational and strategic objectives and to enhance shareholder value 
global risk oversight is conducted by senior management and overseen by the board of directors 
as part of its oversight responsibilities  the board monitors how management operates the company and manages strategic  credit  liquidity  financial  market  regulatory  compliance  legal  fraud  reputation  compensation and operational risks 
the involvement of the full board in setting our business strategy is a fundamental part of its assessment and oversight of appropriate risk tolerances for the company 
board level risk oversight while the full board of directors is responsible for risk oversight  the risk committee  the audit committee  the asset liability committee and the compensation committee and the bank credit policy committee provide direct oversight of risks arising from specific activities 
during  the board of directors established a board level risk committee 
the risk committee monitors the organization compliance with the board approved risk appetite statement and risk tolerance threshold as well as the organization ongoing and potential exposure to other risks 
additionally  the risk committee oversees and approves company wide risk management practices that assist the board in overseeing the executive team identification and assessment of significant risks that the organization faces and establishment of a risk management infrastructure capable of addressing those risks  overseeing and reviewing the risk related responsibilities allocated among board committees  while reviewing management gap analysis no less than annually to determine management appropriate oversight of strategic  financial  credit  market  liquidity  security  property  it  legal  regulatory  compliance  reputational and other emerging risks  and approving the company enterprise wide risk management framework 
in carrying out its duties and responsibilities  the risk committee has the authority to meet with and seek any information it requires from employees  officers  directors  or external parties 
as part of the board risk oversight responsibility  it reviews management capital and liquidity stress tests to evaluate possible outcomes in the event of adverse economic or market events 
these stress tests have become a regular part of the company risk management and capital planning process 
the audit committee oversees financial and accounting risk  including internal controls 
the audit committee receives periodic risk assessment reports from our internal audit department assessing the primary accounting and financial risks facing capitalsource and management considerations for mitigating these risks 
the audit committee also assesses the guidelines and policies that govern the processes for identifying and assessing significant financial and accounting risks and formulating and implementing steps to minimize such risks and exposures 
the audit committee considers risks in the financial reporting and disclosure process and review policies on financial risk control assessment and accounting risk exposure 
the audit committee meets with management  including our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  our internal audit department and our independent registered public accounting firm in executive sessions at least quarterly  and with our general counsel as necessary from time to time 
the audit committee also supervises the internal audit function  which provides the audit committee with periodic assessments of our risk management processes and internal quality control procedures 
the audit committee periodically reviews our internal audit department  including its independence and reporting authority and obligations and the development and coordination of proposed audit plans for coming years 
the audit committee receives notification of material adverse findings from internal audits and a progress report at least quarterly on the proposed internal audit plan  as appropriate  with explanations for changes from the original plan 
the audit committee reviews with management and the independent audit department the adequacy of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and the resolution of any identified material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in such internal control structure and procedures 
the asset liability committee meets periodically but no less frequently than quarterly and assists the board in overseeing and reviewing our asset and liability strategies  including the significant policies  procedures and practices employed to manage these risks 
the asset liability committee periodically reviews our liquidity and cash management 
the compensation committee monitors all of our compensation policies and practices  including our incentive compensation policies and practices  to ensure they are consistent with the company business strategies and in compliance with applicable laws and regulatory guidance 
management regularly assesses our compensation policies and practices to identify and mitigate compensation related risks as appropriate 
the capitalsource bank credit policy committee primarily oversees credit policy and credit risk management 
the credit policy committee of capitalsource bank regularly assesses the effectiveness of credit policies and administration  reviews the methodology for determining the appropriate amount of allowance for loan losses  and monitors the performance of the credit portfolio 
management level risk oversight while the board has ultimate oversight responsibility for our risk management  we have utilized management level committees to actively assess and manage risks across the company 
the board has established an enterprise wide management level enterprise risk management erm infrastructure that aligns with bank regulatory guidance 
the erm infrastructure is governed by a board approved erm policy and plan and administered by a management erm committee ermc chaired by our chief compliance officer 
the ermc comprises executive and senior level management and reports to the board risk committee on enterprise wide risks and risk management 
the ermc is responsible for implementing risk identification  assessment and monitoring systems  where applicable  and has oversight responsibility for the processes that identify  measure  mitigate and report on the company risk categories  including strategic  credit  liquidity  financial  market  regulatory compliance  legal  fraud  reputation  compensation and operational risks 
credit risk management credit risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in a client or counterparty ability to meet its financial obligations under agreed upon terms 
credit risk exists primarily in our loan  lease and derivative portfolios and certain portions of our investment portfolio that may include investments such as non agency mbs  non agency abs  cmbs and collateralized loan obligations 
the degree of credit risk will vary based on many factors including the size of the asset or transaction  the credit characteristics of the client  the contractual terms of the agreement and the availability and quality of collateral 
we manage credit risk of our derivatives and credit related arrangements by limiting the total amount of arrangements outstanding with an individual counterparty  by obtaining collateral based on the nature of the lending arrangement and management assessment of the client  and by applying uniform credit standards maintained for all activities with credit risk 
as appropriate  various committees evaluate and approve credit standards and oversee the credit risk management function related to our loans and other investments 
these committees primary responsibilities include ensuring the adequacy of our credit risk management infrastructure  overseeing credit risk management strategies and methodologies  monitoring economic and market conditions having an impact on our credit related activities and evaluating and monitoring overall credit risk and monitoring our clients financial condition and performance 
substantially all new loans have been originated at capitalsource bank  and we maintain a comprehensive credit policy manual for all loans that is supplemented by specific loan product underwriting guidelines 
among other things  the credit policy manual sets forth requirements that meet the regulations enforced by both the fdic and the dfi 
examples of such requirements include the loan to value limitations for real estate secured loans  standards for real estate appraisals and other third party reports and collateral insurance requirements 
our underwriting guidelines outline specific underwriting standards and minimum specific risk acceptance criteria for each lending product offered 
loan types defined within these guidelines have three broad categories  within our commercial  real estate and real estate construction loan portfolios 
these categories include asset based loans  cash flow loans and real estate loans  and each of these broad categories has specific subsections that define in detail the following loan structures  which includes the lien positions  amortization provisions and loan tenors  collateral descriptions and appropriate valuation methods  underwriting considerations which include recommended diligence and verification requirements  and specific risk acceptance criteria which enumerate for each loan type the minimum acceptable credit performance standards 
examples of these criteria include maximum loan to value percentages for real estate loans  maximum advance rates for asset based loans and minimum debt service coverage ratios for most loans 
we measure and document each loan compliance with our specific risk acceptance criteria at underwriting 
if at underwriting  there is an exception to these criteria  an explanation of the factors that mitigate this additional risk is considered before an approval is granted 
upon the amendment of any loan agreement  we also measure a loan compliance with our specific risk acceptance criteria 
a record of which loans have exceptions to our specific risk acceptance criteria at underwriting or upon modification is maintained and is reported to the credit policy committee of the bank board 
we continuously monitor a client ability to perform under its obligations 
additionally  we manage the size and risk profile of our loan portfolio by syndicating loan exposure to other lenders and selling loans 
under our credit risk management process  each loan is assigned an internal risk rating that is based on defined credit review standards 
while rating criteria vary by product  each loan rating focuses on the borrower financial performance and financial standing  the borrower ability to repay the loan  and the adequacy of the collateral securing the loan 
subsequent to loan origination  risk ratings are monitored and reassessed on an ongoing basis 
if necessary  risk ratings are adjusted to reflect changes in the client financial condition  cash flow or financial position 
we use loan aggregations by risk rating as one measure of credit risk within the loan portfolio 
in addition to risk ratings  we consider the market trend of collateral values and loan concentrations by borrower industries and real estate property types where applicable 
concentrations of credit risk in our normal course of business  we engage in lending activities with clients primarily throughout the united states 
as of december   borrowers in the following industries comprised the following concentrations by loan balance health care and social assistance  and real estate and rental and leasing  which represented approximately and of the outstanding loan portfolio  respectively 
as of december  lender finance primarily timeshare loans were our largest loan concentration by sector and represented approximately of our loan portfolio 
apart from the borrower industry concentrations  loans secured by real estate represented approximately of our outstanding loan portfolio as of december  within this area  the largest property type concentration was the multifamily category  comprising approximately of total loans and of loans secured by real estate 
the largest geographical concentration was in california  comprising approximately of total loans and of loans secured by real estate 
selected information pertaining to our largest credit relationships as of december  was as follows loan balance of total portfolio loan type industry amount of loan s at origination loan commitment performing specific reserves underlying collateral date of last collateral appraisal amount of last appraisal in thousands commercial timeshare yes timeshare receivables n a n a real estate resort vacation club yes portfolio of vacation properties various ranging from may to september n a represents the primary collateral supporting the loan 
in certain cases  there may be additional types of collateral 
the collateral that secures our loan balance of million as of december  primarily consisted of timeshare receivables and timeshare real estate that had a total value of million as of december  total senior debt  including our loan balance  secured by the collateral was million as of december  the collateral that secures our loan balance of million as of december  consists of a loan to a vacation resort company which is collateralized by its respective underlying vacation resort properties 
non performing loans include all loans on non accrual status and accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments 
there were credit relationships in the non performing portfolio as of december   and our largest non performing credit relationship totaled million and comprised of our total non performing loans 
derivative counterparty credit risk derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to such agreements 
this risk consists primarily of the termination value of agreements where we are in a favorable position 
credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered and provided for separately from the allowance for loan and lease losses 
we manage the credit risk associated with various derivative agreements through counterparty credit review and monitoring procedures 
we obtain collateral from all counterparties based on terms stipulated in the collateral support annex 
we also monitor all exposure and collateral requirements daily on a per counterparty basis 
we continually monitor the fair value of collateral received from counterparties and may request additional collateral from counterparties or return collateral pledged as deemed appropriate 
our agreements generally include master netting agreements whereby the counterparties are entitled to settle their derivative positions net 
as of december   our derivative financial instruments had no gross positive fair values and as such  we had no exposure to counterparty risk 
as of december   our derivative financial instruments had gross positive fair value of million  offset through master netting agreements by gross negative fair value of million 
as such  we had million of net exposure to counterparty risk as of december  market risk management market risk is the risk that values of assets and liabilities or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate fluctuations 
this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations and or activities  including loans  securities  short term borrowings  long term debt  trading account assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations  primarily including our loans and borrowings 
our traditional loan products are non trading positions and are reported at amortized cost 
additionally  debt obligations that we incur to fund our business operations are recorded at historical cost 
while gaap requires a historical cost view of such assets and liabilities  these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk refers to the timing and volume differences in the re pricing of our rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in the general level of market interest rates and changes in the shape and level of various indices  including libor based indices and the prime rate 
we attempt to mitigate exposure to the earnings impact of the interest rate changes by conducting the majority of our loan and deposit activity using interest rate structures that resets on a periodic basis 
the majority of our loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to the libor rate or a prime based rate with most of the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate 
the majority of the deposit portfolio is comprised of certificates of deposits that generally have an initial term between and months 
our investment and borrowings portfolios are used to offset a portion of the remaining re pricing risk that exists between our loans and deposits 
the company measures interest rate risk and the effect of changes in market interest rates using a net interest income simulation analysis 
the analysis incorporates forecasted changes in the balance sheet and assumptions that reflect the current interest rate environment 
the analysis estimates the interest rate impact of parallel increases in interest rates over a twelve month horizon 
the estimated changes in net interest income for a twelve month period based on changes in the interest rates applied to the combined portfolios of our segments as of december   were as follows in thousands rate change basis points the analysis above incorporates the company assumptions for the market yield curve  pricing sensitivities on loans and deposits  reinvestment of asset and liability cash flows  and prepayments on loans and securities 
the simulation analysis includes management projection for loan originations  investment and funding strategies 
the new loans  investment securities  borrowings and deposits are assumed to have interest rates that reflect our forecast of prevailing market terms 
we also assumed that libor and prime rates do not fall below for loans and borrowings 
parent company loans  investment securities and borrowings are assumed to convert to cash as they run off 
actual results may differ from forecasted results due to changes in market conditions as well as changes in management strategies 
as of december   approximately of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our loans had interest rate floors and were accruing interest 
of the loans with interest rate floors and accruing interest  approximately had contractual rates below the interest rate floor and the floor was providing a benefit to us 
the loans with contractual interest rate floors as of december  were as follows amount outstanding percentage of total portfolio in thousands loans with contractual interest rates below the interest rate floor exceeding the interest rate floor at the interest rate floor loans with interest rate floors on non accrual loans with no interest rate floor total as of december   the outstanding unpaid principal balance of loans subject to interest rate floors by adjustable rate index and by the spread between the floor rate and the fully indexed rate were as follows above floor basis points total in thousands month libor month libor month libor month libor month euribor prime other treasuries total accruing adjustable rate loans non accrual loans subject to interest rate floors total loans subject to interest rate floors loans not subject to interest rate floors total loans we enter into basis swap agreements to hedge basis risk between our libor based term debt and the prime based loans pledged as collateral for that debt 
these basis swaps modify our exposure to interest rate risk by synthetically converting prime rate loans to one month libor 
our basis swap agreements partially protect us from the risk that interest collected under prime rate loans will not be sufficient to service the interest due under the one month libor based term debt 
we have also entered into relatively short dated forward exchange agreements to minimize exposure to foreign currency risk arising from foreign currency denominated loans 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this preparation requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions  and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and  as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
these policies relate to the allowance for loan and lease losses  fair value measurements  and income taxes 
we have established detailed policies and procedures to ensure that the assumptions and judgments surrounding these areas are adequately controlled  independently reviewed and consistently applied from period to period 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures related to these estimates 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is management estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
management performs detailed reviews of the portfolio quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred and to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses  based on historical and current trends and other factors affecting loan and lease losses 
additions to the allowance for loan and lease losses are charged to current period earnings through the provision for loan and lease losses 
amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged directly against the allowance for loan and lease losses  while amounts recovered on previously charged off accounts increase the allowance 
the loan portfolio includes balances with non homogeneous exposures 
these loans are evaluated individually  and are risk rated based upon borrower  collateral and industry specific information that management believes is relevant to determining the occurrence of a loss event and measuring impairment 
loans are then segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale 
higher risk loans are individually analyzed for impairment 
management establishes specific allowances for loans determined to be individually impaired 
all impaired loans are valued to determine if a specific allowance is warranted 
the valuation analysis for the specific allowance is based upon one of the three valuation methods i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan initially contracted effective yield  ii the loan observable market price  or iii the fair value of the collateral 
the appropriate valuation methodology generally reflects the chosen loan resolution strategy being pursued to maximize the recovery of the loan 
estimated costs to sell are considered in the impairment valuation when such costs are expected to reduce the cash flows available to repay or otherwise satisfy the loan 
any guarantees provided by the borrower are typically not considered when determining our potential for specific loss 
in addition to the specific allowances for impaired loans  we maintain allowances that are based on an evaluation of inherent losses in our commercial loan portfolio 
these allowances are based on an analysis of historical loss experience  current economic conditions and performance trends and any other pertinent information within specific portfolio segments 
as set forth in detail below  the process for determining the reserve factors and the related level of loan loss reserves is subject to numerous estimates and assumptions that require judgment about the timing  frequency and severity of credit losses that could materially affect the provision for loan and lease losses and  therefore  net income 
within this process  management is required to make judgments related  but not limited  to i risk ratings for loans  ii market and collateral values and discount rates for individually evaluated loans  iii loss rates used for commercial loans  and iv adjustments made to assess certain factors  including overall credit and economic conditions 
our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and to corresponding reserve factors that we use to estimate the allowance and that are reflective of historical losses 
we assign reserve factors to the loans in our portfolio  which dictate the percentage of the total outstanding loan balance that we reserve 
we review the loan portfolio information regularly to determine whether it is necessary for us to further revise our reserve factors 
the reserve factors used in the calculation are determined by analyzing the following elements the types of loans  for example  land  commercial real estate  healthcare receivables or cash flow  our historical losses with regard to the loan types  borrower industry  the relative seniority of our security interest  our expected losses with regard to the loan types  and the internal risk rating assigned to the loans 
we update these reserve factors periodically to capture actual and recent behavioral characteristics of the portfolios 
we estimate the allowance by applying historical loss factors derived from loss tracking mechanisms associated with actual portfolio activity over a specified period of time 
these estimates are adjusted when necessary based on additional analysis of long term average loss experience  external loan loss data and other risks identified from current and expected credit market conditions and trends  including management judgment for estimated inaccuracy and uncertainty 
we also consider the need for qualitative factors which we use to provide for uncertainties surrounding our estimation process including changes in the volume of our problem loans  changes in the value of collateral for our collateral dependent loans  and the existence of certain loan concentrations 
the sensitivity of our allowance for loan and lease losses to potential changes in our reserve factors in terms of percentage applied to our overall loan portfolio as of december   was as follows change in reserve factors estimated increase decrease in the allowance for loan and lease losses in thousands these sensitivity analyses do not represent management expectations of the deterioration  or improvement  in risk ratings  but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs 
we believe the reserve factors currently in use are appropriate 
the process of determining the level of allowance for loan and lease losses involves a high degree of judgment 
if our internal risk ratings  reserve factors or specific reserves for impaired loans are not accurate  our allowance for loan and lease losses may be misstated 
in addition  our operating results are sensitive to changes in the reserve factors utilized to determine our related provision for loan and lease losses 
we also consider whether losses might be incurred in connection with unfunded commitments to lend although  in making this assessment  we exclude from consideration those commitments for which funding is subject to our approval based on the adequacy of underlying collateral that is required to be presented by a borrower or other terms and conditions 
any such allowance for unfunded commitments is included in other liabilities 
fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie  the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in accordance with gaap  we prioritize the inputs into valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
this hierarchy  consisting of three levels of inputs  prioritizes observable data from active markets and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities that are actively traded in the marketplace or that have values based on readily available market value data require little  if any  subjectivity to be applied when determining the fair value 
these are classified as either level or level whether an asset or liability is classified as level or level depends largely on its similarity with other items in the marketplace and our ability to obtain corroborative data regarding whether the market in which the instrument trades is active 
fair value measurements on assets and liabilities that are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall measurement are classified as level as of december   and of total assets and total liabilities  respectively  were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis 
none of these assets carried at fair value on a recurring basis were classified as level  billion of total assets measured on a recurring basis were classified as level and million of total assets measured on a recurring basis were classified as level as of december  from a liability perspective  thousand of total liabilities measured on a recurring basis were classified as level as of december  as of december   no liabilities were classified as level or level within the fair value hierarchy 
it is our policy to maximize the use of observable market based inputs  when appropriate  to value our assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis or to determine whether an adjustment to fair value is needed for assets and liabilities carried at fair value on a non recurring basis 
given the nature of some of our assets carried at fair value  whether on a recurring or nonrecurring basis  clearly determinable market based valuation inputs are often not available 
therefore  the fair value measurements of these instruments utilize unobservable inputs and are classified as level within the fair value hierarchy 
we may be required to apply significant judgments in determining our fair value estimates for these assets 
due to the unavailability of observable inputs for our level assets  management assumptions used in the valuation models play a significant role in these fair value estimates 
in times of severe market volatility and illiquidity  there may be more uncertainty and variability with lack of market data to use in the valuation process 
an illiquid market is one in which little or no observable activity has occurred or one that lacks willing buyers 
to factor in market illiquidity  management makes adjustments to certain inputs in the valuation models and makes other assumptions to ensure fair values are reasonable and reflect current market conditions 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measurement 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  management own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
for additional information  see note  fair value measurements  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  the estimates of fair values reflect our best judgments regarding the appropriate valuation methods and assumptions that market participants would use in determining fair value 
the amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of an asset or liability is affected by a number of factors  such as the type of instrument  the liquidity of the markets for the instrument and the contractual characteristics of the instrument 
the selection of a method to estimate fair value for each type of financial instrument depends on the reliability and availability of relevant market data 
judgments in these cases include  but are not limited to selection of third party market data sources  evaluation of the expected reliability of the estimate  reliability  timeliness and cost of alternative valuation methodologies  and selection of proxy instruments  as necessary 
due to the lack of observability of significant inputs  we must make assumptions in deriving our valuation inputs based on relevant empirical data surrounding interest rates  asset prices  timing of future cash flows and credit performance 
in addition  assumptions must be made to reflect constraints on liquidity  counterparty credit quality and other unobservable factors 
imprecision surrounding our assumptions related to unobservable market inputs may impact the fair value of our assets and liabilities 
furthermore  use of different methods to derive the fair value of our assets and liabilities could result in different fair value estimates at the measurement date 
we record fair value adjustments on our loans held for investment when we have determined that it is necessary to record a specific reserve against the loans  and we measure impairment using the fair value of the loan collateral 
during the year ended december   we recognized losses of million related to our loans held for investment measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis 
these losses were attributable to an increased number of loans requiring a specific reserve during the year  as well as declines in the fair value of collateral for these loans 
income taxes we are subject to the income tax laws of the united states  its states and municipalities and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
these tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant governmental taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
we must also make estimates about when  in the future  certain items will affect taxable income in the various tax jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be subject to review adjudication by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or audit 
we provide for income taxes as a c corporation on income earned from operations 
for the tax year ended december   our subsidiaries were not able to participate in the filing of a consolidated federal tax return 
beginning in  we reconsolidated our subsidiaries for federal tax purposes 
we are subject to federal  foreign  state and local taxation in various jurisdictions 
periodic reviews of the carrying amount of deferred tax assets are made to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all evidence  both positive and negative  is evaluated when making this determination 
items considered in this analysis include the ability to carry back losses to recoup taxes previously paid  the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies  historical financial performance  expectations of future earnings and the length of statutory carryforward periods 
significant judgment is required in assessing future earnings trends and the timing of reversals of temporary differences 
in  we established a valuation allowance against a substantial portion of our net deferred tax assets where we determined that there was significant negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize such assets 
negative evidence we considered in making this determination included the history of operating losses and uncertainty regarding the realization of a portion of the deferred tax assets at future points in time 
as of december  and  the valuation allowance was million and million  respectively 
during  we reversed million of the valuation allowance  and such reversal was recorded as a benefit in our income tax expenses 
each of the deferred tax assets was evaluated based on our evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence with respect to our ability to realize the deferred tax asset  including considering their associated character and jurisdiction 
the decision to reverse a large portion of the valuation allowance was based on our evaluation of all positive and negative evidence which did not include any significant tax planning strategies 
a cumulative loss position  such as we had for the previous three year period ended december   is generally considered significant negative evidence in assessing the realizability of a deferred tax asset 
however  subsequent to the establishment of the valuation allowance in  significant positive evidence had developed which overcame this negative evidence such that  during the year ended december   management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
this determination was made not based upon a single event or occurrence  but based upon the accumulation of all positive and negative evidence including recent trends in our earnings and taxable income 
other positive evidence included the projection of future taxable income based on strong capitalsource bank earnings  improved asset performance trends  substantial decline in the parent company operations and assets  and one time losses included in the three year cumulative pre tax loss ie  debt extinguishment loss 
additionally  we are no longer in a cumulative loss position at the end of we have net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes that can be utilized to offset future taxable income 
if we were to undergo a change in ownership of more than of our capital stock over a three year period as measured under section of the internal revenue code the code  our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  certain built in losses and other tax attributes recognized in years after the ownership change generally would be limited 
the annual limit would equal the product of a the applicable long term tax exempt rate and b the value of the relevant taxable entity capital stock immediately before the ownership change 
these change of ownership rules generally focus on ownership changes involving stockholders owning directly or indirectly or more of a company outstanding stock  including certain public groups of stockholders as set forth under section of the code  and those arising from new stock issuances and other equity transactions 
the determination of whether an ownership change occurs is complex and not entirely within our control 
no assurance can be given as to whether in the future we will undergo an ownership change under section of the code 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million of income tax benefit and million of income tax expense  respectively  with respect to our income from continuing operations 
the effective income tax rate for these periods was and  respectively 
we file income tax returns with the united states and various state  local and foreign jurisdictions and generally remain subject to examinations by these tax jurisdictions for tax years through we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the tax years to  and by certain state jurisdictions for the tax years to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  which are discussed in detail in management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the market risk management section 
in addition  for a detailed discussion of our derivatives  see note  derivative instruments and note  credit risk  in our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  management report on internal controls over financial reporting the management of capitalsource inc capitalsource is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
capitalsource internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to capitalsource management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
capitalsource management assessed the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting as of december  in making this assessment  it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control integrated framework 
based on such assessment management believes that  as of december   the company internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria 
capitalsource independent registered public accounting firm  ernst young llp  has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of the company internal control over financial reporting 
this report appears on page 
report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting the board of directors and shareholders of capitalsource inc we have audited capitalsource inc capitalsource or the company internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on criteria established in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria 
capitalsource management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting  and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying management report on internal controls over financial reporting 
our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 
we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states 
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects 
our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting  assessing the risk that a material weakness exists  testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk  and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances 
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 
a company internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
a company internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that  in reasonable detail  accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company  and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of the company assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
in our opinion  capitalsource inc maintained  in all material respects  effective internal control over financial reporting as of december   based on the coso criteria 
we also have audited  in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  the consolidated balance sheets of capitalsource inc as of december  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive income  shareholders equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december  and our report dated february  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon
