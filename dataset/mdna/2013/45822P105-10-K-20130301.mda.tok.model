item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified energy holding company with regulated natural gas and electric utility operations serving customers in illinois  michigan  minnesota  and wisconsin  nonregulated energy operations  and an approximate equity ownership interest in atc a federally regulated electric transmission company operating in wisconsin  michigan  minnesota  and illinois 
strategic overview our goal is to create long term value for shareholders and customers through growth in our core regulated businesses 
we also have a nonregulated energy services business segment that is focused on growth within a controlled risk profile 
the essential components of our business strategy are maintaining and growing a strong regulated utility base a strong regulated utility base is essential to maintaining a strong balance sheet  predictable cash flows  the desired risk profile  attractive dividends  and quality credit ratings 
we believe the following projects have helped  or will help  maintain and grow our regulated utility base and meet our customers needs wps pending purchase of the fox energy center  a megawatt combined cycle electric generating facility located in wisconsin  in the system modernization and reliability project that wps plans to begin in to underground certain electric distribution lines in northern wisconsin wps continued investment in environmental projects to improve air quality and meet or exceed the requirements set by environmental regulators our approximate ownership interest in atc  a transmission company that had over billion of transmission assets at december  atc plans to invest approximately billion to billion during the next ten years 
although atc equity requirements to fund its capital investments will primarily be met by earnings reinvestment  we plan to continue to fund our share of the equity portion of future atc growth as necessary an accelerated annual investment in natural gas distribution facilities primarily replacement of cast iron mains at pgl 
for more detailed information on our capital expenditure program  see liquidity and capital resources  capital requirements 
providing safe  reliable  competitively priced  and environmentally sound energy and related services our mission is to provide customers with the best value in energy and related services 
we strive to effectively operate a mixed portfolio of generation assets and prudently invest in new generation and distribution assets  while maintaining or exceeding environmental standards 
this allows us to provide a safe  reliable  value priced service to our customers 
our recent entry into the compressed natural gas fueling marketplace  while not currently significant  is complementary to our existing businesses and is consistent with our mission 
operating a nonregulated energy services business segment with a controlled risk and capital profile through our nonregulated integrys energy services subsidiary  we provide retail natural gas and electric products to end use customers in the northeast quadrant of the united states 
this subsidiary is focused on operating within select retail electric and natural gas markets in our current market footprint where we have experience and believe we will have the most success growing our recurring retail customer based business 
in addition  integrys energy services continues to develop  acquire  own  and operate renewable energy projects  primarily distributed solar generation  in the united states 
this strategy is intended to result in dependable cash and earnings contributions with a controlled risk and capital profile 
integrating resources to provide operational excellence we are committed to integrating resources of all our businesses  while meeting all applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
this will provide the best value to customers and shareholders by leveraging the individual capabilities and expertise of each business and lowering costs 
operational excellence initiatives have been implemented to reduce costs and encourage top performance in the areas of project management  process improvement  contract administration  and compliance 
placing strong emphasis on asset and risk management our asset management strategy calls for the continuous assessment of existing assets  the acquisition of assets  and contractual commitments to obtain resources that complement our existing business and strategy 
the goal is to provide the most efficient use of resources while maximizing return and maintaining an acceptable risk profile 
this strategy focuses on acquiring assets consistent with strategic plans and disposing of assets  including property  plant  and equipment and entire business units  that are no longer strategic to ongoing operations  are not performing as intended  or have an unacceptable risk profile 
we maintain a portfolio approach to risk and earnings 
our risk management strategy includes the management of market  credit  liquidity  and operational risks through the normal course of business 
forward purchases and sales of electric capacity  energy  natural gas  and other commodities and the use of derivative financial instruments  including commodity swaps and options  provide tools to reduce the risk associated with price movement in a volatile energy market 
each business unit manages the risk profile related to these instruments consistent with our risk management policies  which are approved by the board of directors 
the corporate risk management group  which reports through the chief financial officer  provides corporate oversight

management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas utility revenues since we pass through prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs to our customers in current rates 
there was an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during  which had no impact on margins 
regulated natural gas utility segment margins increased million  driven by an approximate million net increase in margins due to rate orders 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
the rate increases at pgl and nsg  effective january   and other impacts of rate design  had an approximate million positive impact on margins 
a reduction in rates at wps  effective january   resulted in an approximate million negative impact on margins 
the rate decrease was driven by reduced contributions to the focus on energy program  which promotes residential and small business energy efficiency and renewable energy products 
the margin impact from the reduction in contributions is offset by lower operating expenses 
merc had an approximate million decrease in margins in primarily driven by the impact of a rate order from the mpuc finalized in january a preliminary order was received in july that adjusted interim rates in effect since february  an approximate million net increase in margins related to certain riders at pgl and nsg 
this increase was offset by an equal increase in operating expenses  resulting in no impact on earnings 
pgl and nsg billed approximately million more to customers for energy efficiency programs in pgl and nsg refunded approximately million more to customers under bad debt riders in pgl and nsg recovered approximately million less for environmental cleanup costs at their former manufactured gas plant sites in the lower recovery reflects a pass through to customers in rates of an environmental settlement received by nsg from a potentially responsible party performance and payment bond 
the impact of the settlement was partially offset by an increase in remediation activity at pgl during see note  commitment and contingencies  for more information about the manufactured gas plant sites 
the above increases in margins were partially offset by an approximate million net decrease in margins  including the impact of decoupling  due to a decrease in volumes sold 
substantially warmer weather during drove an approximate million decrease in margins 
heating degree days decreased 
lower sales volumes excluding the impact of weather resulted in an approximate million decrease in margins 
sales volumes were slightly lower due to lower use per customer 
decoupling impacts at certain natural gas utilities drove an approximate million increase in margins 
decoupling does not cover all jurisdictions or customer classes 
decoupling accruals in had an approximate million positive impact on the year over year variance 
decoupling lessened the negative impact from some of the decreased sales volumes at wps and mgu through higher future recoveries from customers 
this was limited by an million decoupling cap that was reached by wps during the second quarter of in  reserves were recorded against all decoupling accruals at pgl and nsg after an icc order declared these amounts may be subject to refund 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
decoupling accruals in had an approximate million positive impact on the year over year variance 
decoupling lessened the positive impact in from some of the higher sales volumes at pgl  nsg  wps  and mgu through higher future refunds to customers 
operating income operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment decreased million 
this decrease was driven by a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to a million increase in natural gas distribution costs  primarily at pgl 
the increase was partially due to increased labor costs driven by annual wage increases  as well as additional employees required for compliance work related to inside safety inspections and corrosion review 
additional contractors were also needed for street restoration and pipe maintenance to replace employees that were moved to the amrp project 
a million increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulting from increased investment in property and equipment  primarily driven by the amrp 
an approximate million net increase at pgl and nsg driven by an increase in regulatory liabilities related to energy efficiency programs  partially offset by higher amortization of regulatory liabilities related to bad debt riders and lower amortization of regulatory assets related to environmental cleanup costs for manufactured gas plant sites 
margins increased by an equal amount  resulting in no impact on earnings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in energy efficiency program expenses related to wps participation in the focus on energy program and merc conservation improvement program 
costs for both programs are recovered in rates 
an million decrease in bad debt expense  driven by a new cost of gas component included as part of pgl and nsg bad debt expense tracking mechanisms 
the change in the bad debt mechanisms was approved in pgl and nsg rate orders  effective january  in those orders  the icc required that a natural gas cost component of the bad debt mechanism be charged to customers based on actual volumes and natural gas prices 
as a result of this component  bad debt expense was primarily impacted by lower natural gas costs in and  to a lesser extent  by the decrease in sales volumes 
however  million of the decrease in bad debt expense does not impact earnings as it is offset by lower rates  resulting in lower margins 
a million decrease in workers compensation expense related to both fewer incidents and less severe injuries during  primarily at pgl 
a million decrease in asset usage charges from ibs driven by certain computer hardware that was fully depreciated in compared with margins natural gas utility margins are defined as natural gas utility operating revenues less purchased natural gas costs 
management believes that natural gas utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating natural gas utility operations than natural gas utility revenues since we pass through prudently incurred natural gas commodity costs to our customers in current rates 
there was an approximate decrease in the average per unit cost of natural gas sold during  which had no impact on margins 
regulated natural gas utility segment margins decreased million and was driven by the approximate million negative year over year impact related to certain riders at pgl and nsg 
this decrease in margins was offset by an equal decrease in operating expenses  resulting in no impact on earnings 
we refunded approximately million more to customers under bad debt riders in we also recovered approximately million less for environmental cleanup costs at our former manufactured gas plant sites in see note  commitment and contingencies  for more information on our manufactured gas plant sites 
the decrease in margins was partially offset by an approximate million net increase in margins  including the impact of decoupling  due to a increase in volumes sold 
higher sales volumes excluding the impact of weather resulted in approximately million of additional margins 
we attribute this increase to a combination of higher use per customer  higher average customer counts  and improved economic conditions for certain customers 
colder weather during drove an approximate million increase in margins 
heating degree days increased 
decoupling impacts at certain natural gas utilities drove an approximate million decrease in margins 
decoupling does not cover all jurisdictions or customer classes 
decoupling accruals in had an approximate million negative impact on the year over year variance 
decoupling lessened the positive impact in from some of the increased sales volumes at pgl  nsg  wps  and mgu through higher future refunds to customers 
decoupling accruals in had an approximate million negative impact on the year over year variance 
decoupling lessened the negative impact in from some of the decreased sales volumes at pgl  nsg  wps  and mgu through higher future recoveries from customers 
an approximate million net increase in margins due to rate orders 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
merc conservation improvement program cip rate increase  effective november   and its interim natural gas distribution rate increase  effective february   had a combined approximate million positive impact on margin 
the cip margins of approximately million did not impact earnings as they were offset by an increase in operating and maintenance expense 
the rate increases at pgl and nsg  effective january   and other impacts of rate design  had an approximate million net positive impact on margins 
a reduction in rates at wps  effective january   resulted in an approximate million negative impact on margins 
an approximate million increase in margins due to a year over year positive impact from the amortization of a regulatory asset at wps related to energy efficiency legislation implemented in a prior year 
an approximate million increase in margins due to a rider approved through september  for recovery of amrp costs at pgl 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
operating income operating income at the regulated natural gas utility segment increased million 
this increase was primarily driven by a million decrease in operating expenses  partially offset by the million decrease in margins discussed above 
the decrease in operating expenses primarily related to an approximate million decrease due to higher amortization of regulatory liabilities related to bad debt riders and lower amortization of regulatory assets related to environmental cleanup costs for manufactured gas plant sites  all at pgl and nsg 
margins decreased by an equal amount  resulting in no impact on earnings 
a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
wps received approval for lower depreciation rates from the pscw  effective january  the decrease also reflects the impact of a million write off of certain mgu assets in based on an order from the mpsc that was subsequently reversed by the michigan court of appeals in january see note  regulatory environment  for more information 
a million decrease in employee benefits expense  partially driven by lower employee health care costs 
a million decrease in customer accounts expense resulting from lower customer call volumes and a decrease in labor associated with fewer disconnections 
a million decrease in asset usage charges from ibs driven by certain computer hardware that was fully depreciated in these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in natural gas distribution costs 
the increase was partially due to additional labor related to distribution operations activities and additional consulting costs associated with a work asset management system and the amrp 
transportation costs  building maintenance  meter maintenance projects  and other miscellaneous distribution costs also contributed to the increase 
a million increase in expenses related to energy conservation and efficiency programs 
this net increase includes expenses related to the cip that were recovered through the merc rate increase discussed in margins above 
other expense other expense decreased million  driven by a decrease in interest expense on long term debt 
pgl refinanced some of its long term debt at lower interest rates in the second half of in addition  wps did not replace certain senior notes that matured in the third quarter of regulated electric utility segment operations year ended december change in over change in over millions  except degree days revenues fuel and purchased power costs margins operating and maintenance expense depreciation and amortization expense taxes other than income taxes operating income miscellaneous income interest expense other expense income before taxes sales in kilowatt hours residential commercial and industrial wholesale other total sales in kilowatt hours weather wps heating degree days cooling degree days weather uppco heating degree days cooling degree days compared with margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
management believes that electric utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating electric utility operations than electric operating revenues 
to the extent changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers  the changes are offset by comparable changes in operating revenues 
regulated electric utility segment margins decreased million  driven by an approximate million decrease in margins related to wps rate case effects 
although the pscw approved a rate increase effective january   it was driven by anticipated increases in fuel and purchased power costs that did not materialize 
under the fuel rules  we deferred a portion of the difference between the fuel window costs included in rates and the actual fuel window costs 
this portion will be refunded to customers 
excluding the impact from fuel and purchased power costs  the rate case re opener resulted in a rate decrease 
the rate decrease was primarily driven by reduced contributions to the focus on energy program  which promotes residential and small business energy efficiency and renewable energy products 
the approximate million margin impact from the reduction in contributions to the focus on energy program was offset by lower operating expenses due to reduced payments to the program in fuel costs not included in the fuel window were lower relative to the rate case approved amounts in this resulted in an approximate million negative year over year impact on margins 
an approximate million decrease in wholesale margins  driven by a decrease in sales volumes 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in sales to one wholesale large customer and the loss of wholesale customers 
an approximate million net decrease in margins from retail customers due to variances related to sales volumes 
the margin impact from the period over period change in sales volumes was partially offset by the impacts from decoupling mechanisms 
although decoupling was implemented to minimize the impact of changes in sales volumes  wps decoupling mechanism does not cover all customers or jurisdictions 
uppco decoupling mechanism was terminated at the end of a decrease in sales volumes to residential customers  driven by warmer weather during the heating season  resulted in an approximate million decrease in margins 
margins increased approximately million due to decoupling mechanisms 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate million increase in margins due to a retail electric rate increase at uppco  effective january  operating income operating income at the regulated electric utility segment decreased million 
the decrease was driven by the million decrease in margins discussed above  partially offset by a million decrease in operating expenses 
the decrease in operating expenses was driven by an million decrease in customer assistance expense driven by reduced payments to the focus on energy program 
these payments are recovered in rates 
a million decrease in bad debt expense  driven by the year over year impact of the write off of receivables related to the bankruptcy of an uppco retail customer and the subsequent recovery of those receivables in the fourth quarter of a million decrease in asset usage charges from ibs driven by certain computer hardware that was fully depreciated in a million decrease in maintenance expense  mainly due to fewer repairs at uppco hydroelectric facilities in as well as fewer storms in wps service territories in compared with these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in employee benefit related expenses 
the increase was primarily due to an increase in postretirement medical expenses as well as the year over year change in the fair value of amounts owed to plan participants under deferred compensation plans 
partially offsetting these increases was lower pension expense driven by an increase in contributions  which increased plan assets 
other expense other expense decreased million  driven by the maturity and repayment of million of long term debt at wps in august also contributing to the decrease in other expense was an increase in afudc  primarily related to environmental compliance projects at the columbia plant 
compared with margins electric margins are defined as electric operating revenues less fuel and purchased power costs 
management believes that electric utility margins provide a more meaningful basis for evaluating utility operations than electric operating revenues 
to the extent changes in fuel and purchased power costs are passed through to customers  the changes are offset by comparable changes in operating revenues 
any significant changes in fuel and purchased power costs that are not recovered from customers are explained in the margin discussion below 
regulated electric utility segment margins decreased million  driven by an approximate million decrease in retail margins due to differences between the wps rate order and the previous rate order 
although the rate order included a lower authorized return on common equity  lower rate base  and other reduced costs  which resulted in lower total revenues and margins  the rate order also projected lower total sales volumes  which led to a rate increase on a per unit basis 
the rate increase  calculated on a per unit basis  was more than offset by the decoupling mechanism due to changes in the rate order that impact the decoupling calculation 
for more details on the wps rate order  see note  regulatory environment 
an approximate million decrease in margins from wholesale customers 
the decrease was due to lower sales volumes and lower nonfuel revenue requirements driven by a lower return on common equity  lower rate base  and other reduced costs 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate million increase in margins driven by a retail electric rate increase at uppco 
an approximate million increase in margins due to a year over year positive impact from the amortization of a regulatory asset at wps related to energy efficiency legislation implemented in a prior year 
operating income operating income at the regulated electric utility segment decreased million  driven by the million decrease in margins and a million increase in operating expenses 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to a million increase in the amortization of various regulatory deferrals 
this increase was offset in revenues  resulting in no impact on earnings 
a million increase in customer assistance expense related to payments made to the focus on energy program 
the program promotes residential and small business energy efficiency and renewable energy products 
a million increase in taxes other than income taxes  driven by increases in gross receipts taxes and property taxes 
a million increase in electric transmission expense 
a million increase in injuries and damages expenses 
these increases were substantially offset by a million decrease in employee benefit costs 
the decrease was partially due to lower pension expense driven by an increase in contributions  which increased plan assets 
a million decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
the pscw approved lower depreciation rates effective january   and we had lower software amortization in other expense other expense decreased million  driven by a decrease in interest expense due to the maturity and repayment of million of long term debt at wps in august electric transmission investment segment operations year ended december change in over change in over millions earnings from equity method investments compared with earnings from equity method investments earnings from equity method investments at the electric transmission investment segment increased million in the increase resulted from higher earnings related to our approximate ownership interest in atc

capital resources management prioritizes the use of capital and debt capacity  determines cash management policies  uses risk management policies to hedge the impact of volatile commodity prices  and makes decisions regarding capital requirements in order to manage the liquidity and capital resource needs of the business segments 
we plan to meet our capital requirements for the period through primarily through internally generated funds net of forecasted dividend payments and debt and equity financings 
we plan to keep debt to equity ratios at levels that can support current credit ratings and corporate growth 
under an existing shelf registration statement  we may issue debt  equity  certain types of hybrid securities  and other financial instruments with amounts  prices  and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings 
wps currently has two shelf registration statements 
under these registration statements  wps may issue up to million of additional senior debt securities and up to million of preferred stock

various laws  regulations  and financial covenants impose restrictions on the ability of certain of our regulated utility subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of dividends 
our regulated utility subsidiaries are prohibited from loaning funds to us  either directly or indirectly 
although these restrictions limit the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to us  management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on our ability to access cash for payment of dividends on common stock or other future funding obligations

other future considerations decoupling the illinois attorney general is currently appealing the icc authority to approve pgl and nsg permanent decoupling mechanism 
as a result  revenues collected under this mechanism are potentially subject to refund 
therefore  beginning in the second quarter of  pgl and nsg established offsetting reserves equal to decoupling amounts accrued 
in november  pgl and nsg filed briefs with the illinois appellate court defending the authority of the icc to approve the decoupling mechanism 
since the decoupling mechanism is still in place  pgl and nsg also intend to file with the icc for rate recovery  beginning in april  for amounts accrued related to decoupling 
see note  regulatory environment  for more information on all of our subsidiaries decoupling mechanisms 
climate change the epa began regulating greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act in january by applying the best available control technology bact requirements associated with the new source review program to new and modified larger greenhouse gas emitters 
technology to remove and sequester greenhouse gas emissions is not commercially available at scale 
therefore  the epa issued guidance that defines bact in terms of improvements in energy efficiency as opposed to relying on pollution control equipment 
in march  the epa issued a proposed rule that would impose a carbon dioxide emission rate limit on new electric generating units 
the proposed limit may prevent the construction of new coal units until technology becomes commercially available 
the epa planned to propose performance standards for existing units in and finalize them in  however  that proposal has been delayed 
a risk exists that any greenhouse gas legislation or regulation will increase the cost of producing energy using fossil fuels 
however  we believe that capital expenditures being made at our plants are appropriate under any reasonable mandatory greenhouse gas program 
we also believe that our future expenditures that may be required to control greenhouse gas emissions or meet renewable portfolio standards will be recoverable in rates 
we will continue to monitor and manage potential risks and opportunities associated with future greenhouse gas legislative or regulatory actions 
the majority of our generation and distribution facilities are located in the upper midwest region of the united states 
the same is true for the majority of our customers facilities 
the physical risks  if any  posed by climate change for these areas are not expected to be significant at this time 
ongoing evaluations will be conducted as more information on the extent of such physical changes becomes available 
federal health care reform since the health care and education reconciliation act of hcr was enacted  we have worked to create a long term strategy for its implementation

our focus is on continued compliance with the law many mandates  avoidance or reduction of adverse tax impacts  and cost management 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act the dodd frank act was signed into law in july significant rulings essential to its framework are now becoming effective for certain companies 
since some of these final rules are being challenged in court  it is difficult to predict how they will ultimately affect us 
certain provisions of the dodd frank act relating to derivatives could increase capital and or collateral requirements 
we continue to monitor developments related to this act and their potential impacts on our future financial results 
at this time  we are making the necessary system and process changes to comply with the known rules 
federal tax law changes in january  president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of this act extends bonus tax depreciation through for most capital expenditures 
this bonus tax depreciation extension is anticipated to generate future cash flows in excess of approximately million through in december  the national defense authorization act ndaa was enacted 
the most relevant provision of the ndaa was to retroactively eliminate the application of the tax normalization rule for cash grants taken by a regulated utility in lieu of investment tax credits or production tax credits 
prior to the enactment of ndaa  a regulated utility was required to amortize the grant in rates over the life of the renewable energy generating plant 
further  the allowed rate base on the generating plant could not be reduced by the unamortized grant balance during the life of the plant 
in  we elected to claim and subsequently received a million section grant for wps crane creek wind project in lieu of the production tax credit 
the cost of eliminating the prior production tax credit was recorded as a regulatory asset at december  therefore  we do not anticipate a significant financial impact as a result of this change 
illinois senate bill in february  the illinois senate introduced senate bill  the natural gas modernization  public safety and jobs bill 
this bill  if passed  would give illinois natural gas utilities greater regulatory certainty  allowing them to accelerate investment in natural gas infrastructure modernization 
it would establish a built in formula for setting rates  including a pre defined return on investment based on us treasury bond rates  and strict rate caps 
off balance sheet arrangements see note  guarantees  for information regarding guarantees 
critical accounting policies we have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our financial statements because their application requires significant judgment and reliance on estimations of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our management has discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
risk management activities we have entered into contracts that are accounted for as derivatives 
all derivative contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheets  unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception  which provides that recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements is not required until the settlement of the contracts 
changes in fair value  except effective portions of derivative instruments designated as hedges or qualifying for regulatory deferral  generally affect net income attributed to common shareholders at each financial reporting date until the contracts are ultimately settled 
we have based our valuations on observable inputs whenever possible 
however  at times  the valuation of certain derivative instruments requires the use of internally developed valuation techniques and or significant unobservable inputs 
these valuations require a significant amount of management judgment and are classified as level measurements in the fair value hierarchy 
of the total risk management assets on our balance sheets  million were classified as level measurements 
of the total risk management liabilities  million were classified as level measurements 
we believe these valuations represent the fair values of these instruments as of the reporting date  however  the actual amounts realized upon settlement of these instruments could vary materially from the reported amounts due to movements in market prices and changes in the liquidity of certain markets 
as a component of fair value determinations  we consider counterparty credit risk and our own credit risk 
changes in the underlying assumptions for the credit risk component of fair value at december   would have had the following effects change in risk components millions effect on fair value of net risk management liabilities at december  increase decrease decrease increase these hypothetical changes in fair value would impact current and long term assets and liabilities from risk management activities on the balance sheets and nonregulated revenues on the income statements 
goodwill impairment we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of april  no impairment was recorded as a result of these tests 
for all of our reporting units  the fair value calculated in step one of the test was greater than the carrying value 
the fair value was calculated using an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach 
for the income approach  we used internal forecasts to project cash flows 
any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty  and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the fair value of a reporting unit 
for the regulated reporting units  a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed 
an unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair value of these reporting units to decrease 
key assumptions used in the income approach included return on equity roe for the regulated reporting units  long term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period  and discount rates 
the discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach 
as interest rates rise  the calculated fair values will decrease 
the discount rate is determined based on the weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit  taking into account both the after tax cost of debt and cost of equity 
the terminal year roe for each utility is based on its current allowed roe adjusted for forecasted disallowed costs and expectations regarding the direction and magnitude of movements in interest rates 
the terminal growth rate is based on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area 
we used the guideline company method for the market approach 
this method uses metrics from similar publicly traded companies in the same industry to determine how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for an investment in a similar company 
we applied multiples derived from these guideline companies to the appropriate operating metric for the utility reporting units to determine indications of fair value 
the underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment test are made as of a point in time 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the test 
the fair values of nsg  the wps natural gas utility  integrys energy services  and itf reporting units exceeded the carrying values by a substantial amount 
based on these results  these reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
the fair values calculated in the first step of the test for mgu  merc  and pgl exceeded the carrying values by approximately 
due to the subjectivity of the assumptions and estimates underlying the impairment analyses  we cannot provide assurance that future analyses will not result in impairments 
as a result  we performed a sensitivity analysis on key assumptions for these reporting units 
the following table shows the change in each assumption  holding all other inputs constant  which would result in a fair value at or below carrying value  causing the applicable reporting unit to fail step one of the test 
change in key inputs in basis points mgu merc pgl discount rate terminal year return on equity terminal year growth rate n a even with a terminal year growth rate of  assuming all other inputs remained constant  pgl would still have passed the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
accrued unbilled revenues we accrue estimated amounts of revenues for services provided or energy delivered but not yet billed to customers 
estimated unbilled revenues are calculated using a variety of judgments and assumptions related to customer class  contracted rates  weather  and customer use 
significant changes in these judgments and assumptions could have a material impact on our results of operations 
at december   and  our unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
the amount of unbilled revenues can vary significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including seasonality  weather  customer use patterns  commodity prices  and customer mix 
pension and other postretirement benefits the costs of providing noncontributory defined benefit pension benefits and other postretirement benefits  described in note  employee benefit plans  are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions regarding future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels  and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plans  and earnings on plan assets 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and expected health care cost trends 
changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods 
we believe that such changes in costs would be recovered refunded at the regulated utility segments through the ratemaking process 
the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost 
each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only 
actuarial assumption millions  except percentages percentage point change in assumption impact on projected benefit obligation impact on pension cost discount rate discount rate rate of return on plan assets n a rate of return on plan assets n a the following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and the reported net periodic other postretirement benefit cost

the bonds are generally rated aa with a minimum amount outstanding of million 
from the hypothetical bond portfolios  a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans expected future benefit payments 
we establish our expected return on asset assumption based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns  as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios 
the assumed long term rate of return was in both and  and in for   and  the actual rates of return on pension plan assets  net of fees  were   and  respectively 
beginning in  the expected return on assets assumption for the plans is 
the determination of expected return on qualified plan assets is based on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
cumulative gains and losses in excess of of the greater of the pension or other postretirement benefit obligation or market related value are amortized over the average remaining future service to expected retirement ages 
changes in realized and unrealized investment gains and losses are recognized over the subsequent five years for plans sponsored by wps  while differences between actual investment returns and the expected return on plan assets are recognized over a five year period for pension plans sponsored by ibs and pellc 
because of this method  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are included in market related value 
in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered 
for more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and other postretirement benefits  see note  employee benefit plans 
regulatory accounting our natural gas and electric utility segments follow the guidance under the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc 
our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating these segments 
certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers  as authorized by our regulators 
future recovery of regulatory assets is not assured  and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness 
once approved  the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery period 
if recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer deemed probable  these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings 
management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  earnings at the natural gas and electric utility segments  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
the application of the regulated operations topic of the fasb asc would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our natural gas and electric utility segment operations no longer meet the criteria for application 
assets and liabilities recognized as a result of rate regulation would be written off as extraordinary items in income for the period in which the discontinuation occurred 
a write off of all our regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at december   would result in an decrease in total assets and a decrease in total liabilities 
the two largest regulatory assets at december   related to unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit costs and environmental remediation costs 
a write off of the unrecognized pension and other postretirement benefit related regulatory asset at december   would result in a decrease in total assets 
a write off of the regulatory asset related to environmental remediation costs at december   would result in a decrease in total assets 
see note  regulatory assets and liabilities  for more information 
income tax provision we are required to estimate income taxes for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements 
this process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheets 
we also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance  which is offset by an adjustment to the provision for income taxes in the income statements 
uncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations and the outcomes of tax audits and appeals requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates 
only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized 
unrecognized tax benefits are re evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information  including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets 
the assumptions involved are supported by historical data  reasonable projections  and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions 
significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note p  income taxes  and note  income taxes  for a discussion of accounting for income taxes 
impact of inflation our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the statements provide a reasonable  objective  and quantifiable statement of financial results  but generally do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
to the extent our regulated operations are not recovering the effects of inflation  they will file rate cases as necessary in the various jurisdictions in which they operate 
our nonregulated businesses include inflation in forecasted costs  which impacts product pricing 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have potential market risk exposure related to commodity price risk  interest rate risk  and equity return and principal preservation risk 
we are also exposed to other significant risks due to the nature of our subsidiaries businesses and the environment in which we operate 
we have risk management policies in place to monitor and assist in controlling these risks  and we use derivative and other instruments to manage some of these exposures  as further described below 
commodity price risk utilities prudent fuel and purchased power costs and capacity payments are recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms by uppco  and by the wholesale electric operations and michigan retail electric operations of wps 
prudently incurred costs of natural gas used by the natural gas utilities are also recovered from customers under one for one recovery mechanisms 
these recovery mechanisms greatly reduce commodity price risk for the utilities 
wps wisconsin retail electric operations do not have a one for one recovery mechanism for price fluctuations 
instead  a fuel window mechanism substantially mitigates this price risk 
to manage commodity price risk for their customers  the regulated utilities enter into fixed price contracts of various durations for the purchase and or sale of natural gas  fuel for electric generation  and electricity 
in addition  the electric operations of wps and uppco  and the natural gas operations of wps  pgl  nsg  and merc  employ risk management techniques  which include the use of derivative instruments such as swaps  futures  and options 
see note f  summary of significant accounting policies revenues and customer receivables  for more information 
integrys energy services integrys energy services seeks to reduce market price risk from its generation and energy supply portfolios through the use of various financial and physical instruments 
additionally  integrys energy services uses volume limits and stop loss limits as defined in its risk policy to limit its exposure to commodity price movements 
to measure commodity price risk exposure  integrys energy services employs a number of controls and processes  including a value at risk var analysis of its exposures 
the var amount represents an estimate of the potential change in fair value that could occur from changes in market factors  within a given confidence level  if an instrument or portfolio is held for a specified time period 
the var calculation is used to quantify exposure to market risk associated with its open commodity positions primarily natural gas and power positions 
the var calculation includes financial and physical commodity instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps  and options  as well as natural gas inventory  natural gas storage  and transportation contracts  to the extent such positions are significant 
the var calculation excludes the positions created by owning energy assets and associated coal  sulfur dioxide emission allowances  renewable energy credits  and other ancillary fuels 
additionally  financial transmission rights  certain electric ancillary services  and certain portions of long dated natural gas storage and transportation contracts are also excluded from the var calculation 
var is calculated using nondiscounted positions with a delta normal approximation based on a one day holding period and a confidence level  as well as a ten day holding period and a confidence level 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a one day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the var for integrys energy services portfolio at a confidence level and a ten day holding period is presented in the following table millions as of december average for months ended december high for months ended december low for months ended december the average  high  and low amounts were computed using the var amounts at each of the four quarter ends 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short term commercial paper borrowings and projected near term debt financing needs 
we manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
when it is advantageous to do so  we enter into long term fixed rate debt 
we may also enter into derivative financial instruments  such as swaps  to mitigate interest rate exposure 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
comparatively  based on the variable rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by million 
this sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates  with no other changes for the remainder of the period 
equity return and principal preservation risk we currently fund liabilities related to employee benefits through various external trust funds 
the trust funds are managed by numerous investment managers and hold investments primarily in debt and equity securities 
changes in the market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
declines in the equity markets or declines in interest rates may result in increased future costs for the plans and require additional contributions into the plans 
we monitor the trust fund portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against certain security indices 
most of the employee benefit costs relate to the regulated utilities 
as such  the majority of these costs are recovered in customers rates  reducing most of the equity return and principal preservation risk on these exposures 
also  the likelihood of an increase in the employee benefit obligations  which the investments must fund  has been partially mitigated as a result of certain employee groups no longer being eligible to participate in  or accumulate benefits in  certain pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
our defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires
