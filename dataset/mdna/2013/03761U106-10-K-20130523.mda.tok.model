overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
since then  and through march   we have raised approximately billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock 
subsequent to march  we raised an additional billion in net proceeds from an offering of common stock

table of contents merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 
as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euro interbank offered rate euribor  british pound sterling libor gbp libor  or the prime rate 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually and while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of our investments may include zero coupon and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
in addition  some of our investments provide for pik interest or dividends 
such amounts of accrued pik interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 

table of contents valuation of portfolio investments under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain secured debt  unsecured debt  and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we attempt to obtain market quotations from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise from a principal market maker or a primary market dealer or other independent pricing service 
we utilize mid market pricing as a practical expedient for fair value unless a different point within the range is more representative 
if and when market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  we typically utilize independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining fair value 
accordingly  such investments go through our multi step valuation process as described below 
in each case  our independent valuation firms consider observable market inputs together with significant unobservable inputs in arriving at their valuation recommendations for such level categorized assets 
debt investments with remaining maturities of days or less shall each be valued at cost with interest accrued or discount amortized to the date of maturity  unless such valuation  in the judgment of our investment adviser  does not represent fair value  in which case such investments shall be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
investments that are not publicly traded or whose market quotations are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our investment adviser  independent valuation firms are engaged by our board of directors to conduct independent appraisals by reviewing our investment adviser s preliminary valuations and then making their own independent assessment  the audit committee of the board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and the valuation prepared by the independent valuation firm and responds to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of our investment adviser  the applicable independent valuation firm  third party pricing services and the audit committee 
investments in all asset classes are valued utilizing a market approach  an income approach  or both approaches  as appropriate 
the market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities including a business 
the income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts for example  cash flows or earnings to a single present amount discounted 
the measurement is based on the value indicated by current market expectations about those future amounts 
in following these approaches  the types of factors that we may take into account in fair value pricing our investments include  as relevant available current market data  including relevant and applicable market trading and transaction comparables  applicable market yields and multiples  security covenants  call protection provisions  information rights  the nature and realizable value of any collateral  the portfolio company s ability to make payments  its earnings and discounted cash flows  the markets in which the portfolio company does business  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public  m a comparables  our principal market as the reporting entity and enterprise values  among other factors 
when readily available  broker 
table of contents quotations and or quotations provided by pricing services are considered in the valuation process of independent valuation firms 
for the fiscal year ended march   there was no change to the company s valuation techniques and related inputs considered in the valuation process 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by the company at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
revenue recognition the company records interest and dividend income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  on an accrual basis 
some of our loans and other investments  including certain preferred equity investments  may have contractual payment in kind pik interest or dividends 
pik interest and dividends computed at the contractual rate are accrued into income and reflected as receivable up to the capitalization date 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received 
pik generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
at the point the company believes pik is not expected to be realized  the pik investment will be placed on non accrual status 
when a pik investment is placed on non accrual status  the accrued  uncapitalized interest or dividends are reversed from the related receivable through interest or dividend income  respectively 
the company does not reverse previously capitalized pik interest or dividends 
upon capitalization  pik is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments 
pik investments on non accrual status are restored to accrual status if the company believes that pik is expected to be realized 
for the fiscal year ended march   accrued pik totaled million  on total investment income of million 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discounts are capitalized and amortized into income using the interest method or straight line  as applicable 
upon the prepayment of a loan  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and other investments as interest income when we receive such amounts 
structuring fees are recorded as other income when earned 
investments that are expected to pay regularly scheduled interest and or dividends in cash are generally placed on non accrual status when principal or interest dividend cash payments are past due days or more and or when it is no longer probable that principal or interest dividend cash payments will be collected 
such non accrual investments are restored to accrual status if past due principal and interest or dividends are paid in cash  and in management s judgment  are likely to continue timely payment of their remaining interest or dividend obligations 
interest or dividend cash payments received on non accrual designated investments may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously 
table of contents recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
results of operations results comparisons are for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march  investment income for the fiscal years ended march   and  gross investment income totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily driven by a smaller portfolio  on average with which to generate income 
this was partially offset by slightly higher yields on the debt portfolio 
also contributing to the decrease in gross investment income was lower non recurring income of million in fiscal year the decrease in gross investment income from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the size of the income producing portfolio as compared to the previous fiscal year and was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average portfolio yield as well as an increase in other income 
net expenses net expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and  of which million  million and million  respectively  were base management fees and performance based incentive fees and million  million and million  respectively  were interest and other debt expenses 
administrative services and other general and administrative expenses totaled million  million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and net expenses consist of base investment advisory and management fees  insurance expenses  administrative services fees  legal fees  directors fees  audit and tax services expenses  and other general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in net expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to lower interest and debt costs as a result of less debt outstanding  on average  during the fiscal year ended march   lower management and incentive fees as a result of the implementation of the fee waiver in fiscal coupled with a smaller asset base in which to generate management fees 
lastly  in fiscal there were million of non recurring expenses as compared to million of non recurring expense in fiscal the increase in net expenses from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in interest and other debt expenses as our net weighted average annual interest cost increased by approximately basis points 
this increase was due to the impact of fixed rate debt issuances 
additionally  during fiscal there were net non recurring general and administrative expenses that totaled over million 
there were no accrued excise tax expenses for the fiscal years ended march   and net investment income the company s net investment income totaled million  million and million  or  and on a per average share basis  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and net realized losses the company had investment sales and repayments totaling billion  billion and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended march   and net realized losses for the fiscal years 
table of contents ended march    and were million  million and million  respectively 
net realized losses incurred during fiscal year were primarily derived from the exits of select investments  specifically new omaha holdings equity  cengage learning acquisitions nd lien  and rbs holdings st lien which comprised approximately million of the net realized loss totals 
the realized losses incurred upon the exit of new omaha holdings equity and rbs holdings st lien reversed out million and million  respectively  of previously reported unrealized losses 
net realized losses incurred during fiscal year were primarily derived from the exits of select investments  specifically grand prix holdings  which accounted for over million of the realized loss totals  but also included playpower holdings  tl acquisitions and fsc holdings  among others 
the realized losses incurred upon the exit of these investments reversed out previously reported unrealized losses 
net realized losses incurred during fiscal year were primarily related to sales and restructurings of certain underperforming portfolio companies such as american safety razor  lvi devices and pacific crane maintenance company  various portfolio optimization measures  and our liquidity management strategy during the financial crisis early in the fiscal year 
net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  cash equivalents and foreign currencies for the fiscal years ended march   and net change in unrealized appreciation on the company s investments  cash equivalents  foreign currencies and other assets and liabilities totaled million  million and million  respectively 
driving the positive impact to unrealized appreciation was new omaha and ab acquisitions which were both exited in the fiscal year which resulted in the reversal of approximately million of previously recognized negative unrealized depreciation 
other significant contributors to the positive change in unrealized depreciation for the period were investments in aic credit opportunity fund  lvi services  penton business media holdings  llc and ceridian corporation 
offsetting the positive impact of these investments were select holdings in certain portfolio companies such as cengage  playpower  delta and garden fresh which resulted in negative unrealized depreciation during fiscal net unrealized appreciation for fiscal included the reclassification of over million of previously recognized unrealized depreciation on our investment in grand prix holdings to a realized loss 
this reclassification was offset by generally weaker capital market conditions as compared to the year ago period 
net unrealized appreciation for fiscal was primarily due to the recognition of realized losses which reversed unrealized depreciation  net changes in specific portfolio company fundamentals  and improving capital market conditions

the company also has investments in its portfolio that contain pik provisions 
pik investments offer issuers the option at each payment date of making payments in cash or in additional securities 
when additional securities are received  they typically have the same 
table of contents terms  including maturity dates and interest rates as the original securities issued 
on these payment dates  the company capitalizes the accrued interest or dividends receivable reflecting such amounts as the basis in the additional securities received 
pik generally becomes due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer 
in order to maintain the company s status as a ric  this non cash source of income must be paid out to stockholders annually in the form of dividends  even though the company has not yet collected the cash

the junior note of the trust owned by apollo fdc pays to apollo fdc all of the interest and other proceeds received by the trust on the fdc loan after satisfying the trust s obligations on the senior note 
the holder of the senior note has no recourse to apollo fdc  aic holdco or us with respect to any interest on  or principal of  the senior note 
however  if the value of the fdc loan held by the trust declines sufficiently  the investment would be unwound unless apollo fdc posts additional collateral for the benefit of the senior note 
consequently  the maximum exposure on this investment is the amount of our investment in the junior note and any additional collateral we determine to post 
during the fiscal year ended march  the trust sold  face value of the fdc loan

the following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively declared dividends fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we 
table of contents currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may in the future be limited in our ability to make distributions 
also  our revolving credit facility may limit our ability to declare dividends if we default under certain provisions or fail to satisfy certain other conditions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we may suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of the tax benefits available to us as a regulated investment company 
in addition  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance that becomes due at the end of the loan term  or the accrual of original issue or market discount 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may not be able to meet the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to obtain tax benefits as a regulated investment company 
with respect to the dividends to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
recent events the board of directors declared a dividend of per share for the first fiscal quarter of  payable on july  to stockholders of record as of june  on may   we issued million shares of our common stock at per share or per share net proceeds before estimated expenses  raising million of net proceeds 
apollo investment management  lp aim  our investment adviser  has agreed to waive the base management and incentive fees associated with the incremental shares issued in the offering through march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on floating libor and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our us mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
the company also has a revolving credit facility that is based on floating libor rates 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of march   a hypothetical one percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would decrease our earnings by approximately two cents per average share over the next twelve months 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of march   a hypothetical two percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by three cents per average share over the next twelve months 
assuming no changes to our balance sheet as of march   a hypothetical three percent increase in libor on our floating rate assets and liabilities would increase our earnings by approximately five cents per average share over the next twelve months 
however  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations from time to time by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act and applicable commodities laws 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
