we monitor our business performance using a number of measures that are not found in our consolidated financial statements 
these measures include the number of active dealers and lenders  active lender to dealership relationships in the dealertrack network  the number of transactions processed  average transaction price  transaction revenue per car sold  the number of subscribing dealers in the dealertrack network  and the average monthly subscription revenue per subscribing dealership 
we believe that improvements in these metrics will result in improvements in our financial performance over time 
we also view the acquisition and successful integration of acquired companies as important milestones in the growth of our business as these acquired companies bring new products to our customers and expand our technological capabilities 
we believe that successful acquisitions will also lead to improvements in our financial performance over time 
in the near term  however  the purchase accounting treatment of acquisitions can have a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations  as the depreciation and amortization expenses associated with acquired assets can be substantial for several years following each acquisition 
as a result  we monitor our non gaap financial measures and other business statistics as a measure of operating performance in addition to net income loss and the other measures included in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table consists of our non gaap financial measures and certain other business statistics that management continually monitors amounts in thousands are gaap net income loss  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  adjusted net income  capital expenditure data and transactions processed year ended december  gaap net income loss    non gaap financial measures and other business statistics adjusted ebitda previous presentation non gaap  adjusted ebitda non gaap    adjusted net income non gaap    capital expenditures  software and website development costs  active dealers in our us network as of end of the year  active lenders in our us network as of end of the year  active lender to dealer relationships as of end of the year transactions processed    average transaction price transaction revenue per car sold subscribing dealers in us and canada as of end of the year average monthly subscription revenue per subscribing dealership adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that represents gaap net income loss excluding interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  stock based compensation  contra revenue and certain items  as applicable  such as impairment charges  restructuring charges  impact of acquisition related activity including contingent consideration changes  compensation expense  basis difference amortization  and professional service fees  realized gains on sales of previously impaired securities  gains or losses on sales or disposals of subsidiaries and other assets  rebranding expense and certain other non recurring items 
in response to requests  and in consideration of comparable peer companies  stock based compensation expense is now excluded from the calculation of the adjusted ebitda non gaap measure 
this reduces the comparability with prior periods 
this non cash expense was included in presentations prior to the fourth quarter of and is captioned above as adjusted ebitda previous presentation non gaap 
adjusted net income is a non gaap financial measure that represents gaap net income loss excluding stock based compensation expense  the amortization of acquired identifiable intangibles  contra revenue  and certain items  as applicable  such as impairment charges  restructuring charges  impact of acquisition related activity including contingent consideration changes  compensation expense  basis difference amortization  and professional service fees  realized gains on sales of previously impaired securities  gains or losses on sales or disposals of subsidiaries and other assets  adjustments to deferred tax asset valuation allowances  non cash interest expense  rebranding expense and certain other non recurring items 
these adjustments to net income loss  which are shown before taxes  are adjusted for their tax impact at their applicable statutory rates 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are presented because management believes that they provide additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and are also frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of comparable companies 
we rely on adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income as primary measures to review and assess the operating performance of our company and management team in connection with our executive compensation plan incentive payments 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation from  or as a substitute for  analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income do not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  non cash compensation is and will remain a key element of our overall long term incentive compensation package  although we exclude it from adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda when evaluating our ongoing performance for a particular period  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income do not reflect the impact of certain charges or gains resulting from matters we consider not to be indicative of our ongoing operations  and other companies may calculate adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income only as supplements to our gaap results 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income are not measurements of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity

critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
our critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions about the ultimate outcome of future events 
our actual results may differ from these estimates if unforeseen events occur or should the assumptions used in the estimation process differ from actual results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or the services have been rendered  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our revenue is presented net of a provision for sales credits  which is estimated based on historical results  and established in the period in which services are provided

we offer both paper based and electronic based title services depending on state requirements 
customer contracts for title services are principally comprised of two elements title perfection confirmation and title administration 
for paper based titles  title perfection confirmation occurs upon the receipt of title and lien documentation supporting title perfection from the department of motor vehicles 
for electronic based titles  title perfection confirmation is achieved upon electronic acknowledgement that department of motor vehicles records reflect the customer as the lien holder 
for paper based titles  title administration services require us to physically hold  store and manually release the title 
for electronic based titles  title administration services require data storage 
the release of the electronic title can be accomplished by the lien holder and does not require manual action by us 
deliverables for paper and electronic title management arrangements are separated into more than one unit of accounting when i the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  ii delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially in our control  and iii relative selling price is determined 
based on the above criteria  paper and electronic based collateral management service revenue are separated into two units of accounting 
we recognize a portion of the paper based transaction fee upon receipt of title and lien documentation supporting title perfection from the department of motor vehicles 
for electronic based titles  we recognize a portion of the fee upon electronic acknowledgement that the department of motor vehicles records reflect the customer as the lien holder 
for paper based title services  amounts allocated to each unit of accounting are based upon vendor specific objective evidence 
for electronic based title services  amounts allocated to each unit of accounting are based upon estimated selling price  which is based upon an adjustment to the selling price of our individual paper based title services  when sold separately 
the adjustment to the selling price is due to the lower selling price of electronic based services compared to paper based services 
for customers in which we bill the entire transaction fee in advance  the title administration portion of the fee for both paper and electronic based titles is deferred and recognized over the title administration period  which is estimated at approximately three years 
this estimate is based upon a historical analysis of the average time period between the date of financing and the date of pay off

customer funds are maintained in separate bank accounts and are segregated from our operating cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the amount of the allowance account is based on historical experience and our analysis of the accounts receivable balances outstanding 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would result in an additional expense in the period that this determination was made 
software and website development costs and amortization we capitalize costs of materials  consultants  payroll and payroll related costs incurred by employees involved in developing internal use computer software 
costs incurred during the preliminary project and post implementation stages are charged to expense 
software and website development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives

amortization expense totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
amortization expense for the year ended december  included million of accelerated depreciation of certain technology assets due to the discontinuation of those projects 
goodwill we record as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment as well as whenever events or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step tests for potential goodwill impairment by comparing the fair value of our one reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step is to calculate and record an impairment loss to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of goodwill 
goodwill is required to be assessed at the operating segment or lower level 
we determined that the components of our one operating segment have similar economic characteristics  nature of products  distribution  shared resources and type of customer such that the components should be aggregated into a single reporting unit for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current estimated fair value of our reporting unit to the carrying value  including goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting unit by primarily using a market capitalization approach  and also looking at the outlook for the business 
the results of our most recent annual assessments performed on october  and did not indicate any impairment of our goodwill 
in each year  the fair value of our reporting unit was significantly in excess of the carrying value  which includes goodwill 
as of october   our market capitalization was approximately billion compared to our book value  including goodwill  of approximately million 
intangibles and long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets  including property and equipment and finite lived intangible assets for potential impairment on an individual asset basis or at the lowest level asset grouping for which cash flows can be separately identified 
intangible asset impairments are assessed whenever changes in circumstances could indicate that the carrying amounts of those productive assets exceed their projected undiscounted cash flows 
when it is determined that impairment exists  the related asset group is written down to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows and the estimated fair value of long lived assets involve significant estimates on the part of management 
in order to estimate the fair value of a long lived asset  we may engage a third party to assist with the valuation 
our process for assessing potential triggering events may include  but is not limited to  analysis of the following any sustained decline in our stock price below book value  results of our goodwill impairment test  sales and operating trends affecting products and groupings  the impact on current and future operating results related to industry statistics including fluctuation of lending relationships between financing sources and automobile dealers  actual and projected annual vehicle sales  and the number of dealers within our network  any losses of key acquired customer relationships  and changes to or obsolescence of acquired technology  data  and trademarks 
we also evaluate the remaining useful life of our long lived assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events or circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
senior convertible notes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  debt with conversion and other options  we separately account for the liability and equity components of our senior convertible notes 
the estimated fair value of the liability component is computed based on an assessment of the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not include a conversion feature 
the equity component  which is recognized as a debt discount and recorded in additional paid in capital  represents the difference between the gross proceeds from the issuance of the notes and the estimated fair value of the liability component at the date of issuance 
the debt discount is amortized over the expected life of a similar liability without the equity component 
the effective interest rate used to amortize the debt discount was based on our estimated non convertible borrowing rate of a similar liability without an equity component as of the date the notes were issued 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic  accounting for income taxes  which requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be reversed 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in  we recorded valuation allowances relating to cumulative us book losses  some of which were subsequently reversed as a result of acquisition and disposal activity 
uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet in accrued liabilities other 
interest and penalties  if any  related to tax positions taken in our tax returns are recorded in interest expense and general and administrative expenses  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
on january   the president of the united states signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of the act  which extends the us research and development tax credit for tax years and  as well as other provisions 
given the effective dates of the various provisions in the act  the act had no impact on our results and is expected to have an impact of approximately million to million of benefit in our tax provision related to the extension of the us research and development tax credit for tax years and stock based compensation expense and assumptions stock based compensation expense stock based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we currently have three types of stock based compensation awards stock options  restricted stock units and performance stock units 
there are no longer any restricted common stock awards outstanding 
the following summarizes stock based compensation expense recognized for the three years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  stock options    restricted stock units    performance stock units   restricted common stock  total stock based compensation expense   a summary of the unamortized stock based compensation expense and associated weighted average remaining amortization periods for stock options  restricted stock units and performance stock units is presented below weighted unamortized average stock based remaining compensation expense in thousands amortization period in years stock options  restricted stock units  performance stock units  stock based compensation assumptions and vesting requirements determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life  expected stock price volatility  and the number of awards that will be forfeited prior to the completion of the vesting requirements 
we use black scholes merton and binomial lattice based valuation pricing models to value our stock based awards 
expected life the expected life is determined based upon the experience of similar entities whose shares are publicly traded 
the expected life for stock based awards granted prior to december  were determined based on the simplified method  due to our limited public company history  except for options granted under the stock option exchange program soep which were determined by means of monte carlo simulations 
expected stock price volatility beginning in  we determine the expected volatility of any stock based awards we issue based on our historical volatility 
previously  due to our limited public company history  the expected volatility for stock based awards was determined using a time weighted average of our historical volatility and the expected volatility of similar entities whose common shares are publicly traded 
risk free interest rate and dividend yield the risk free interest rates used for all stock based awards granted were the actual us treasury zero coupon rates for bonds matching our expected life of an option on the date of grant 
the expected dividend yield is not applicable to our stock based award grants as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock 
we do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock  and we are currently limited in doing so pursuant to our credit facility 
option vesting requirements options granted generally vest over a period of four years three years for directors from the vesting commencement date  with the exception of options granted under the soep 
options granted generally expire seven years from the date of grant  except for stock options granted prior to july   which expire ten years from the date of grant 
options  to the extent unvested  expire on the date of termination of employment  and to the extent vested  generally expire at the end of the three month period following termination of employment  except in the case of executive officers  who under certain conditions have a twelve month period following termination of employment to exercise 
exchanged options granted under the soep vested after six months from the new grant date  after twelve months from the new grant date  and each month thereafter 
restricted stock unit vesting requirements restricted stock units granted are generally subject to an annual cliff vest over four years one year for directors from the vesting commencement date  with the exception of performance stock unit awards 
long term incentive plan ltip the ltip awards were earned upon the achievement of ebitda and market based targets for fiscal years  and and the grantee s continuous employment in active service until the final vest date  which was approximately three years from the grant date 
performance stock unit vesting requirements the performance stock unit awards are earned upon the achievement of adjusted net income and total shareholder return targets and the grantee s continuous employment in active service until the final vest date  which is approximately three years from the grant date 
fair value inputs the fair value of each share based award grant has been estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model with the following assumptions december  expected volatility expected dividend yield expected life in years risk free interest rate weighted average fair value of stock options granted weighted average fair value of restricted stock units granted the fair value of ani performance awards is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton valuation pricing model 
the fair value of tsr performance awards is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice based valuation pricing model 
the weighted average assumptions were as follows december  expected dividend yield risk free interest rate weighted average fair value of ani performance awards granted weighted average fair value of tsr performance awards granted application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
fair value measurements we have segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine fair value at the measurement date

as of december   it was uncertain whether we would be able to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months  as such we classified them as long term on our consolidated balance sheets 
due to the lack of observable market quotes we utilized valuation models that relied exclusively on level inputs including those that are based on expected cash flow streams  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
in june  we sold this security for approximately million and recorded a gain of approximately million in our consolidated statement of operations

prior to its exercise  the fair value of the warrant was estimated using a black scholes merton option pricing model 
in september  we exercised the warrant at a value of million based on an independent valuation approved by the board of directors of truecar

the value of the shares received upon net exercise is now part of our existing cost method investment in truecar 
a portion of the purchase price of ecarlist included contingent consideration that was payable in the first quarter of based upon the achievement of certain revenue targets in the fair value of the contingent consideration was determined based upon probability weighted revenue forecasts for the underlying period 
the contingent consideration was revalued each reporting period  until settled  with the resulting gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the revenue targets for were not met  and therefore no contingent consideration payments will be made 
we recorded a fair value adjustment in the amount of million of income for the year ended december  as a result of the decrease in the estimated settlement of the contingent consideration from the estimated amount as of december  in connection with our october  acquisition of clickmotive  a portion of the purchase price included contingent consideration that is payable in the first quarter of based upon the achievement of certain performance targets in the fair value of the contingent consideration is determined based upon probability weighted revenue forecasts for the underlying period 
the contingent consideration is revalued each reporting period  until settled  with the resulting gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of the contingent consideration as of the acquisition date was estimated at approximately million 
we estimated the fair value of the contingent consideration as of december  to be million and recorded expense of approximately million for the three months ended december  as a result of the increase in the contingent consideration liability 
the increase in contingent consideration includes the impact of an adjustment to the performance targets made subsequent to the close of the acquisition

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
effects of inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  receivables  long term investments  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of intangible assets and goodwill  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the prices of products and services we offer 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which requires that companies present either in a single note or parenthetically on the face of the financial statements  the effect of significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income based on its source and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification 
the guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued amended guidance that simplifies how entities may test indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
after an assessment of certain qualitative factors  if it is determined to be more likely than not that an indefinite lived asset is impaired  entities must perform the quantitative impairment test 
otherwise  the quantitative test is optional 
the amended guidance is effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   with early adoption permitted 
we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exposure we only have operations located in  and provide services to  customers in the united states and canada 
our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared with the canadian dollar 
our exposure is mitigated  in part  by the fact that we incur certain operating costs in the same foreign currency in which revenue is denominated 
the foreign currency exposure that does exist is limited by the fact that the majority of transactions are paid according to our standard payment terms  which are generally short term in nature 
interest rate exposure as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term marketable securities and million of long term marketable securities 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and thousand in short term marketable securities 
our investments are subject to interest rate and credit risk 
our general policy of investing in securities with a weighted average maturity of three months or less minimizes our interest and credit risk 
reductions in interest rates and changes in investments could materially impact our interest income and may impact future operating results 
an interest rate fluctuation of would have an effect of approximately million on consolidated operating results 
senior convertible notes on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes in a private placement 
the fair market value of senior convertible notes is subject to interest rate and market price risk due to the convertible feature of the notes and other factors 
generally the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the senior convertible notes may also increase as the market price of our stock rises and decrease as the market price of the stock falls 
interest rate and market value changes affect the fair market value of the senior convertible notes  and may affect the prices at which we would be able to repurchase such notes were we to do so 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in connection with the offering of the senior convertible notes  we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties 
the convertible note hedge transactions will cover  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  the number of shares of our common stock that will initially underlie the notes and are intended to reduce the potential dilutive impact of the conversion feature of the notes 
we have also entered into separate privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties 
the convertible note hedge will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the notes or the first day the notes are no longer outstanding 
we paid million for the convertible note hedges  which were recorded as a reduction to additional paid in capital 
the warrant transactions have an initial strike price of approximately per share  and may be settled in cash or shares of our common stock  at our option 
the warrant transactions will have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants 
proceeds received from the warrant transactions totaled million and were recorded as additional paid in capital 
the warrants expire at various dates during the convertible note hedge and warrants are both considered indexed to our common stock and classified as equity  therefore  the convertible note hedge and warrants are not accounted for as derivative instruments 
changes in the market value of our common stock impact the fair value of the convertible note hedge and warrants 
these changes do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations
