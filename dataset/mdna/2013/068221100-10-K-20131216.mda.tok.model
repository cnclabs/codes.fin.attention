item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates for further details 
a sufficient decline in oil or natural gas prices or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could result in future reductions of the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and an equivalent charge to earnings 
an increase in operating costs or a decline in our production level greater than anticipated could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
higher operating costs for our properties will directly decrease the amount of cash flow received by us 
electricity  supplies  and labor costs are a few of the operating costs that are susceptible to material fluctuation 
the need for significant repairs and maintenance of infrastructure may increase as our properties age 
a significant increase in operating costs could result in materially lower operating margin and cash flow 
the level of production from our existing properties may decline at rates greater than anticipated due to unforeseen circumstances  many of which are beyond our control 
a significant decline in our production could result in materially lower revenues and cash flow 
our operating results are affected by our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce 
our business depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of oil and natural gas gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities 
canadian federal and provincial  as well as united states federal and state  regulation of oil and natural gas production  processing and transportation  tax and energy policies  general economic conditions  and changes in supply and demand could adversely affect our ability to produce and market oil and natural gas 
if market factors change and inhibit the marketing of our production  overall production or realized prices may decline 
we are not the operator and have limited influence over the operations of the majority of our oil and natural gas properties 
we hold minority interests in the majority of our oil and natural gas properties 
as a result  we cannot control the pace of exploration or development  major decisions affecting the drilling of wells or the plan for development and production at non operated properties  although contract provisions give barnwell certain consent rights in some matters 
the operator s influence over these matters can affect the pace at which we incur capital expenditures 
additionally  as certain underlying joint venture data is not accessible to us  we depend on the operators at non operated properties to provide us with reliable accounting information 
we are dependent upon future discoveries or acquisitions of oil and natural gas to maintain our reserves 
we actively explore for oil and natural gas reserves 
however  future exploration and drilling results are uncertain and may involve substantial costs 
despite this uncertainty or potential cost  discoveries or acquisitions of additional reserves are needed to avoid a material decline in reserves and 
table of contents production 
as a result  future oil and natural gas reserves may be dependent on our success in exploiting existing properties and acquiring additional reserves 
if our access to capital becomes limited or unavailable  our ability to make the necessary capital investments to maintain or expand our oil and natural gas reserves will be impaired 
additionally  we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in developing additional reserves or acquiring additional reserves on terms that meet our investment objectives 
without these reserve additions  our reserves will deplete and as a consequence  either production from  or the average reserve life of  our properties will decline 
future oil and natural gas segment taxable income could vary significantly from estimates  which could in turn result in the inability to realize a portion or all of our deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance has been provided 
our deferred tax assets include liabilities accrued for books but not for tax under canadian tax law 
our ability to realize these deferred tax assets is based upon long term estimates of future canadian taxable income 
if new operational strategies and estimates of oil and natural gas drilling success do not materialize as planned and the levels and timing of future taxable income and liability payments differ sufficiently from our estimates  or if negative evidence of future realizability cannot be overcome despite our plans and estimates  some or all of these deferred tax assets would not be deemed realizable  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
actual reserves will vary from reserve estimates 
estimating reserves is inherently uncertain and the reserves estimation process involves significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the reserve data and standardized measures set forth herein are only estimates 
ultimately  actual reserves attributable to our properties will vary from estimates  and those variations may be material 
the estimation of reserves involves a number of factors and assumptions  including  among others oil and natural gas prices as prescribed by sec regulations  historical production from our wells compared with production rates from similar producing wells in the area  future commodity prices  production and development costs  royalties and capital expenditures  initial production rates  production decline rates  ultimate recovery of reserves  success of future development activities  marketability of production  effects of government regulation  and other government levies that may be imposed over the producing life of reserves 
if these factors  assumptions and prices prove to be inaccurate  actual results may vary materially from reserve estimates 

table of contents delays in business operations could adversely affect our distributions 
in addition to the usual delays in payment by purchasers of oil and natural gas to the operators of our properties  and the delays of those operators in remitting payment to us  payments between any of these parties may also be delayed by restrictions imposed by lenders  accounting delays  delays in the sale or delivery of products  delays in the connection of wells to a gathering system  blowouts or other accidents  adjustments for prior periods  recovery by the operator of expenses incurred in the operation of the properties  and the establishment by the operator of reserves for these expenses 
any of these delays could expose us to additional third party credit risks 
the industry in which we operate exposes us to potential liabilities that may not be covered by insurance 
our operations are subject to all of the risks associated with the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties  including the drilling of oil and natural gas wells  and the production and transportation of oil and natural gas 
these risks include encountering unexpected formations or pressures  premature declines of reservoirs  blow outs  equipment failures and other accidents  cratering  sour gas releases  uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas or well fluids  adverse weather conditions  pollution  other environmental risks  fires and spills 
a number of these risks could result in personal injury  loss of life  or environmental and other damage to our property or the property of others 
while we maintain reserves for anticipated liabilities and carry various levels of insurance  we could be affected by civil  criminal  regulatory or administrative actions  claims or proceedings 
we cannot fully protect against all of the risks listed above  nor are all of these risks insurable 
there is no assurance that any applicable insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability for the risks listed above 
we could face substantial losses if an event occurs for which we are not fully insured or are not indemnified against or a customer or insurer fails to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that insurance will continue to be available to cover any or all of these risks  or  even if available  that insurance premiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future  so as to make the cost of such insurance prohibitive 
we may incur material costs to comply with or as a result of health  safety  and environmental laws and regulations 
the oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation pursuant to local  provincial and federal legislation 
a violation of that legislation may result in the imposition of fines or the issuance of clean up orders 
legislation regulating the oil and natural gas industry may be changed to impose higher standards and potentially more costly obligations 
although we have recorded a provision in our financial statements relating to our estimated future environmental and reclamation obligations that we believe is reasonable  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to satisfy our actual future environmental and reclamation obligations 

table of contents for wells and facilities in the province of alberta  the alberta energy regulator aer tracks each licensee s deemed asset value and estimated abandonment and reclamation liabilities  and imposes a security deposit on operators whose estimated liabilities exceed their deemed asset value 
at september   the company had sufficient deemed asset value that no security deposit was due 
a requirement to provide security deposit funds to the aer in the future would result in the diversion of operating cash flows that could otherwise be used to fund oil and natural gas reserve replacement efforts  which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are not fully insured against certain environmental risks  either because such insurance is not available or because of high premium costs 
in particular  insurance against risks from environmental pollution occurring over time  as opposed to sudden and catastrophic damages  is not available on economically reasonable terms 
accordingly  any site reclamation or abandonment costs actually incurred in the ordinary course of business in a specific period could negatively impact our cash flow 
should we be unable to fully fund the cost of remedying an environmental problem  we might be required to suspend operations or enter into interim compliance measures pending completion of the required remedy 
we may have difficulty funding our planned capital expenditures  which could have an adverse effect on our business 
we make and expect to continue to make capital expenditures in our exploration and development projects 
without adequate capital resources  our drilling and other activities may be limited and our business  financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
we may not be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows or secure necessary financing on reasonable terms or at all and financing may not continue to be available to us under our existing financing arrangements 
if capital resources are unavailable  we may be forced to curtail our drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets under untimely or unfavorable terms 
any such curtailment or sale could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to domestic and foreign government regulation and other risks  particularly in canada and the united states 
barnwell s oil and natural gas operations are affected by political developments and laws and regulations  particularly in canada and the united states  such as restrictions on production  restrictions on imports and exports  the maintenance of specified reserves  tax increases and retroactive tax claims  expropriation of property  cancellation of contract rights  environmental protection controls  environmental compliance requirements and laws pertaining to workers health and safety 
further  the right to explore for and develop oil and natural gas on lands in alberta  saskatchewan and british columbia is controlled by the governments of each of those provinces 
changes in royalties and other terms of provincial leases  permits and reservations may have a substantial effect on barnwell s operations 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our operations in canada 
in fiscal  we derived of our revenues from operations in canada 

table of contents additionally  our ability to compete in the canadian oil and natural gas industry may be adversely affected by governmental regulations or other policies that favor the awarding of contracts to contractors in which canadian nationals have substantial ownership interests 
furthermore  we may face governmentally imposed restrictions or fees from time to time on the transfer of funds to the us government regulations control and often limit access to potential markets and impose extensive requirements concerning employee safety  environmental protection  pollution control and remediation of environmental contamination 
environmental regulations  in particular  prohibit access to some markets and make others less economical  increase equipment and personnel costs and often impose liability without regard to negligence or fault 
in addition  governmental regulations may discourage our customers activities  reducing demand for our products and services 
compliance with foreign tax and other laws may adversely affect our operations 
tax and other laws and regulations are not always interpreted consistently among local  regional and national authorities 
income tax laws  other legislation or government incentive programs relating to the oil and natural gas industry may in the future be changed or interpreted in a manner that adversely affects us and our stockholders 
it is also possible that in the future we will be subject to disputes concerning taxation and other matters in canada  including the manner in which we calculate our income for tax purposes  and these disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
unforeseen title defects may result in a loss of entitlement to production and reserves 
although we conduct title reviews in accordance with industry practice prior to any purchase of resource assets or property  such reviews do not guarantee that an unforeseen defect in the chain of title will not arise and defeat our title to the purchased assets 
if such a defect were to occur  our entitlement to the production from such purchased assets could be jeopardized 
risks related to land investment segment the market value of our real estate interests could decline  which may require write downs of the carrying value of our residential lots held for investment to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would negatively impact our results of operations 
the market value of residential lots can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing economic market conditions 
economic conditions in the united states and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains weak  which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and may deteriorate 
prevailing market conditions may significantly influence the market value of our residential parcels held for investment 
in the event of changes in economic or market conditions  we may have to sell the residential lots at lower margins or at a loss  or we may be required to write down the carrying value of our residential parcels held for investment 
such write downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our real estate business is concentrated in the state of hawaii 
as a result  our financial results are dependent on the economic growth and health of hawaii  particularly the island of hawaii 
barnwell s land investment segment is impacted by the condition of hawaii s real estate market  which is affected by hawaii s economy and hawaii s tourism industry  as well as the united 
table of contents states and world economies in general 
any future cash flows from barnwell s land development activities are subject to  among other factors  the level of real estate activity and prices  the demand for new housing and second homes on the island of hawaii  the rate of increase in the cost of building materials and labor  the introduction of building code modifications  changes to zoning laws  and the level of confidence in hawaii s economy 
receipt of future percentage of sales payments is dependent upon the developer s continued efforts to develop and market the property 
we are entitled to receive future payments based on a percentage of the sales prices of residential homes and lots within approximately acres in the kaupulehu area 
however  in order to collect such percentage of sales payments we are reliant upon an unaffiliated third party developer to continue to develop and market the homes and lots 
the receipt of future percentage of sales payments could be jeopardized if the developer fails to proceed with development and marketing of the property 
the occurrence of natural disasters in hawaii could adversely affect our business 
the occurrence of a natural disaster in hawaii such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  tsunamis  volcanic activity  droughts and floods  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop and sell properties or realize income from our projects 
the occurrence of a natural disaster could also cause property and flood insurance rates and deductibles to increase  which could reduce demand for our properties 
increases in interest rates  tightening of lending standards and decreases  limitations or restrictions in the availability of mortgage financing and other economic factors outside our control  such as consumer confidence and declines in employment levels could lead to slowed home sales  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
the united states residential mortgage market continues to experience disruption 
mortgage interest rates have been experiencing significant volatility and contributed to the challenging market conditions faced by us and the industry 
in addition  as a result of increased default rates and other factors  the willingness of many lenders to make home mortgage loans has decreased and lenders have tightened their lending standards 
the volatility in interest rates  the decrease in the willingness of lenders to make home mortgage loans  and the tightening of lending standards have made it more difficult for some potential buyers to finance the purchase of homes 
potential buyers may not be able to obtain acceptable financing to purchase residential lots within the kaupulehu area  leading to further declines in the market for homes 
even if potential buyers do not need financing  changes in interest rates and mortgage availability could make it harder for them to sell their existing homes to potential buyers who need financing 
any limitations or restrictions on the availability of mortgage financing or interest rate increases could reduce residential lot sales and adversely affect our sales  which would reduce our revenues 
our business is subject to extensive regulation which makes it difficult and expensive for us to conduct our operations 
we are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to land use and development and to environmental compliance and permitting obligations  including those related to the use  storage  discharge  emission  and disposal of hazardous materials 
in most cases  approval to develop requires multiple permits which involve a long  uncertain and costly regulatory process 
any failure to comply with these laws could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations that could adversely affect present and future operations  or jeopardize our ability to sell the leasehold interest currently held 

table of contents if required land use entitlements are not obtained at reasonable costs  or at all  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we hold the leasehold interest to approximately  acres of vacant land that is currently zoned conservation 
our success in selling this interest may be contingent upon obtaining the necessary reclassification from the state of hawaii land use commission and county of hawaii 
obtaining the necessary reclassification and ministerial approvals is often difficult  costly and may take several years  or more  to complete 
delays or failures to obtain the necessary reclassification approvals may adversely affect our financial results 
risks related to contract drilling segment demand for water well drilling and or pump installation is volatile 
a decrease in demand for our services could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
demand for services is highly dependent upon land development activities in the state of hawaii 
as also noted above  the real estate development industry is cyclical in nature and is particularly vulnerable to shifts in local  regional  and national economic conditions outside of our control such as interest rates  housing demand  population growth  employment levels and job growth and property taxes 
a decrease in water well drilling and or pump installation contracts will result in decreased revenues and operating results 
a significant portion of our contract drilling business is dependent on municipalities and a decline in municipal spending could adversely impact our business 
a significant portion of our contract drilling division revenues is derived from water and infrastructure contracts with governmental entities or agencies 
reduced tax revenues and governmental budgets may limit spending by local governments which in turn will affect the demand for our services 
material reductions in spending by a significant number of local governmental agencies could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial position 
our contract drilling operations face significant competition 
we face competition for our services from a variety of competitors 
many of our competitors utilize drilling rigs that drill as quickly as our equipment but require less labor 
our strategy is to compete based on pricing and to a lesser degree  quality of service 
if we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors  our financial results could be adversely affected 
the loss of or damage to key vendor  customer or sub contractor relationships would adversely affect our operations 
our contract drilling business is dependent on our relationships with key vendors  customers and subcontractors 
the loss of or damage to any of our key relationships could negatively affect our business 

table of contents awarding of contracts is dependent upon our ability to obtain contract bid and performance bonds from insurers 
although the company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining such bonds in the past  there can be no assurance that our ability to obtain such bonds will continue on the same basis as the past 
additionally  bonding insurance rates may increase and have an impact on our ability to win competitive bids  which could have a corresponding material impact on contract drilling operating results 
the contracts in our backlog are subject to change orders and cancellation 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contracts that have been started and new contracts not yet started 
our contracts are subject to change orders and cancellations  and such changes could adversely affect our operations 
the occurrence of natural disasters in hawaii could adversely affect our business 
the occurrence of a natural disaster in hawaii such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  tsunamis  volcanic activity  droughts and floods  could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete our contracts 
risks related to residential real estate segment the market value of our real estate interests could decline  which may require write downs of the carrying value of our real estate held for sale to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would negatively impact our results of operations 
economic conditions in the united states and the world have improved in recent years but the recovery remains weak  which puts continued pressure on consumer confidence for residential real estate 
these challenging market conditions are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and these conditions may deteriorate 
prevailing market conditions significantly influence the market value of our real estate held for sale 
if the market conditions deteriorate  we will be required to write down the carrying value of our real estate held for sale 
such write downs would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we are reliant upon the sale of our home as a source of liquidity 
if we are unable to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe  operating results  cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted 
barnwell currently owns one luxury residence that is available for sale in the lot a increment i area of kaupulehu  north kona  hawaii 
monthly payments of principal and interest on the related real estate loan are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of a change in the interest rate  the sale of the house or the sale of a residential parcel 
upon the sale of the house or a residential parcel  we will be required to make a principal payment in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel 
any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest will be due and payable on april  the timing and amount of residential home sales are unpredictable and may be sporadic 
the inability to sell the home within a reasonable timeframe will lead to additional interest  maintenance  property taxes and other holding costs 
furthermore  if estimated cash inflows from the home sale is less than current expectations  operating results  cash inflows and financial condition could be materially impacted 

table of contents severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters may impair the value of our real estate property 
severe weather and other natural conditions or disasters  such as  but not limited to  earthquakes  landslides  hurricanes  tornadoes  tsunamis  volcanic activity  droughts  floods  and heavy or prolonged rain  can negatively affect our operations by requiring us to perform potentially costly repairs to our projects 
further  these conditions can delay home closings  adversely affect the cost or availability of materials or labor  or impair the value of the property on a temporary or permanent basis 
to the extent our insurance is not adequate to cover business interruption losses or repair costs resulting from these events  our total earned revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
we may need financing to fund our future real estate development activities 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient financing  we may not be able to continue our residential real estate segment operations 
the real estate development industry is capital intensive and homebuilding requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
we will need to establish funding sources to finance any future land acquisition capital expenditures 
if such sources are not sufficient  we would seek additional capital in the form of debt or equity financing from a variety of potential sources  including additional bank financing  joint venture partner financing  and or securities offerings 
the amount and types of indebtedness which we may incur are limited by the terms of the agreements governing our existing debt 
in addition  the availability of borrowed funds to be utilized for land acquisition  development and construction may be greatly reduced  and the lending community may require increased amounts of equity to be invested in a project by borrowers in connection with both new loans and the extension of existing loans 
the failure to obtain sufficient capital to fund our planned capital and other expenditures could affect our plans to continue our residential real estate segment operations 
our operating results from homebuilding are expected to be variable 
due to the cyclical nature of the real estate development industry  we expect to experience variability in our future operating results on a quarterly and an annual basis 
factors expected to contribute to this variability include  among other things the timing of land acquisitions and permitting  the timing of home closings and land sales  our ability to continue to acquire additional land or options thereon on acceptable terms  and the condition of the real estate market and the general economy 
if the timing of land acquisitions  zoning or regulatory approvals is delayed it could result in a decrease in our revenues and earnings for the periods in which the delays occur and possibly subsequent periods 
a delay in home closings due to natural disasters  adverse weather or contractor availability would have a similar impact on revenues and earnings for the period in which the delays occur 
further  revenues may increase in subsequent periods over what would normally be expected as a result of increased home closings as the delays described above are resolved

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding of the consolidated balance sheets of barnwell industries  inc and subsidiaries collectively referred to herein as barnwell  we  our  us or the company as of september  and  and the related consolidated statements of operations  comprehensive loss  cash flows  and equity for the years ended september  and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management of barnwell to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires the company to make assumptions that are difficult or subjective about matters that were highly uncertain at the time that the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur in periods subsequent to the period in which the estimate was made  or use of different estimates that the company could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations 
the most critical accounting policies inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements are described below 
we continue to monitor our accounting policies to ensure proper application of current rules and regulations 
oil and natural gas properties full cost ceiling calculation and depletion policy description we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties under which we are required to conduct quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation  on the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the ceiling limitation is the sum of the discounted present value at  using average first day of the month prices during the month period ending in the reporting period on a constant basis  of barnwell s estimated future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and natural gas reserves  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves but excluding future cash outflows associated with settling asset retirement obligations  plus the cost of major development projects and unproven properties not subject to depletion  if any  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproven properties included in costs subject to depletion  less related income tax effects 
if net capitalized costs exceed this limit  the excess is expensed 
judgments and assumptions the estimate of our oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  historical data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial 
table of contents judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
our reserve estimates are prepared at least annually by independent petroleum reserve engineers and quarterly by internal personnel 
the passage of time provides more quantitative and qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the last three fiscal years  annual revisions to our reserve volume estimates have averaged of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  such revisions could result in a write down of oil and natural gas properties 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by at the end of fiscal  the ceiling limitation would have decreased approximately  before income taxes  which would have resulted in a  reduction of the carrying value of oil and gas properties before income taxes 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimated proved reserves are also a significant component of the quarterly calculation of depletion expense 
the lower the estimated reserves  the higher the depletion rate per unit of production 
conversely  the higher the estimated reserves  the lower the depletion rate per unit of production 
if reported reserve volumes were revised downward by as of the beginning of fiscal  depletion for fiscal would have increased by approximately  while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids reserves are the average first day of the month prices during the month period ending in the reporting period on a constant basis as prescribed by sec regulations 
additionally  the applicable discount rate that is used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves is mandated at 
costs included in future net revenues are determined in a similar manner 
as such  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on an assessment of future prices or costs 
real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels policy description real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
if an asset s fair value less costs to sell  based on estimated future cash flows  management estimates or market comparisons  is less than its carrying amount  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
judgments and assumptions real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are reviewed for possible impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable 
if the evaluation determines that the recorded value will not be recovered  the carrying value of real estate held for sale and investment in residential parcels are written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
this evaluation requires management to make assumptions and apply considerable judgment based on market conditions and comparable sales transactions 
changes in assumptions may require valuation adjustments that may materially impact the company s future operating results 

table of contents income taxes policy description income taxes are determined using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax impacts of differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income tax assets are routinely assessed for realizability 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
barnwell recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained by a taxing authority 
judgments and assumptions we make estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for each reporting period 
significant changes to these estimates could result in an increase or decrease in our tax provision in future periods 
we are also required to make judgments about the recoverability of deferred tax assets and when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance is provided 
we consider available positive and negative evidence when assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets including historic and estimated future taxable earnings and available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  changes in our business performance  unforeseen events  and changes in estimates of future taxable income could require a further increase in the valuation allowance or a reversal in the valuation allowance in future periods 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made  and the impact of these changes could be material 
in addition  barnwell operates within the us and canada and is subject to audit by taxing authorities in these jurisdictions 
barnwell records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits  and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
management evaluates its potential exposures from tax positions taken that have or could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result because taxing authorities may take positions that differ from those taken by management in the interpretation and application of statutes  regulations and rules 
management considers the possibility of alternative outcomes based upon past experience  previous actions by taxing authorities eg  actions taken in other jurisdictions and advice from tax experts 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings  either of which could be material 

table of contents management believes that barnwell s provision for uncertain tax positions is reasonable 
however  the ultimate resolution of tax treatments disputed by governmental authorities may adversely affect barnwell s current and deferred income taxes 
asset retirement obligation policy description barnwell records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
barnwell s estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of its oil and natural gas properties are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of oil and natural gas properties and depleted over the life of the related reserves 
when the assumptions used to estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change  a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the capitalized cost of asset retirements 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to oil and natural gas operating expense 
judgments and assumptions the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value in the period in which it is incurred along with a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related asset 
barnwell has estimated fair value by discounting the estimated future cash outflows required to settle abandonment and restoration liabilities 
the present value calculation includes numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the existence of liabilities  the amount and timing of cash outflows required to settle the liability  what constitutes adequate restoration  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  and consideration of changes in legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
abandonment and restoration cost estimates are determined in conjunction with barnwell s reserve engineers based on historical information regarding costs incurred to abandon and restore similar well sites  information regarding current market conditions and costs  and knowledge of subject well sites and properties 
the process of estimating the asset retirement obligation requires substantial judgment and use of estimates  resulting in imprecise determinations 
actual asset retirement obligations through the end of fiscal have not materially differed from our estimates 
however  because of the inherent imprecision of estimates as described above  there can be no assurance that material differences will not occur in the future 
a increase in accretion and depletion of the asset retirement obligation would have increased barnwell s fiscal expenses before taxes by approximately  overview barnwell is engaged in the following lines of business exploring for  developing  producing and selling oil and natural gas in canada oil and natural gas segment  investing in land interests in hawaii land investment segment  drilling wells and installing and repairing water pumping systems in hawaii contract drilling segment  and developing homes for sale in hawaii residential real estate segment 
oil and natural gas segment barnwell is involved in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties in canada where we initiate and participate in exploratory and developmental operations for oil and natural gas on properties in which we have an interest  and evaluate proposals by third parties with regard to participation in such exploratory and developmental operations elsewhere 

table of contents barnwell sells substantially all of its oil and natural gas liquids production under short term contracts with marketers of oil 
natural gas sold by barnwell is generally sold under short term contracts with prices indexed to market prices 
the price of natural gas  oil and natural gas liquids is freely negotiated between the buyers and sellers 
oil and natural gas prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control 
market prices for oil and natural gas products are dependent upon factors such as  but not limited to  changes in market supply and demand  which are impacted by overall economic activity  changes in weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  and output 
petroleum and natural gas prices are very difficult to predict and fluctuate significantly 
natural gas prices tend to be higher in the winter than in the summer due to increased demand  although this trend has become less pronounced due to the increased use of natural gas to generate electricity for air conditioning in the summer and increased natural gas storage capacity in north america 
oil and natural gas exploration  development and operating costs generally follow trends in product market prices  thus in times of higher product prices the cost of exploring  developing and operating the oil and natural gas properties will tend to escalate as well 
capital expenditures are required to fund the exploration  development  and production of oil and natural gas 
cash outlays for capital expenditures are largely discretionary  however  a minimum level of capital expenditures is required to replace depleting reserves 
due to the nature of oil and natural gas exploration and development  significant uncertainty exists as to the ultimate success of any drilling effort 
land investment segment the land investment segment is comprised of the following components barnwell owns a controlling interest in kaupulehu developments  a hawaii general partnership which owns interests in leasehold land at kaupulehu located approximately six miles north of the kona international airport in the north kona district of the island of hawaii  adjacent to hualalai resort at historic ka upulehu  between the queen kaahumanu highway and the pacific ocean 
kaupulehu developments interests include the following the right to receive payments from wb and wbkd  entities not affiliated with barnwell and its subsidiaries  resulting from the sale of lots and or residential units within approximately acres of the kaupulehu lot a area by wb and wbkd in two increments increment i and increment ii 
increment i is an area zoned for approximately single family lots and a beach club on the portion of the property bordering the pacific ocean  and is partially developed 
the purchasers of the single family lots will have the right to apply for membership in the kuki o golf and beach club  which is located adjacent to and south of the four seasons resort hualalai at historic ka upulehu 
increment ii is the remaining portion of the approximately acre property  is zoned for single family and multi family residential units and a golf course and clubhouse  and is not yet developed 
approximately  acres of vacant leasehold land zoned conservation in the kaupulehu lot c area located adjacent to the acre lot a described above 
barnwell owns an controlling interest in kaupulehu  a hawaii limited liability limited partnership 
kaupulehu owns two residential parcels in the kaupulehu area that are held for investment 

table of contents barnwell owns acquisition rights as to lots in the upland area of kaupulehu mauka lands situated between the queen kaahumanu highway and the mamalahoa highway 
the acquisition rights give barnwell the right to acquire residential lots  which may be developed on the mauka lands 
these leasehold lands are currently classified as agricultural by the state of hawaii and  accordingly  the developer of these lands  hualalai investors  will need to pursue both state and county of hawaii approvals for reclassification and rezoning to permit the development of residential lots and negotiate development terms 
due to heightened uncertainty regarding the likelihood of development of the mauka lands  and accordingly  the corresponding impact of such conditions on the company s ability to recover its investment in lot acquisition rights  the company wrote off its remaining investment in fiscal contract drilling segment barnwell drills water  water monitoring and geothermal wells and installs and repairs water pumping systems in hawaii 
contract drilling results are highly dependent upon the quantity  dollar value and timing of contracts awarded by governmental and private entities and can fluctuate significantly 
residential real estate segment barnwell  through its owned real estate joint venture  kaupulehu  constructs and sells luxury single family homes 
kaupulehu  in addition to the two parcels described above  owns a luxury residence in the kaupulehu area that is available for sale 
kaupulehu does not currently have any homes under construction 
investment in joint ventures kaupulehu investors  llc  a limited liability company owned by barnwell  owns passive minority interests in hualalai investors jv  llc and hualalai investors ii  llc hereinafter collectively referred to as hualalai investors  owners of hualalai resort  and a passive minority interest in kona village investors  llc  owner of kona village resort 
kona village resort sustained considerable damage as a result of the march tsunami and subsequently shut down indefinitely 
as such  barnwell wrote off its remaining investment in kona village investors  llc in fiscal due to uncertainty regarding the financial condition of hualalai investors and the duration of current economic conditions and the corresponding impact of such conditions on the company s ability to recover its investment within the company s estimated holding period  the company wrote off its remaining investment in hualalai investors in fiscal business environment our operations are located in canada and in the state of hawaii 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by macroeconomic conditions in those areas  as well as general economic conditions of the us domestic and world economies 
current global economic conditions differentiate recent times from years past  and sluggish demand continues to impact all of the company s segments in both hawaii and canada 
oil and natural gas segment historically  oil and natural gas prices have been highly volatile 
demand for natural gas also changes from season to season 

table of contents according to canada s national energy board  increased demand for natural gas in over levels resulted in a reduction of the unusually high amount of natural gas storage in north america and moderate increases in natural gas prices in from the year lows reached in continued downward pricing pressure for alberta natural gas is expected due to recent changes to pipeline transport rates and the discovery and availability of significant new quantities of natural gas from shale in north america 
concerns about slowing global economic growth continue to impact the demand for oil  which remains below pre recession levels 
during the first half of fiscal  the company realized lower prices for oil  as compared to fiscal  due to increasing north american oil production combined with pipeline congestion  due in part to new discoveries of oil  which increased the differential between the prices received for canadian oil as compared to global benchmark prices 
it is expected that this pricing differential for canadian oil will continue and that oil prices will remain volatile in the near term and will be affected by economic growth figures  political instability  supply  and pipeline capacity constraints 
in the absence of a sufficient increase in oil and natural gas prices or other sources of additional cash inflows  overall declines in production will result in reduced oil and natural gas segment discretionary cash flows  which in turn would result in reduced oil and natural gas capital spending by the company for fiscal this level of oil and natural gas capital expenditures is likely insufficient to maintain current production and reserve levels 
land investment and residential real estate segments kaupulehu s luxury home is a bedroom  bath ranch style home   square feet in size and is available for sale 
barnwell will have continuing cash outflows such as debt repayments  interest  maintenance  property taxes  and other holding costs until the home and lots held for investment are sold 
demand for residential homes and lots on the kona kohala coast has improved with increased resale volumes  however demand within the kaupulehu area remains slow 
furthermore  we do not control or determine when or if the remainder of increment i or increment ii will be developed 
if real estate activity in the kaupulehu area does not increase  our operating results  financial condition  liquidity and cash flows could be adversely affected 
contract drilling segment demand for water well drilling and or pump installation and repair services is volatile and dependent upon land development activities within the state of hawaii 
the most recent state of hawaii department of business  economic development and tourism forecast suggests growth in the construction industry with increases in both private development and government contracts 
management currently estimates that well drilling activity for fiscal will increase over fiscal based upon the value of contracts in backlog 
results of operations summary barnwell incurred a net loss for fiscal of  a  increase in operating results from a net loss of  in fiscal the following factors affected the results of operations for the current fiscal year as compared to the prior fiscal year 
table of contents a  decrease in reductions of the carrying value of assets in the current year as compared to the prior year 
the current year includes a  reduction in the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties whereas the prior year includes a  reduction in carrying values comprised of a  reduction of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties  a  write down of real estate held for sale  a  write off of our investment in joint ventures  and a  write off of our lot acquisition rights 
a  decrease in oil and natural gas segment operating profit  before reduction in carrying value of assets and taxes  primarily resulting from lower net production for all products  lower prices received for oil and natural gas liquids  partially offset by increased natural gas prices  and operating expenses incurred to remediate soil contamination issues 
an  increase in contract drilling operating results  before taxes  primarily resulting from higher contract margins on water well drilling activity in the current year and losses on certain pump installation and repair contracts due to unforeseen difficulties that were incurred in the prior year 
a  increase in general and administrative expenses 
general barnwell conducts operations in the us and canada 
consequently  barnwell is subject to foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses due to fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between the canadian and us dollar 
the average exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  and the exchange rate of the canadian dollar to the us dollar decreased at september   as compared to september  accordingly  the assets  liabilities  stockholders equity  and revenues and expenses of barnwell s subsidiaries operating in canada have been adjusted to reflect the change in the exchange rates 
barnwell s canadian dollar assets are greater than its canadian dollar liabilities  therefore  increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar to the us dollar generate other comprehensive income or loss  respectively 
other comprehensive income and losses are not included in net loss 
other comprehensive loss due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  for fiscal was  a  change from other comprehensive income due to foreign currency translation adjustments  net of taxes  of  in fiscal there were no taxes on other comprehensive loss income due to foreign currency translation adjustments in fiscal and due to a full valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets 
realized foreign currency transaction gains or losses were inconsequential in fiscal and 
table of contents the impact of fluctuations of the exchange rates between the canadian dollar and the us dollar may be material from period to period 
barnwell cannot accurately predict future fluctuations between canadian and us dollars 
oil and natural gas revenues selected operating statistics the following tables set forth barnwell s annual average prices per unit of production and annual net production volumes for fiscal as compared to fiscal production amounts reported are net of royalties 
annual average price per unit increase decrease natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls annual net production increase decrease units natural gas mcf oil bbls liquids bbls natural gas price per unit is net of pipeline charges 
oil and natural gas revenues decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  primarily due to and decreases in natural gas and natural gas liquids net production  respectively  largely as a result of natural declines in production  and also due to a scheduled dunvegan plant and pipeline maintenance shutdown during the current year  there was no such shutdown in the prior year 
in addition  net oil production decreased as compared to the prior year due to natural declines in production from existing wells  partially offset by new oil production from recent drilling activity 
declines in oil and natural gas liquids prices of and  respectively  as compared to the prior year were more than offset by an increase in natural gas prices  which increased as compared to the prior year 
the company continues to direct the majority of its exploration and development focus on oil rather than natural gas due to the poor outlook for natural gas prices  therefore it is likely that the company s natural gas and natural gas liquids production will continue to decline as its natural gas properties age 
oil and natural gas operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was due to lower production and  of equalization credits for previously allocated operating expenses received from non operated properties  partially offset by  of estimated costs incurred to remediate soil contamination from infrastructure issues at the dunvegan and wood river properties and increased repair and workover costs due to a scheduled dunvegan plant and pipeline maintenance shutdown whereas there was no such shutdown in the prior year 

table of contents sale of interest in leasehold land the following table summarizes the percentage of sales payment revenues received from wb year ended september  sale of interest in leasehold land proceeds fees revenues sale of interest in leasehold land  net wb sold one single family lot in phase ii of increment i during the year ended september  as compared to two single family lots in phase i of increment i during the year ended september  as of september   of the single family lots in phase i of increment i have been sold by wb 
forty two single family lots are planned for phase ii of increment i  for a total of single family lots planned for increment i 
the developer began marketing some of the single family lots in phase ii of increment i in  and as of september   one lot has been sold 
the company cannot predict when or if wb will complete the remaining single family lots in phase ii of increment i and there is no assurance with regard to the amounts of future sales from increment i 
in november  kaupulehu developments received a percentage of sales payment totaling  from the sale of one lot within phase i of increment i 
financial results from the receipt of this payment will be reflected in barnwell s quarter ending december  on november   barnwell  through a wholly owned subsidiary  entered into two limited liability limited partnerships  kd kona lllp and kkm makai  lllp  and indirectly acquired interests in wb kukio resorts  llc  wb maniniowali  llc  and wb kaupulehu  llc for  these entities own certain real estate and development rights interests in the kukio  maniniowali  and kaupulehu portions of kukio resort  a private residential community on the kona coast of the big island of hawaii 
wb kaupulehu  llc  which is comprised of wb and wbkd  is the developer of kaupulehu lot a increments i and ii  the area in which barnwell has interests in percentage of sales payments 
the limited liability limited partnership agreements provide for a priority return of barnwell s investment prior to profit distributions 
barnwell  through affiliated entities  borrowed approximately  under a new bank loan to partially fund the acquisition  and barnwell expects that it will pay approximately  in the forthcoming months to fund the remainder of the acquisition 
the bank loan matures in november  with an option to extend one year  and accrues interest for the first year at the federal home loan bank s fixed rate plus and resets annually thereafter 
principal payments are due on the receipt of percentage of sales payments from the sale of lots within kaupulehu lot a increments i and ii  upon the sale of barnwell s real estate held for sale and two residential parcels  and on receipt of cash distributions from the entities noted above 
barnwell is a guarantor of the loan 

table of contents as a result of this transaction  whereas barnwell was not affiliated with the aforementioned entities prior to this transaction  henceforth barnwell will have an ownership interest and affiliation with these entities 
this transaction will be reflected in barnwell s quarter ending december  contract drilling contract drilling revenues and costs are associated with well drilling and water pump installation  replacement and repair in hawaii 
contract drilling revenues remained consistent at  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  and contract drilling costs decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the contract drilling segment generated a  operating loss before general and administrative expenses during fiscal  an increase in operating results of  as compared to an operating loss before general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal the increase in operating results was primarily due to higher contract margins on water well drilling activity in the current year as compared to the prior year and because prior year results were impacted by unforeseen difficulties on certain pump installation and repair contracts 
at september   there was a backlog of three well drilling and eight pump installation and repair contracts  of which two well drilling and five pump installation and repair contracts were in progress as of september  the backlog of contract drilling revenues as of december  was approximately  of the contracts in backlog at december   approximately  is expected to be recognized as revenue in fiscal year contract drilling revenues and costs are not seasonal in nature  but can fluctuate significantly based on the awarding and timing of contracts  which are determined by contract drilling customer demand 
there has been significant volatility in demand for water well drilling contracts in recent years due largely to the impact of the recession and continuing weak economic conditions on both private real estate development and governmental capital improvement budgets 
this has generally led to increased competition for available contracts and lower margins on awarded contracts 
the company is unable to predict the near term and long term availability of water well drilling and pump installation and repair contracts as a result of this volatility in demand 
residential real estate revenues and expenses during the quarter ended june   one of the luxury residences was sold for  the carrying value of the home sold and costs related to the sale totaled  resulting in a nominal loss 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the increase was primarily due to  in severance payments and  in legal and executive search fees related to the resignation of the previous and hiring of a new president of our calgary  canada based oil and natural gas subsidiary 
also contributing to the increase was a  decrease in administrative expense reimbursements from oil and natural gas joint venture partners 
the increases were partially offset by an  decrease in retirement plans expense 

table of contents depletion  depreciation  and amortization depletion  depreciation and amortization decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in net production and a decrease in the depletion rate 
the decrease in the depletion rate for the current year was due to the impact of the reductions in the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties at september   december  and march   partially offset by increases in barnwell s costs of finding and developing proven reserves and the drilling of unsuccessful wells 
reduction of carrying value of assets during fiscal years and  barnwell reduced the carrying value of certain assets 
a breakdown of the reduction of the carrying value of assets as reported in the consolidated statements of operations is as follows year ended september  oil and natural gas properties real estate held for sale investment in joint ventures lot acquisition rights mauka lands total reduction of carrying value of assets under the full cost method of accounting  the company performs quarterly oil and natural gas ceiling test calculations 
barnwell s net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling limitations at march   december  and september  as such  barnwell reduced the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties by  and  during the years ended september  and  respectively 
changes in the month rolling average first day of the month prices for oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices  the value of reserve additions as compared to the amount of capital expenditures to obtain them  and changes in production rates and estimated levels of reserves  future development costs and the market value of unproved properties  impact the determination of the maximum carrying value of oil and natural gas properties 
the company may be required to record reductions in the carrying value of its oil and natural gas properties in the future  however  the company is unable to estimate a range of the amount of any potential future reduction in carrying value as variables that impact the ceiling limitation are dependent upon future prices and actual results of activity 
in fiscal  barnwell recorded a  reduction in the carrying value of its real estate held for sale to reflect a decline in the estimated market value 
no such reduction was necessary during fiscal due to uncertainty regarding the financial condition of the joint venture entities in which the company has passive interests and the duration of current economic conditions and the corresponding impact of such conditions on the company s ability to recover its investment within the company s currently estimated holding period  the company wrote off its remaining  investment in joint ventures in fiscal as management concluded that there was an other than temporary impairment of these investments 

table of contents due to heightened uncertainty regarding the likelihood of development of the mauka lands  and accordingly  the corresponding impact of such conditions on the company s ability to recover its investment in lot acquisition rights  the company wrote off its remaining  investment in lot acquisition rights in fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal  primarily due to lower outstanding loan balances and interest rates 
income taxes the components of loss before income taxes  after adjusting the loss for non controlling interests  are as follows year ended september  united states canada barnwell s effective consolidated income tax rate for fiscal  after adjusting loss before income taxes for non controlling interests  was  as compared to for fiscal consolidated taxes do not bear a customary relationship to pretax losses due primarily to the fact that canadian income taxes are not sheltered by us source losses  canadian income taxes are not estimated to have a current or future benefit as foreign tax credits or deductions for us tax purposes  and us consolidated net operating losses are not estimated to have any future us tax benefit prior to expiration 
included in the income tax benefit for fiscal is a  benefit from lapsing of the statute of limitations and related accrued interest for uncertain tax positions related to canadian income taxes 
there is no such benefit included in the income tax benefit for fiscal the canada revenue agency is currently examining the company s canadian federal income tax returns for fiscal and net loss attributable to non controlling interests earnings and losses attributable to non controlling interests represent the non controlling interests share of revenues and expenses related to the various partnerships and joint ventures in which barnwell has interests 
net loss attributable to non controlling interests totaled  in fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the  change is due primarily to impacts to non controlling interests of prior year write downs of barnwell s assets  as compared to the current year 

table of contents inflation the effect of inflation on barnwell has generally been to increase its cost of operations  interest cost as a substantial portion of barnwell s debt is at variable short term rates of interest which tend to increase as inflation increases  general and administrative costs and direct costs associated with oil and natural gas production and contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas prices realized by barnwell are essentially determined by world prices for oil and western canadian midwestern us prices for natural gas

liquidity and capital resources barnwell s primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand  cash flows from operations  land investment segment proceeds and available credit 
at september   barnwell had  in cash and cash equivalents   in working capital  and  of available credit under its credit facility with its canadian bank 
cash flows cash flows provided by operations totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  for the same period in fiscal the  decrease was primarily due to  of proceeds from the sale of real estate in the prior year period and lower oil and natural gas segment operating results in the current year 
net cash used in investing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  for the same period in fiscal the  decrease was primarily due to a  decrease in cash outflows for capital expenditures  primarily oil and natural gas  due to differences in the timing of disbursements for capital projects 
cash flows used in financing activities totaled  for fiscal  as compared to  for fiscal the  decrease in cash outflows was primarily due to decreased net debt repayments as the prior year period included a pay down in debt resulting from the sale of one luxury residence in june credit arrangements in march  barnwell s credit facility at royal bank of canada was renewed through april for  canadian dollars  unchanged from the prior year amount  or us  at the september  exchange rate of 
borrowings under this facility were us  and unused credit available under this facility was us  at september  the interest rate on the facility at september  was 
the facility is available in us dollars at libor plus  at the royal bank of canada s us base rate plus  or in canadian dollars at the royal bank of canada s prime rate plus 
a standby fee of per annum is charged on the unused facility balance 

table of contents barnwell  together with its owned real estate joint venture  kaupulehu  has a non revolving real estate loan with a hawaii bank that terminates on april  principal and interest are paid monthly and are determined based on a loan amortization schedule 
monthly payments of principal and interest are due on the first day of each month and will change as a result of an annual change in the interest rate  the sale of a house or the sale of a residential parcel 
the interest rate adjusts each april for the remaining term of the loan to the lender s then prevailing interest rate for similarly priced commercial mortgage loans or a floating rate equal to the lender s base rate 
the interest rate at september  was 
any unpaid principal balance and accrued interest will be due and payable on april  the loan is collateralized by  among other things  a first mortgage on kaupulehu s lots together with all improvements thereon 
kaupulehu will be required to make a principal payment upon the sale of a house or a residential parcel in the amount of the net sales proceeds of the house or residential parcel  the loan agreement defines net sales proceeds as the gross sales proceeds for the house or residential parcel  less reasonable commissions and normal closing costs 
the non revolving real estate loan agreement contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants including a consolidated debt service coverage ratio of not less than to and a consolidated total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio not to exceed to oil and natural gas capital expenditures barnwell s oil and natural gas capital expenditures  including accrued capital expenditures and excluding additions and revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations  increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal during the year ended september   barnwell participated in the drilling of seven gross net development wells in canada  of which six gross net appear to be successful while one gross net was not successful  and one gross net exploratory well in canada  which was not successful 
barnwell initiated two gross net of these wells during fiscal barnwell replaced of oil production including natural gas liquids and of natural gas production during fiscal  as compared to and  respectively  during fiscal of the  total oil and natural gas properties investments for fiscal   was for acquisition of oil and natural gas leases   was for exploration costs and  was for development of oil and natural gas properties 
the following table sets forth the gross and net numbers of oil and natural gas wells barnwell participated in drilling for the last two fiscal years gross net gross net exploratory oil and natural gas wells development oil and natural gas wells successful oil and natural gas wells unsuccessful oil and natural gas wells barnwell estimates that oil and natural gas capital expenditures for fiscal will range from  to  this estimated amount may increase or decrease as dictated by cash flows and management s assessment of the oil and natural gas environment and prospects 

table of contents other considerations we believe our sources of funds such as current cash balances  future operating cash flows  land investment segment proceeds  and available credit will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  planned future capital expenditures  and scheduled debt repayments and related interest 
however  in the event oil and natural gas prices and production  land investment segment proceeds  and residential real estate home sale proceeds are less than current expectations  barnwell s canadian revolving credit facility is reduced below the current level of borrowings under the facility upon the april review  and or we fall short of our key financial debt covenants for our real estate loan and are required to repay all or a portion of our loan borrowings earlier than anticipated  we will be faced with reduced cash inflows and or higher cash outflows than expected  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity  cash flows and financial condition 
absent a sufficient increase in natural gas and or oil prices  it is unlikely that future oil and natural gas operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund the capital expenditure levels necessary to maintain current production and reserve levels 
as such  the near term and longer term outlook for sources and uses of funds and oil and natural gas capital resources remains highly dependent on the factors noted above 
in the event our liquidity and capital resources are not sufficient to fund our future cash needs  the company will need to obtain alternative terms or sources of financing or liquidate investments and or operating assets to make any required cash outflows 
events and circumstances that lead to results that significantly differ from management s expectations could have a material adverse effect on our operations  liquidity  cash flows  and financial condition
