overview introduction novavax  inc  a delaware corporation novavax  the company  we  or us  is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing recombinant protein nanoparticle vaccines to address a broad range of infectious diseases 
our technology platform is based on proprietary recombinant vaccine technology that includes vlps and recombinant protein micelle vaccines combined with a single use bioprocessing production system 
our vaccine candidates are genetically engineered three dimensional nanostructures that incorporate immunologically important recombinant proteins 
our product pipeline targets a variety of infectious diseases and our vaccine candidates are currently in or have completed clinical trials that target seasonal influenza  pandemic hn influenza and rsv 
cpl biologicals private limited the jv  which is owned by us and by cadila  was established to develop and manufacture certain vaccine candidates  biogeneric products and diagnostic products for the territory of india 
the jv operates a state of the art manufacturing facility for the production of influenza vaccine and other vaccine candidates 
the jv is actively developing a number of vaccine candidates that were genetically engineered by novavax 
the jv s seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza candidates began phase i clinical trials in also in  the jv formed a new collaboration to develop a novel malaria vaccine in india with the international centre for genetic engineering and biotechnology 
the jv s rabies vaccine candidate is expected to begin a phase i clinical trial in india in we continue to account for our investment in the jv using the equity method 
since the carrying value of our initial investment was nominal and there is no guarantee or commitment to provide future funding  we have not recorded nor do we expect to record losses related to this investment in the future 
a current summary of our significant research and development programs and status of development follows program development phase collaborator seasonal quadrivalent influenza phase ii hhs barda lgls pandemic hn influenza phase i hhs barda lgls rsv phase ii path seasonal trivalent influenza phase i jv pandemic hn influenza phase i jv rabies pre clinical jv path is collaborating with us on a phase ii clinical trial to develop our rsv vaccine to protect newborn infants in low resource countries from rsv through maternal immunization 
influenza the fda has published criteria for granting accelerated approval of a bla for a new seasonal influenza vaccine 
under this guidance  developers that can demonstrate results that meet or exceed certain specified endpoint criteria in their clinical trials may  at the fda s decision  be granted a license to market prior to conducting a traditional efficacy clinical trial 
in adult populations under years of age  these criteria are based on demonstration of seroconversion rates the proportion of subjects with a four fold rise in hai titers or attaining titers of from a negative baseline and seroprotection rates the proportion of subjects with hai titers post vaccination that are and  respectively  at the lower bound of the confidence interval 
accelerated approval may be available as long as there is a shortage of seasonal influenza vaccine relative to the total population recommended to receive the vaccine  a situation that persists 
the fda expects that developers seeking accelerated approval of a bla will diligently conduct postmarketing efficacy studies 
novavax continues to use and reference these accelerated approval seroconversion and seroprotection endpoints in developing its influenza vaccine candidates 
the fda has articulated the same immunogenicity criteria for accelerated approval of vaccines that address potential pandemic influenza strains 
because a controlled efficacy clinical trial of a pandemic vaccine candidate is not logistically or ethically possible  vaccine developers seeking accelerated approval will be required to provide evidence that a seasonal vaccine made by the same manufacturing process is efficacious 
thus  the demonstration of efficacy with a seasonal vaccine product provides a key link between the seasonal and pandemic programs 
seasonal influenza vaccine the cdc recommends that all persons aged six months and older should be vaccinated annually against seasonal influenza 
in conjunction with these universal recommendations  attention from the influenza hn pandemic has increased public health awareness of the importance of seasonal influenza vaccination  the market for which is expected to continue to grow worldwide in both developed and developing global markets 
in the coming years  many seasonal influenza vaccines are expected to be produced in a quadrivalent formulation four influenza strains  two influenza a strains and two influenza b strains  as opposed to the current trivalent formulation two influenza a strains and one influenza b strain 
with two distinct lineages of influenza b viruses circulating  governmental health authorities have advocated for the addition of a second influenza b strain to provide added coverage 
current estimates for seasonal influenza vaccines growth in the top seven markets us  japan  france  germany  italy  spain and uk  show potential growth from the current market of approximately billion to billion over the next ten years 
recombinant seasonal influenza vaccines  like the candidate we are developing  have an important advantage  once licensed for commercial sale  large quantities of vaccine can be quickly and cost effectively manufactured without the use of either the live influenza virus or eggs 
top line data from our most recent phase ii clinical trial for our quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate were announced in july in that clinical trial  our quadrivalent vlp vaccine candidate demonstrated immunogenicity against all four viral strains based on hai responses at day  and was also well tolerated with no vaccine related serious adverse events observed and had acceptable reactogenicity 
our vaccine candidate met the fda accelerated approval seroprotection rates criterion for all four viral strains 
the potential to fulfill the seroconversion rates criterion was demonstrated for three of the four viral strains 
the fourth strain  b brisbane  despite fulfilling the seroprotection criterion  failed to demonstrate a satisfactory seroconversion rate 
our activities with respect to our seasonal influenza vaccine candidate have been  and are  focused on identifying the manufacturing process to ensure consistent and enhanced immune responses in all strains 
over the last six months we ve made significant progress and expect to finalize our manufacturing process by mid year during the second half of  we expect to begin manufacturing product for our next phase ii clinical trial 
pandemic hn influenza vaccine in the aftermath of the hn influenza pandemic  recognition of the potential devastation of a human influenza pandemic remains a key priority with both governmental health authorities and influenza vaccine manufacturers 
in the us alone  the hn pandemic led to the production of approximately million doses of monovalent single strain vaccine 
public health awareness and government preparedness for the next potential influenza pandemic is driving development of vaccines that can be quickly manufactured against a potentially threatening influenza strain 
industry and health experts have focused attention on developing a monovalent hn influenza vaccine as a potential key defense of the next pandemic threat 
during  we made significant progress in the development of our pandemic hn influenza vaccine candidate 
in may  we launched two phase i clinical trials of our pandemic hn vaccine candidate in combination with two different adjuvants  both of which are designed to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines at lower doses and thus provide antigen dose sparing 
these clinical trials evaluated the safety and tolerability of the vaccines and the ability of vlp vaccine antigens with and without adjuvants to generate antibody levels that we believe fulfill the fda s criteria for accelerated approval  and the ability of these vaccines to provide an expanded number of doses  with possible cross protection against other virus strains to the us population 
in october  we reported positive results from these clinical trials with top line data demonstrating safety and immunogenicity of varying dose levels of the vaccine  with and without adjuvant  and further demonstrating statistically significant robust adjuvant effects on immune response 
notably  our unadjuvanted vaccine candidate elicited hai titers in of subjects at a dose of g 
this response would fulfill the fda s influenza criteria for accelerated approval of a bla as further described under the heading influenza above 
hhs barda contract for recombinant influenza vaccines hhs barda awarded us a contract in february  which funds the development of both our seasonal and pandemic hn influenza vaccine candidates 
the contract  valued at million for the first three year base period and million for an hhs barda optional two year period  is a cost plus fixed fee contract in which hhs barda reimburses us for allowable direct contract costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs and a fixed fee earned in the ongoing clinical development and product scale up of our multivalent seasonal and monovalent pandemic hn influenza vaccines 
we recognized revenue of approximately million in  and have recognized approximately million in revenue since the inception of the contract in in december  hhs barda completed a contractually defined ipr of our contract 
this ipr was conducted by an inter governmental agency panel of experts from government agencies including hhs barda  fda  cdc and the national institutes of health  who provided input on our progress during the contract base period and plans for further development  including both near term process development and manufacturing activities and longer term clinical efforts 
hhs barda subsequently notified us in january that the milestone decision has been made to continue to support our vaccine advanced development contract 
under certain circumstances  hhs barda reimbursements may be delayed or even potentially withheld 
in march  we decided to conduct a phase ii clinical trial of our quadrivalent influenza vaccine candidate the trial under our existing us investigational new drug application ind for our trivalent seasonal influenza vaccine candidate as opposed to waiting to conduct this clinical trial under a new ind for our quadrivalent vaccine candidate quadrivalent ind 
based on our discussions with hhs barda in  the outside clinical trial costs for the trial may only be submitted for reimbursement to hhs barda and recorded as revenue by us after we submit the clinical trial data in a future quadrivalent ind 
the filing of the quadrivalent ind is expected shortly before we initiate the next phase ii dose confirmatory clinical trial  which has been delayed due to the development activity associated with improving the seroconversion response of one of the four strains 
the outside clinical trial costs of the trial are approximately million in total  of which million was incurred through december  these costs have been recorded as an expense and are included in cost of government contracts revenue 
lgls license agreement in february  we entered into a license agreement with lgls that allows lgls to use our technology to develop and commercially sell our influenza vaccines in south korea and certain other emerging market countries 
lgls received an exclusive license to our influenza vlp technology in south korea and a non exclusive license in the other specified countries 
at its own cost  lgls is responsible for funding its clinical development of the influenza vlp vaccines and completing a manufacturing facility in south korea 
we received an upfront payment and may receive reimbursements of certain development and product costs  payments related to the achievement of certain milestones and royalty payments at a rate of from lgls s future commercial sales of influenza vlp vaccines  which royalty rate is subject to reduction if certain timelines for regulatory licensure are not met 
respiratory syncytial virus rsv rsv is a widespread disease that causes infections of the lower respiratory tract 
while rsv affects persons of all ages  it acutely impacts infants  young children  the elderly  and others with compromised immune systems 
current estimates indicate that rsv is responsible for over million new acute lower respiratory infection episodes and between  and  deaths in children under five years old 
in the us  nearly all children become infected with rsv before they are two years old  it has been associated with of hospitalizations and of office visits for acute respiratory infection in young children 
who estimates that the global disease burden for rsv is million cases 
because there is no approved prophylactic vaccine  the unmet need of an rsv vaccine has the potential to protect millions of patients from this far reaching disease 
we are developing a vaccine candidate to prevent rsv and are looking at susceptible target populations that include the elderly  young children and newborns who may receive protection through antibodies transferred from their mothers who may be immunized during the last trimester of pregnancy 
in october  we announced the results of our first phase i clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of our rsv vaccine candidate  and to evaluate total and neutralizing anti rsv antibody responses and the impact of an aluminum phosphate adjuvant 
along with positive safety results  the antibody response to the rsv f protein was significantly increased compared to placebo p in all dose groups and increased by fold in the highest dose adjuvant group at day a significant dose response pattern was observed with high rates of seroconversion at all doses including a rate of at the highest dose adjuvant group 
in october  we initiated two separate dose ranging clinical trials  one in women of child bearing age  which initiates our goal of developing a vaccine for maternal immunization of pregnant women  and the other in elderly adults  which initiates our goal of developing a vaccine for the elderly 
the first clinical trial is a randomized  blinded  placebo controlled phase ii clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of our rsv vaccine candidate with and without an aluminum phosphate adjuvant  enrolling women of childbearing age 
the second clinical trial is a randomized  blinded  placebo controlled phase i clinical trial that will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity results of enrolled adults  years of age and older  who received a single intramuscular injection of our rsv vaccine candidate with and without an aluminum phosphate adjuvant or placebo plus a single dose of licensed influenza vaccine or placebo at days and top line results from both clinical trials are expected to be reported in the first half of the design and timing of subsequent clinical trials will be determined after these data are analyzed 
our expected path forward in maternal immunization would include a dose confirmation clinical trial in women of child bearing age 
in parallel  and in consultation with the fda  we would expect to initiate a reproductive toxicology study to confirm the safety of our proposed formulation in advance of vaccinating pregnant women 
for the elderly  the path forward would likely be to design a phase ii clinical trial 
path clinical development agreement in july  we entered into a clinical development agreement with path to develop our vaccine candidate to protect against rsv through maternal immunization in low resource countries the rsv collaboration program 
we were awarded approximately million by path for initial funding under the agreement to partially support our phase ii dose ranging clinical trial in women of childbearing age as described above 
the agreement expires july   unless we and path decide to continue the rsv collaboration program 
we retain global rights to commercialize the product and have made a commitment to make the vaccine affordable and available in low resource countries 
to the extent path has continued to fund of our external clinical development costs for the rsv collaboration program  but we do not continue development  we would then grant path a fully paid license to our rsv vaccine technology for use in pregnant women in such low resource countries 
rabies rabies is a disease that causes acute encephalitis  or swelling of the brain  in warm blooded animals including humans 
the disease can be transmitted from one species of animal to another  such as from dogs to humans  most commonly by a bite from an infected animal 
for humans  rabies left untreated is almost invariably fatal 
who has estimated that the highest public health financial expenditure in any country is the cost of rabies post exposure prophylaxis 
in asia and africa  estimates show a combined  annual human deaths from endemic canine rabies  with annual treatment costs approaching million  although human deaths from rabies are likely to be grossly underreported in a number of countries  particularly in the youngest age groups 
in india alone   deaths are estimated to occur annually 
internal market data of vaccine manufacturers suggest that at the global level  million people receive rabies prophylaxis annually  the majority of whom live in china and india 
it is estimated that in the absence of post exposure prophylaxis  about  persons would die from rabies in africa and asia each year 
marketed rabies vaccine is mostly used for post exposure prophylaxis that requires generally between four and five administrations of vaccine 
pre exposure prophylaxis is recommended for anyone who will be at increased risk to the rabies virus  including travelers with extensive outdoor exposure in rural high risk areas 
the jv is currently developing a rabies vaccine candidate that we genetically engineered 
the jv expects to initiate phase i clinical trial in india in our objective is to develop a recombinant vaccine that can be administered as a pre exposure prophylaxis for residents of certain higher risk geographies  as well as travelers to such locations  and with the potential to provide post exposure prophylaxis with fewer doses 
preliminary pre clinical results have demonstrated that this vaccine candidate successfully prevents the rabies virus from entering the central nervous system  thus preventing death 
sales of common stock in  we completed two separate offerings to sell over million and million shares of common stock 
in october  we sold  shares of its common stock to ra capital management  llc ra capital  camber capital management llc and ayer capital management llc at a price of per share  resulting in approximately million in net proceeds 
in may  we sold  shares of our common stock to ra capital at a price of per share  resulting in approximately million in net proceeds 
in both cases  the shares were offered under an effective shelf registration statement previously filed with the sec 
the board of directors of the company the board has appointed a standing finance committee the committee to assist the board with its responsibilities to monitor  provide advice to senior management of the company and approve all capital raising activities 
the committee has been authorized by the board to approve all at market issuance sales transactions 
in doing so  the committee sets the amount of shares to be sold  the period of time during which such sales may occur and the minimum sales price per share 
in october  the company entered into an at market issuance sales agreement sales agreement  under which the company may sell an aggregate of million in gross proceeds of its common stock 
this agreement replaces the previous and terminated at market issuance sales agreement entered in march sales agreement  which also allowed for the sale of an aggregate of million in gross proceeds of its common stock  but had recently met its limitation of sales of shares 
the shares of common stock are being offered pursuant to a shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
during  the company sold million shares at an average sales price of per share  resulting in million in net proceeds  this amount excludes million received in early for million shares traded in late december the company sold a total  shares of its common stock and received gross proceeds of million under the sales agreement 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates  particularly estimates relating to accounting for revenue  the valuation of our investments  stock based compensation  long lived assets  goodwill and estimated recovery of our net deferred tax assets have a material impact on our financial statements and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of the results of operations discussed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
revenue we primarily derive revenue from a cost plus fixed fee contract in which hhs barda will reimburse us for allowable direct contract costs incurred plus allowable indirect costs and a fee earned in the further development of our seasonal and pandemic hn influenza vaccines 
revenue on this cost plus fixed fee contract is recognized as such costs are incurred plus a portion of the fixed fee earned 
billings under the contract are based on approved provisional indirect billing rates  which permit recovery of fringe benefits  overhead and general and administrative expenses not exceeding certain limits 
payments to the company under cost reimbursable contracts with agencies of the us government  including our contract with hhs barda  are provisional payments subject to adjustment upon annual audit by the government 
an audit by the government of fiscal year has been initiated  but has not been completed as of the date of this filing  however  management believes that revenue for periods subject to audit has been recorded in amounts that are expected to be realized upon final audit and settlement 
when the final determination of the allowable costs for any year has been made  revenue and billings may be adjusted accordingly 
investments our investments are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities  if determined to be other than temporary  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
investments are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in value is other than temporary 
management reviews criteria  such as the magnitude and duration of the decline  as well as the company s ability to hold the securities until market recovery  to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary 
if a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and the impairment is recorded in the statements of operations 
for investments carried at fair value  we disclose the level within the fair value hierarchy as prescribed by accounting standard codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures 
we evaluate the types of securities in our investment portfolio to determine the proper classification in the fair value hierarchy based on trading activity and market inputs 
we generally obtain information from an independent third party to help us determine the fair value of securities in level of the fair value hierarchy 
investment income is recorded when earned and included in interest income 
stock based compensation we account for our stock based compensation in accordance with asc  compensation stock compensation 
this standard requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant based on the award s fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as an expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for those awards expected to vest 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of certain assumptions  the most significant of which are our estimates of the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected term of the award 
our estimate of the expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the look back period corresponding to the expected term 
the expected term represents the period during which our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
we estimate this amount based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting requirements  and expectation of future employee behavior  including post vesting exercise and forfeiture history 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  our assumptions in future periods may change 
also  the accounting estimate of stock based compensation expense is reasonably likely to change from period to period as further stock options are granted and adjustments are made for stock option cancellations 
impairments of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets by performing a periodic evaluation of the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include  but are not limited to  the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses and or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
we consider historical performance and anticipated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets 
impairment losses are recognized when the sum of expected future cash flows is less than the assets carrying value 
goodwill our goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
we have determined since the company s only business is the development of recombinant vaccines that the company operates as a single operating segment and reporting unit 
we utilize the market approach and  if considered necessary  the income approach to determine if we have an impairment of our goodwill 
the market approach serves as the primary approach and is based on market value of invested capital 
the concluded fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value of our goodwill at december  and the income approach is used as a confirming look to the market approach 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  which we test annually at december given the current economic conditions and the uncertainties regarding their impact on us  there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future  or that any change in the assumptions or the current economic conditions will not trigger more frequently than on an annual basis 
if our assumptions are not achieved or economic conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
income tax receivables and liabilities  and deferred tax assets and liabilities  are recognized based on the amounts that more likely than not would be sustained upon ultimate settlement with taxing authorities 
developing our provision for income taxes and analyzing our tax position requires significant judgment and knowledge of federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on such evidence that can be objectively verified  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include cumulative losses in recent years  income losses expected in future years  the applicable statute of limitations  and potential limitations on available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in the period in which one of the following conditions is satisfied the more likely than not recognition threshold is satisfied  the position is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation  or the statute of limitations for the taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
tax benefits associated with an uncertain tax position are reversed in the period in which the more likely than not recognition threshold is no longer satisfied 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we concluded that the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  our net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance

risk factors of this annual report 
revenue change to change to revenue total revenue    revenue for was million as compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
revenue for and is primarily comprised of services performed under the hhs barda contract that was awarded in february and  to a much lesser extent in  the path clinical development agreement 
the increase in revenue is primarily due to the pandemic hn influenza clinical trials and product development activities that occurred during under the hhs barda contract see below regarding the trial 
revenue for was million as compared to million for  an increase of million 
revenue for is comprised of services performed under the hhs barda contract and revenue for resulted from work under other government contracts 
revenue for was negatively impacted due to the company electing to conduct the trial without immediate hhs barda reimbursement of its outside clinical trial costs  which are expected to total approximately million  of which million was incurred during see discussion of the trial in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview on page 
for  we expect a slight increase in revenue associated with our increased product development activities under the hhs barda contract to support the initiation of later stage clinical trials of our seasonal influenza and pandemic hn influenza vaccine candidates 
costs and expenses change to change to costs and expenses cost of government contracts revenue   research and development    general and administrative    total costs and expenses    cost of government contracts revenue cost of government contracts revenue includes direct costs of salaries  laboratory supplies  consultants and subcontractors and other direct costs associated with our process development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory and quality assurance activities under research contracts

cost of government contracts revenue increased to million for due to the development work performed under the hhs barda contract that was awarded in february cost of government contracts revenue for includes million of direct clinical trial costs of our trial 
for  we expect the cost of government contracts revenue to remain flat due to fewer clinical trials in as compared to  offset by increased product development activities under the hhs barda contract 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries  laboratory supplies  consultants and subcontractors and other expenses associated with our process development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory and quality assurance activities for internally funded programs 
in addition  indirect costs such as  fringe benefits and overhead expenses  are also included in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased costs relating to our rsv clinical trials an internally funded program at this time  higher employee related costs and expenses associated with our new manufacturing facility 
for  we expect a significant increase in research and development expenses primarily due to additional employee related costs to support product development of rsv and other potential vaccine candidates 
research and development expenses decreased to million for from million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to work performed under the hhs barda contract and as such  is being recorded as cost of government contracts revenue  and  to a lesser extent  lower outside testing costs including outsourced clinical trial costs  sponsored research and consulting agreements as a result of fewer clinical trials in costs and expenses by functional area we track our cost of government contracts revenue and research and development expenses by the type of costs incurred in identifying  developing  manufacturing and testing vaccine candidates 
we evaluate and prioritize our activities according to functional area and therefore believe that project by project information would not form a reasonable basis for disclosure to our investors 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development programs versus employees as of december  historically  we did not account for internal research and development expenses by project  since our employees work time is spread across multiple programs and our internal manufacturing clean room facility produces multiple vaccine candidates 
the following summarizes our cost of government contracts revenue and research and development expenses by functional area for the year ended december in millions 
manufacturing vaccine discovery clinical and regulatory total cost of government contracts revenue and research and development expenses we do not provide forward looking estimates of costs and time to complete our research programs due to the many uncertainties associated with vaccine development 
as we obtain data from pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials in order to focus our resources on more promising vaccine candidates 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time can vary substantially depending upon the phase  size of clinical trial  primary and secondary endpoints and the intended use of the vaccine candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the clinical trials  the number of sites included in the clinical trials  if clinical trial locations are domestic  international or both  the time to enroll patients  the duration of treatment and follow up  the safety and efficacy profile of the vaccine candidate  and the cost and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
as a result of these uncertainties  we are unable to determine with any significant degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or when  and to what extent  we will generate future cash flows from our research projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million for  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in expenses was primarily due to lower employee related costs  including severance expenses  and lower professional fees  partially offset by higher expenses associated with our new office facility 
for  we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million for  an increase of million  or

in  we utilized our investments to fund operations and increase our cash balances 
capital expenditures for and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the purchase of laboratory equipment and tenant improvements necessary to modify our new manufacturing facility 
for  we expect our level of capital expenditures to decrease due to the scale up work performed in on our new manufacturing facility 
the increase in our financing activities consists primarily of increased sales of our common stock 
we received net proceeds of million from the direct sale of our common stock and through our sales agreement  as compared to million in in november  we entered into lease agreements  under which we lease our new manufacturing  laboratory and office space in gaithersburg  maryland 
the lease agreements provide that  among other things  as of january   we sublease from the previous tenant  and subsequently lease directly from the landlord  approximately  total square feet  with rent payments for such space to the landlord commencing april  under the terms of the arrangement  the landlord provided us with a tenant improvement allowance of million and an additional tenant improvement allowance of million collectively  the improvement allowance

the wyeth license  which provides for an upfront payment previously made  ongoing annual license fees  milestone payments and royalties on any product sales  is a non exclusive  worldwide license to a family of patent applications covering vlp technology for use in human vaccines in certain fields  with expected patent expiration in early  the license may be terminated by wyeth only for cause and may be terminated by us only after we have provided ninety days notice that we have absolutely and finally ceased activity  including through any affiliate or sublicense  related to the manufacturing  development  marketing or sale of products covered by the license

in connection with our jv with cadila  we entered into a master services agreement  which we and cadila amended first in july  and subsequently in march  in each case to extend the term by one year for which services can be provided by cadila under this agreement 
under the revised terms  if  by march  the amount of services provided by cadila under the master services agreement is less than million  we will pay cadila the portion of the shortfall amount that is less than or equal to million and of the portion of the shortfall amount that exceeds million

based on our current cash and cash equivalents and investments  including our recent private equity offerings  anticipated revenue under the contract with hhs barda  possible proceeds from the sales of our common stock under our sales agreement and our current business operations  we believe we have adequate capital resources available to operate at planned levels for approximately the next months 
additional capital will be required in the future to develop our vaccine candidates through clinical development  manufacturing and commercialization 
our ability to obtain such additional capital is subject to various factors generating revenue under the hhs barda contract is subject to our performance under the contract  including our ability to collect on delayed reimbursement situations  such as the trial costs  and raising funds under our sales agreement is subject to both our business performance and market conditions 
further  we may seek additional capital through further public or private equity offerings  debt financing  additional strategic alliance and licensing arrangements  non dilutive government contracts  collaborative arrangements or some combination of these financing alternatives 
any capital raised by an equity offering will likely be substantially dilutive to the existing stockholders and any licensing or development arrangement may require us to give up rights to a product or technology at less than its full potential value 
other than our sales agreement  improvement allowance and equipment loan  we have not secured any additional commitments for new financing nor can we provide any assurance that new financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to perform under the hhs barda contract or obtain additional capital  we will assess our capital resources and will likely be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  and or downsize our organization  including our general and administrative infrastructure
