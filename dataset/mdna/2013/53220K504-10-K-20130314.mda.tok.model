item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses from continuing operations were million  million  and million in  and  respectively  of which   and  respectively  were sponsored by us 
there were no research and development expenses from discontinued operations in  and competition some of the drugs we and our collaborative partners are developing may compete with existing therapies or other drugs in development by other companies 
a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are pursuing intracellular receptor related approaches to drug discovery and development 
furthermore  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competing products or technologies and may establish collaborative arrangements with our competitors 
many of our existing or potential competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have greater financial  technical and human resources than we do and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
many of these companies also have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sales 
for a discussion of the risks associated with competition  see below under item a 
risk factors 
government regulation the manufacturing and marketing of our products  our ongoing research and development activities and products being developed by our collaborative partners are subject to regulation for safety and efficacy by numerous governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  pharmaceuticals are subject to rigorous regulation by federal and various state authorities  including the fda 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our products 
there are often comparable regulations that apply at the state level 
product development and approval within this regulatory framework takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 

table of contents the steps required before a pharmaceutical agent may be marketed in the united states include preclinical laboratory tests  the submission to the fda of an ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug  the submission of an nda to the fda and the fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda and  in california  with the food and drug branch of california 
domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to pre approval inspections by the fda prior to marketing approval  then to biennial inspections  and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp 
to supply products for use in the united states  foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with cgmp and are subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by regulatory authorities in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the fda 
for both currently marketed and future products  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements after obtaining regulatory approval can  among other things  result in the suspension of regulatory approval  as well as possible civil and criminal sanctions 
in addition  changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are also increasingly subject to regulation by the states 
a number of states now regulate  for example  pharmaceutical marketing practices and the reporting of marketing activities  controlled substances  clinical trials and general commercial practices 
we have developed and are developing a number of policies and procedures to ensure our compliance with these state laws  in addition to the federal regulations described above 
significant resources are now required on an ongoing basis to ensure such compliance 
for a discussion of the risks associated with government regulations  see below under item a 
risk factors 
patents and proprietary rights we believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business 
our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements to our inventions that are considered important to the development of our business 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
royalties we currently receive from pfizer on avinza represent a portion of our ongoing revenue 
the united states patent on avinza is not expected to expire until november  however  applications for generic forms of avinza have been submitted to the fda 
the last to expire united states patents relating to promacta is not expected to expire until august the last to expire united states patents related to captisol is not expected to expire until subject to compliance with the terms of the respective agreements  our rights to receive royalty payments under our licenses with our exclusive licensors extend for the life of the patents covering such developments 
for a discussion of the risks associated with patent and proprietary rights  see below under item a 
risk factors 
human resources as of february   we had full time employees  of whom are involved directly in scientific research and development activities 
of these employees  hold phd or phd degrees 
item a 
risk factors the following is a summary description of some of the many risks we face in our business 
you should carefully review these risks in evaluating our business  including the businesses of our subsidiaries 
you should also consider the other information described in this report 
revenues based on sales of promacta represent a substantial portion of our overall current and or expected future revenues 
gsk is obligated to pay us royalties on its sales of promacta 
these payments are expected to be a substantial portion of our ongoing revenues for some time 
as a result  any setback that may occur with respect to promacta could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
setbacks for promacta could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government regulation  safety issues  licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 

table of contents revenues based on sales of kyprolis represent a substantial portion of our overall expected future revenues 
revenue from onyx based on sales of kyprolis are expected to be a substantial portion of our revenue in the future and any setbacks that occur with respect to kyprolis could significantly impair our future operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
setbacks for kyprolis could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government regulation  safety issues  licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 
revenue from sales of captisol material to our collaborative partners represents a significant portion of our current revenue and our continued development and supply of captisol is subject to a number of risks 
in january  we completed our merger with cydex  in which we obtained exclusive rights to the captisol technology  in addition to other product candidates 
all of cydex products and product candidates  as well as the technology that it outlicenses  are based on captisol 
we must coordinate with our collaborative partners concerning the development  manufacturing  regulatory and intellectual property protection strategies for captisol and new development product candidates 
in addition  we rely on our collaborative partners for many aspects of our captisol developmental and commercialization activities  and we are subject to risks related to their financial stability and solvency 
in addition  ligand or its partners are attempting to develop product candidates that may contain significantly higher levels of captisol than in any currently approved product and has directed developers to demonstrate an adequate safety margin and specifically acceptable renal safety 
if products or product candidates incorporating captisol technology were to cause any unexpected adverse events  whether in preclinical studies  clinical trials or as commercialized products  whether as a result of captisol or otherwise  the perception of captisol safety could be seriously harmed 
if this were to occur  we may not be able to market captisol products unless and until we are able to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  which we may not be able to do 
further  whether or not the adverse event was a result of captisol  we could be required by the fda to submit to additional regulatory reviews or approvals  including extensive safety testing or clinical testing of products using captisol  which would be expensive and  even if we were to demonstrate that the adverse event was unrelated to captisol  would delay our marketing of captisol enabled products and receipt of revenue related to those products  which could significantly impair our operating results and or reduce the market price of our stock 
our product candidates face significant development and regulatory hurdles prior to marketing which could delay or prevent sales and or milestone revenue 
before we or our partners obtain the approvals necessary to sell any of our potential products  we must show through preclinical studies and human testing that each product is safe and effective 
we and our partners have a number of products moving toward or currently awaiting regulatory action 
failure to show any product s safety and effectiveness could delay or prevent regulatory approval of a product and could adversely affect our business 
the clinical trials process is complex and uncertain 
for example  the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials may not necessarily predict the results from later large scale clinical trials 
in addition  clinical trials may not demonstrate a product s safety and effectiveness to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
recently  a number of companies have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials or in seeking regulatory approvals  despite promising results in earlier trials 
the fda may also require additional clinical trials after regulatory approvals are received 
such additional trials may be expensive and time consuming  and failure to successfully conduct those trials could jeopardize continued commercialization of a product 
the rates at which we complete our clinical trials depends on many factors  including  but are not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate supplies of the products to be tested and patient enrollment 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the trial and other potential drug candidates being studied 
delays in patient enrollment for our trials may result in increased costs and longer development times 
in addition  our collaborative partners have rights to control product development and clinical programs for products developed under the collaborations 
as a result  these collaborative partners may conduct these programs more slowly or in a different manner than expected 
moreover  even if clinical trials are completed  we or our collaborative partners still may not apply for fda approval in a timely manner or the fda still may not grant approval 

table of contents we rely heavily on collaborative relationships  and any disputes or litigation with our collaborative partners or termination or breach of any of the related agreements could reduce the financial resources available to us  including research and development funding  milestone payments and future royalty revenues 
our strategy for developing and commercializing many of our potential products  including products aimed at larger markets  includes entering into collaborations with corporate partners and others 
these collaborations have provided us with funding and research and development resources for potential products for the treatment of a variety of diseases 
however  the funding provided to us by our existing collaborative partners for ongoing research and development under our existing collaborative agreements has ceased 
these agreements also give our collaborative partners significant discretion when deciding whether or not to pursue any development program 
our existing collaborations may not continue or be successful  and we may be unable to enter into future collaborative arrangements to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
in addition  our collaborators may develop drugs  either alone or with others that compete with the types of drugs they are developing with us 
this would result in increased competition for our programs 
if products are approved for marketing under our collaborative programs  revenues we receive will depend on the manufacturing  marketing and sales efforts of our collaborative partners  who generally retain commercialization rights under the collaborative agreements 
generally  our current collaborative partners also have the right to terminate their collaborations under specified circumstances 
if any of our collaborative partners breach or terminate their agreements with us or otherwise fail to conduct their collaborative activities successfully for example  by not making required payments when due  or at all  our product development under these agreements will be delayed or terminated 
disputes or litigation may also arise with our collaborators  including disputes or litigation over ownership rights to intellectual property  know how or technologies developed with our collaborators 
such disputes or litigation could adversely affect our rights to one or more of our product candidates 
any such dispute or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the collaborative research  development and commercialization of certain potential products  create uncertainty as to ownership rights of intellectual property  or could result in litigation or arbitration 
the occurrence of any of these problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 
we obtain captisol from a sole source supplier  and if this supplier were to cease to be able to supply captisol to us  or decline to supply captisol to us  we would be unable to continue to derive revenue or continue to develop our product candidates until we obtained an alternative source  which could take a considerable length of time 
we currently have one supplier of captisol  hovione farmaciencia sa  or hovione  through its agent hovione llc 
hovione is a major supplier of apis and api intermediates located in portugal 
hovione has other production sites in cork  ireland  macau  china  and zhejiang  china  but those sites are not yet fully qualified to make captisol 
if a major disaster were to happen at hovione or hovione were to suffer major production problems or were to fail to deliver captisol to us for any other reason  there could be a significant interruption of our captisol supply 
while we carry a significant inventory of captisol for this type of occurrence  which should permit us to satisfy our existing supply obligations through under current and anticipated demand conditions  a series of unusually large orders could rapidly deplete that inventory and cause significant problems with our licensees and disrupt our business 
in addition  if we fail to supply captisol under our supply agreements  our customers could obtain the right to have captisol manufactured by other suppliers  which would significantly harm our business 
we rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of captisol and product candidates  and if these contract manufacturers fail to perform as we expect  we will incur delays in our ability to generate revenue and substantial additional expenses in obtaining new contract manufacturers 
we do not manufacture products or product candidates  but rather contract with contract manufacturers for the manufacture of products and product candidates 
with respect to any specific product or product candidate  we only contract with one contract manufacturer due to the high cost of compliance with good manufacturing practices prior to the contract manufacturer being permitted to manufacture the product or product candidate for use in humans 
if a contract manufacturer is unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture for us in the future  we would be required to contract with a new contract manufacturer for the specific product or product candidate 
in the case of products  this would cause us to lose revenue during the qualification process  and in the case of product candidates  this could cause a delay in the commercialization of the product candidate 
in addition  in either case we would incur substantial additional expenses as a result of the new contract manufacturer becoming qualified 
further  if a contract manufacturer were to experience a delay in producing products or product candidates due to a failure to meet strict fda manufacturing requirements or otherwise  we would also experience a delay in development and commercialization of the product candidate or  in the case of products  sales of the product 
this risk is exacerbated in the case of manufacture of injectables  which require heightened sterility and other conditions as well as specialized facilities for preparation 

table of contents expirations of  challenges to or failure to secure patents and other proprietary rights may significantly hurt our business 
the initially filed patents relating to captisol expired in  and in the us and will expire between and in most countries outside the us we have also obtained patent protection in the us through on one or more agglomerated forms of captisol and through on one or more high purity forms of captisol 
we have obtained patent protection on a number of combinations of apis and captisol through three combination patents in the us  and we have applied for six additional combination patents in the us relating to the combination of captisol with specific apis 
our us combination patent relating to fosphenytoin expires june  and our us combination patent relating to amiodarone expires may  our us combination patent relating to one of our early stage product candidates expires march  there is no guarantee that these patents will be sufficient to prevent competitors from creating a generic form of captisol after and competing against us  or from developing combination patents for products that will prevent us from developing products using those apis 
in addition  most of the agreements in our captisol outlicensing business  provide that once the relevant patent expires  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or eliminated 
generally  our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patents and proprietary rights for our potential products both in the united states and in foreign countries 
patents may not be issued from any of these applications currently on file  or  if issued  may not provide sufficient protection 
our patent position  like that of many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  is uncertain and involves complex legal and technical questions for which important legal principles are unresolved 
we may not develop or obtain rights to products or processes that are patentable 
even if we do obtain patents  such patents may not adequately protect the technology we own or have licensed 
in addition  others may challenge  seek to invalidate  infringe or circumvent any patents we own or license and rights we receive under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
for example  our european patent related to agglomerated forms of captisol is currently being opposed and observations have been filed against our european patent application related to high purity captisol 
any conflicts resulting from the patent rights of others could significantly reduce the coverage of our patents and limit our ability to obtain meaningful patent protection 
we have had and will continue to have discussions with our current and potential collaborative partners regarding the scope and validity of our patents and other proprietary rights 
if a collaborative partner or other party successfully establishes that our patent rights are invalid  we may not be able to continue our existing collaborations beyond their expiration 
any determination that our patent rights are invalid also could encourage our collaborative partners to seek early termination of our agreements 
such invalidation could adversely affect our ability to enter into new collaborations 
we may also need to initiate litigation  which could be time consuming and expensive  to enforce our proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of others rights 
if litigation occurs  a court may find our patents or those of our licensors invalid or may find that we have infringed on a competitor s rights 
in addition  if any of our competitors have filed patent applications in the united states which claim technology we also have invented  the united states patent and trademark office may require us to participate in expensive interference proceedings to determine who has the right to a patent for the technology 
we also rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to protect and maintain our competitive position 
we require our employees  consultants  collaborative partners and others to sign confidentiality agreements when they begin their relationship with us 
these agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our competitors may independently discover our trade secrets 
our collaborative partners may change their strategy or the focus of their development and commercialization efforts with respect to our alliance products  the success of our alliance products could be adversely affected 
if our collaborative partners terminate their collaborations with us or do not commit sufficient resources to the development  manufacture  marketing or distribution of our alliance products  we could be required to devote additional resources to our alliance products  seek new collaborative partners or abandon such alliance products  all of which could have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents we are currently dependent upon out licensing our technologies and we may not be successful in entering into additional out license agreements on favorable terms  which may adversely affect our liquidity or require us to alter development plans on our products 
we have entered into several out licensing agreements for the development and commercialization of our products 
we currently depend on our arrangements with our outlicensees to sell products using our captisol technology 
these agreements generally provide that outlicensees may terminate the agreements at will 
if our outlicensees discontinue sales of products using our captisol technology  fail to obtain regulatory approval for their products using our captisol technology  fail to satisfy their obligations under their agreements with us  or otherwise choose to utilize a generic form of captisol should it become available  or if we are unable to establish new licensing and marketing relationships  our financial results and growth prospects would be materially affected 
further  under most of our captisol outlicenses  the amount of royalties we receive will be reduced or will cease when the relevant patent expires 
while we have other more recent patents relating to captisol with later expiration dates for example  our high purity patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until and our morphology patent  us patent no 
 is not expected to expire until  the initially filed patents relating to captisol expired in and in the us and will expire between and in most countries outside the us if our other intellectual property rights are not sufficient to prevent a generic form of captisol from coming to market and if in such case our outlicensees choose to terminate their agreements with us  the source of the vast majority of our captisol revenue may cease to exist 
although we expend considerable resources on internal research and development for our proprietary programs  we may not be successful in entering into additional out licensing agreements under favorable terms due to several factors including the difficulty in creating valuable product candidates that target large market opportunities  research and spending priorities of potential licensing partners  willingness of and the resources available to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to in license product candidates for their clinical pipelines  or differences of opinion with potential partners on the valuation of products we are seeking to out license 
the inability to enter into out licensing agreements under favorable terms and to earn milestone payments  license fees and or upfront fees may adversely affect our liquidity and may force us to curtail or delay development of some or all of our proprietary programs  which in turn may harm our business and the value of our stock 
third party intellectual property may prevent us or our partners from developing our potential products and we may owe a portion of any payments we receive from our collaborative partners to one or more third parties 
our success will depend on our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others  both in the united states and in foreign countries 
in addition  disputes with licensors under our license agreements may arise which could result in additional financial liability or loss of important technology and potential products and related revenue  if any 
further  the manufacture  use or sale of our potential products or our collaborative partners products or potential products may infringe the patent rights of others 
this could impact captisol  promacta  kyprolis  avinza  viviant and conbriza bazedoxifene  fablyn  and other products or potential products 
several drug companies and research and academic institutions have developed technologies  filed patent applications or received patents for technologies that may be related to our business 
others have filed patent applications and received patents that conflict with patents or patent applications we have licensed for our use  either by claiming the same methods or compounds or by claiming methods or compounds that could dominate those licensed to us 
in addition  we may not be aware of all patents or patent applications that may impact our ability to make  use or sell any of our potential products 
for example  us patent applications may be kept confidential while pending in the united states patent and trademark office and patent applications filed in foreign countries are often first published six months or more after filing 
disagreements or litigation with our collaborative partners could delay our ability and the ability of our collaborative partners to achieve milestones or our receipt of other payments 
in addition  other possible disagreements or litigation could delay  interrupt or terminate the research  development and commercialization of certain potential products being developed by either our collaborative partners or by us 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing problems could be time consuming and expensive and could adversely affect our business 

table of contents third parties have not directly threatened an action or claim against us  although we do periodically receive other communications or have other conversations with the owners of other patents or other intellectual property 
if others obtain patents with conflicting claims  we may be required to obtain licenses to those patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we may not be able to obtain any such licenses on acceptable terms  or at all 
any failure to obtain such licenses could delay or prevent us from pursuing the development or commercialization of our potential products 
in general  litigation claims can be expensive and time consuming to bring or defend against and could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
if our business does not perform according to our expectations  we may not be able to pay off our existing debt 
our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception 
as of december   we had negative working capital of million 
clinical and preclinical development of drug candidates is a long  expensive and uncertain process 
also  we may acquire companies  businesses or products and the consummation of such acquisitions may consume additional cash 
for example  in connection with our acquisition of cydex  we entered into a million loan and security agreement  or the loan agreement  with a lender 
the loan was amended in january to increase the secured credit facility to million 
the original million borrowed under the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the additional million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the secured debt  we will make interest only payments through march subsequent to the interest only payments  the note will amortize with principal and interest payments through the remaining term of the loan 
additionally  we must also make an additional final payment equal to of the total amount borrowed which is due at maturity and is being accreted over the life of the loan 
the maturity date of the term loan is august  we also have a cash collateralized revolving credit facility under which we may elect to borrow up to million 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to basis points above the prime rate 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility may become due and payable if we fail to maintain a cash balance equal to the amount outstanding under the credit facility 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is march  in october  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale of up to million of equity or other securities  proceeds from which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the form s provides additional financial flexibility for us to sell shares or other securities as needed at any time 
as of december    common shares have been issued under this registration statement for total net proceeds of approximately million 
we believe that our capital resources  including our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty revenues  will be adequate to fund our operations at their current levels at least for the next months 
however  changes may occur that would cause us to consume available capital resources before that time and we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings to fund our operations 
our inability to obtain additional financing could adversely affect our business 
financings may not be available at all or on terms favorable to us 
in addition  these financings  if completed  may not meet our capital needs and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or drug development programs 
we may also be required to liquidate our business or file for bankruptcy protection 
alternatively  we may be forced to attempt to continue development by entering into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that require us to relinquish some or all of our rights to technologies or drug candidates that we would not otherwise relinquish 
our product development involves a number of uncertainties  and we may never generate sufficient collaborative payments and royalties from the development of products to become profitable 
we were founded in we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 

table of contents most of our products in development will require extensive additional development  including preclinical testing and human studies  as well as regulatory approvals  before they can be marketed 
we cannot predict if or when any of the products we are developing or those being developed with our partners will be approved for marketing 
there are many reasons why we or our collaborative partners may fail in our efforts to develop our potential products  including the possibility that preclinical testing or human studies may show that our potential products are ineffective or cause harmful side effects  the products may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals from the fda or foreign authorities in a timely manner  or at all  the products  if approved  may not be produced in commercial quantities or at reasonable costs  the products  if approved  may not achieve commercial acceptance  regulatory or governmental authorities may apply restrictions to our products  which could adversely affect their commercial success  or the proprietary rights of other parties may prevent us or our partners from marketing the products 
any product development failures for these or other reasons  whether with our products or our partners products  may reduce our expected revenues  profits  and stock price 
any future material weaknesses or deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting could harm stockholder and business confidence on our financial reporting  our ability to obtain financing and other aspects of our business 
as described in item a  we identified material weaknesses as a result of improper accounting for non routine transactions and the controls over the determination of fair value of contingent liabilities 
our audit committee  after consultation with management has determined that the material weaknesses were a result of inadequate staffing and review processes 
as a result of the material weaknesses associated with non routine transactions  we have added a corporate controller to our finance and accounting staff 
while we had processes to identify and apply accounting standards to complex transactions  we enhanced these processes with the addition of a resource with the ability to research and understand the nuances of complex accounting standards 
additionally  we plan to enhance our controls over the determination of the fair value of contingent liabilities by including a formal review of mathematical calculations and completeness of such calculations 
given the material weaknesses  our audit committee  after consultation with management determined that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting 
the existence of one or more material weaknesses or significant deficiencies could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements 
substantial costs and resources may be required to rectify any internal control deficiencies 
if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls in accordance with applicable standards  we may be unable to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports  our business and financial condition could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  or the market price of our stock could decline significantly 
in addition  our ability to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business  or obtain additional financing on favorable terms  could be materially and adversely affected  which  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  our financial condition and the market value of our securities 
moreover  our reputation with customers  lenders  investors  securities analysts and others may be adversely affected 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions in the future and any difficulties from integrating such acquisitions could adversely affect our stock price  operating results and results of operations 
we may acquire companies  businesses and products that complement or augment our existing business 
we may not be able to integrate any acquired business successfully or operate any acquired business profitably 
integrating any newly acquired business could be expensive and time consuming 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and could prove to be more difficult or expensive than we predict 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with any future acquisitions we may consummate could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards and controls that could negatively affect our ability to maintain third party relationships 
moreover  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  or issue additional shares  to acquire any businesses or products  which may result in dilution for stockholders or the incurrence of indebtedness 
as part of our efforts to acquire companies  business or product candidates or to enter into other significant transactions  we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in the transaction 
despite our efforts  we ultimately may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks and  as a result  might not realize the intended advantages of the transaction 
if we fail to realize the expected benefits from acquisitions we may consummate in the future  whether as a result of unidentified risks  integration difficulties  regulatory setbacks and other events  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if we acquire product candidates  we will also need to make certain assumptions about  among other things  development costs  the likelihood of receiving regulatory approval and the market for such product candidates 
our assumptions may prove to be incorrect  which could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these transactions 

table of contents in addition  we will likely experience significant charges to earnings in connection with our efforts  if any  to consummate acquisitions 
for transactions that are ultimately not consummated  these charges may include fees and expenses for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants and other advisors in connection with our efforts 
even if our efforts are successful  we may incur  as part of a transaction  substantial charges for closure costs associated with elimination of duplicate operations and facilities and acquired ipr d charges 
in either case  the incurrence of these charges could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
revenues based on sales of avinza could decrease or be eliminated 
pfizer  as successor to king  is obligated to pay us royalties based on the sales of avinza 
any setback that may occur with respect to avinza could reduce our revenue 
setbacks for avinza could include problems with shipping  distribution  manufacturing  product safety  marketing  government regulation  licenses and approvals  intellectual property rights  competition with existing or new products and physician or patient acceptance of the products  as well as higher than expected total rebates  returns or discounts 
avinza could also face regulatory action and product safety issues and is also subject to generic competition 
if plaintiffs bring product liability lawsuits against us or our partners  we or our partners may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our approved products and product candidates  and we may be subject to other liabilities related to the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
we and our partners face an inherent risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and face an even greater risk for commercialized products 
although we are not currently a party to product liability litigation  if we are sued  we may be held liable if any product or product candidate we develop causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing  manufacturing  marketing or sale 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for any product candidates or products that we may develop  injury to our reputation  discontinuation of clinical trials  costs to defend litigation  substantial monetary awards to clinical trial participants or patients  loss of revenue and the inability to commercialize any products that we develop 
we have product liability insurance that covers our clinical trials up to a million annual limit 
we intend to expand product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any products that we may develop 
however  this insurance may be prohibitively expensive  or may not fully cover our potential liabilities 
inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or delay the commercialization of our product candidates 
if we are sued for any injury caused by our product candidates or any future products  our liability could exceed our total assets 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify eisai and king under certain circumstances pursuant to the asset purchase agreements we entered into with eisai and king in connection with the sale of our prior commercial product lines 
some of our indemnification obligations still remain and our potential liability in certain circumstances is not limited to specific dollar amounts 
we cannot predict the liabilities that may arise as a result of these matters 
any claims related to our indemnification obligations to king or eisai could materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
in addition  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which was million as of december  
we remain liable to organon in the event king defaults on this obligation 
any requirement to pay a material amount to organon  could adversely affect our business and the price of our securities 
the sale of our prior commercial product lines does not relieve us of exposure to product liability risks on products we sold prior to divesting these product lines 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us may not be insured and could result in payment of significant amounts of money and divert management s attention from running our business 
if our partners do not reach the market with our alliance products before our competitors offer products for the same or similar uses  or if our partners are not effective in marketing our alliance products  our revenues from product sales  if any  will be reduced 
we face intense competition in our development activities 
our competitors might succeed in obtaining regulatory approval for competitive products more rapidly than our partners can for our products 
in addition  competitors might develop technologies and products that are less expensive and perceived to be safer or more effective than those being developed by us or our partners  which could impair our product development and render our technology obsolete 

table of contents we may not be able to hire and or retain key employees 
if we are unable to hire and or retain key employees  we may not have sufficient resources to successfully manage our assets or our business  and we may not be able to perform our obligations under various contracts and commitments 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of our key management and scientific personnel 
if we fail to retain such key employees  we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our mergers 
either of these could have substantial negative impacts on our business and our stock price 
we use hazardous materials  which may expose us to significant liability 
in connection with our research and development activities  we handle hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
to properly dispose of these hazardous materials in compliance with environmental regulations  we are required to contract with third parties 
we believe that we carry reasonably adequate insurance for toxic tort claims 
however  we cannot eliminate the risk or predict the exposure of accidental contamination or injury from the handling and disposing of hazardous materials  whether by us or our third party contractors 
any accident in the handling and disposing of hazardous materials may expose us to significant liability 
our shareholder rights plan and charter documents may hinder or prevent change of control transactions 
our shareholder rights plan and provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in our ownership 
in addition  our board of directors may issue shares of preferred stock without any further action by the stockholders 
such restrictions and issuances may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our ownership 
if changes in our ownership are discouraged  delayed or prevented  it would be more difficult for our current board of directors to be removed and replaced  even if you or our other stockholders believe that such actions are in the best interests of us and our stockholders 
we may lose some or all of the value of some of our short term investments 
the investments are intended to maintain safety of principal while providing liquidity adequate to meet projected cash requirements 
risks of principal loss are to be minimized through diversified short and medium term investments of high quality  but the investments are not in every case guaranteed or fully insured 
from time to time we may suffer other losses on our short term investment portfolio 
funding of our drug development programs will make those funds unavailable for other uses 
our drug development programs may require substantial additional capital to successfully complete them  arising from costs to conduct research  preclinical testing and human studies  establish pilot scale and commercial scale manufacturing processes and facilities  and establish and develop quality control  regulatory  marketing  sales and administrative capabilities to support these programs 
while we expect to fund our research and development activities from cash generated from royalties and milestones from our partners in various past and future collaborations to the extent possible  if we are unable to do so  we may need to complete additional equity or debt financings or seek other external means of financing 
these financings could depress our stock price 
if additional funds are required to support our operations and we are unable to obtain them on terms favorable to us  we may be required to cease or reduce further development or commercialization of our products  to sell some or all of our technology or assets or to merge with another entity 
our results of operations and liquidity needs could be materially negatively affected by market fluctuations and economic downturn 
our results of operations could be materially negatively affected by economic conditions generally  both in the us and elsewhere around the world 
continuing concerns over inflation  energy costs  geopolitical issues  the availability and cost of credit  and the us financial markets have contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and the markets going forward 
these factors  combined with volatile oil prices  declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment  have precipitated an economic recession and fears of a possible depression 
domestic and international equity markets continue to experience heightened volatility and turmoil 
these events and the continuing market upheavals may have an adverse effect on us 
in the event of a continuing market downturn  our results of operations could be adversely affected by those factors in many ways  including making it more difficult for us to raise funds if necessary  and our stock price may further decline

to the extent the value of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets or other long lived assets become impaired  we will be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment 
any impairment charges could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and the market value of our common stock 
the occurrence of a catastrophic disaster could damage our facilities beyond insurance limits or we could lose key data which could cause us to curtail or cease operations 
we are vulnerable to damage and or loss of vital data from natural disasters  such as earthquakes  tornadoes  power loss  fire  floods and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business could be seriously impaired 
we have property  liability  and business interruption insurance which may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other similar significant business interruptions  and we do not plan to purchase additional insurance to cover such losses due to the cost of obtaining such coverage

table of contents we are a biotechnology company that operates with a business model focused on developing or acquiring revenue generating assets and coupling them to a lean corporate cost structure 
our goal is to create a sustainably profitable business and generate meaningful value for our stockholders 
since a portion of our business model is based on the goal of partnering with other pharmaceutical companies to commercialize and market our assets  a significant amount of our revenue is based largely on payments made to us by partners for royalties  milestones and license fees 
we recognized the important role of the drug reformulation segment in the pharmaceutical industry and in added captisol to our technology portfolio 
captisol is a powerful formulation technology that has enabled six fda approved products  including onyx s kyprolis and baxter international s nexterone and is currently being developed in a number of clinical stage partner programs 
in comparison to our peers  we believe we have assembled one of the largest and most diversified asset portfolios in the industry with the potential to generate significant revenue in the future 
the therapies in our development portfolio address the unmet medical needs of patients for a broad spectrum of diseases including hepatitis  muscle wasting  multiple myeloma  alzheimer s disease  dyslipidemia  diabetes  anemia  epilepsy  fsgs and osteoporosis 
we have established multiple alliances with the world s leading pharmaceutical companies including glaxosmithkline  onyx pharmaceuticals  merck  pfizer  baxter international  bristol myers squibb  celgene  lundbeck inc  eli lilly and co  spectrum pharmaceuticals and the medicines company 
in early  we licensed the world wide rights to re formerly known as dara a dual acting receptor antagonist of angiotension and endothelin receptors to retrophin  inc  or retrophin 
retrophin intends to develop re for orphan indications of severe kidney diseases including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis fsgs as well as conduct proof of concept studies in resistant hypertension and diabetic nephropathy 
certain patient groups with severely compromised renal function exhibit extreme proteinuria resulting in progression to dialysis and a high mortality rate 
re  with its unique dual blockade of angiotensin and endothelin receptors  is expected to provide meaningful clinical benefits in mitigating proteinuria in indications where there are no approved therapies 
we received an upfront payment of million  net of amounts owed to third parties 
in december  we received a milestone payment of  shares of common stock in partner retrophin  inc the milestone arose under the previously executed license agreement for the development and commercialization of retrophin lead clinical candidate re and was triggered by the completion of retrophin merger with desert gateway  inc and its transition to a publicly traded company 
we recorded milestone revenue equal to the estimated fair value of the shares received  net of amounts owed to a third party  which was determined by an independent valuation firm 
the shares issued to us represent approximately of retrophin outstanding capital stock and are subject to a one year trading restriction 
in early we received a million milestone payment from retrophin  inc 
ligand will remit million to former license holders under the terms of a previous license agreement for re in july  our licensee  onyx pharmaceuticals  inc onyx  received accelerated approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for kyprolis carfilzomib for injection 
we received a milestone of million upon approval by the fda 
kyprolis is formulated with ligand s captisol and is used for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least two prior therapies  including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent  and have demonstrated disease progression on or within days of completion of the last therapy 
under our agreement with onyx  we are entitled to receive milestones  tiered royalties ranging between and 
in september  the company filed a demand for arbitration against chiva pharmaceuticals  inc chiva with the american arbitration association 
the demand asserted claims for damages resulting from chiva breach of the october  fablyn license agreement fablyn license agreement for failure to tender a milestone payment and failure to pay certain patent prosecution expenses 
in october  the company reached a settlement with chiva  whereby the parties resolved all disputes that had arisen between them  including ligand primary claim in arbitration relating to payments due under the fablyn license agreement 
as part of the settlement  the parties executed mutual releases and ligand agreed to seek dismissal of all claims asserted in the arbitration 
in return  chiva agreed to pay ligand million  which has been received by the company 
in october  our licensee  merck  initiated a phase iib iii adaptive clinical trial for dinaciclib for the treatment of patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll 
as a result  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a million milestone payment upon initiation of the clinical study 
under our collaboration and license agreement with merck  we are entitled to receive future milestones and royalties 

table of contents in november  the fda approved promacta for the treatment of thrombocytopenia low blood platelet counts in patients with chronic hepatitis c to allow them to initiate and maintain interferon based therapy 
promacta is the first supportive care treatment available to patients who are ineligible or poor candidates for interferon based therapy due to their low blood platelet counts 
promacta in combination with interferon based therapy has been shown to improve a patient chance of achieving a sustained virologic response svr or viral cure 
as a result of the regulatory approvals of promacta  pursuant to the terms of a license agreement with gsk  we are entitled to receive tiered royalties on annual net sales of promacta 
gsk has listed a patent in the fda s orange book for promacta with an expiration date in in march  we entered into a license agreement with spectrum pharmaceuticals  inc spectrum 
under the license agreement  we granted to spectrum an exclusive  nontransferable  worldwide license to such intellectual property rights that will enable spectrum to develop and potentially commercialize captisol enabled propylene glycol free melphalan 
contemporaneously with the entry into the license agreement  we entered into a supply agreement to provide captisol to spectrum 
under the supply agreement  spectrum agreed to purchase its captisol requirements for the development of the compound contemplated by the license agreement  as well as any captisol required for any product that is successfully commercialized 
we are entitled to receive a non refundable license issuance fee of million 
additionally  we are entitled to milestone payments and royalties on future net sales of the captisol enabled melphalan product 
this program is currently enrolling patients in a pivotal clinical trial 
metabasis contingent value rights in january  we completed our acquisition of metabasis 
in addition to cash consideration  we issued four tradable contingent value rights cvrs  one cvr from each of four respective series of cvrs  for each metabasis share 
the cvrs will entitle the holder to cash payments as frequently as every six months as cash is received by us from the sale or partnering of any of the metabasis drug development programs  among other triggering events 
we have also committed to spend at least million within months and million within months  in new research and development funding on the metabasis programs 
through december   we estimate that we have spent approximately million of the committed amount 
in january  we granted licenses to chiva to begin immediate development in china of two clinical stage hepdirect programs  pradefovir for hepatitis b and mb for hepatocellular carcinoma 
additionally  we granted chiva a non exclusive hepdirect technology license for the discovery  development and worldwide commercialization of new compounds in hepatitis b hepb  hepatitis c hepc and hepatocellular carcinoma hcc 
under the terms of the agreement  we are entitled to milestones and royalties on potential sales 
in addition  we are entitled to receive a portion of any sublicensing revenue generated from sublicensing of collaboration compounds to third parties in a major world market 
we received a million license payment in march  of which million was remitted to cvr holders 
in august  we entered into an amendment to the license agreement which required that a second million licensing fee be paid in september in addition  the amendment increased royalty rates which we may receive under the license agreement to of net sales of products other than pradefovir and of net sales for pradefovir 
in addition  the amendment removed from the license agreement a provision that afforded us the potential to earn a equity position in chiva as a milestone payment 
in september  chiva paid us the million licensing fee called for by the amendment  of which million was remitted to cvr holders 
in september  we entered into an option agreement with an undisclosed partner  which required our partner to pay a  upfront option opening fee  of which is required to be remitted to the metabasis cvr holders pursuant to the cvr agreement 
in october  we remitted  to the metabasis cvr holders  equivalent to the option fee less costs and expenses incurred in connection with the option agreement 
results of operations total revenues for were million compared to million in and million in our loss from continuing operations for was million or per share  compared to income from continuing operations of million in  or per share  and loss from continuing operations of million  or per share in 
table of contents royalty revenue royalty revenues were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in royalty revenue of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively is primarily due to an increase in promacta sales 
material sales we recorded material sales of million in compared to million in no material sales were recorded in the decrease in material sales for the year ended december  compared to is due to timing of customer purchases of captisol 
collaborative research and development and other revenue we recorded collaborative research and development and other revenues of million in compared to million in and million in the decrease of million for the year ended december   compared to the same period in is due to the recognition of million of deferred revenue related to the previous sale of royalty rights for the year ended december   partially offset by an increase in license fees and milestones of million for the year ended december  the decrease in collaborative research and development and other revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to is primarily due to the termination of the research funded stage of a majority of the company then existing collaboration agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for were million compared to million in and million in the increase in research and development expenses of million for the year ended december  is primarily due to an increase in costs associated with internal programs 
the decrease of million for the year ended december   compared with was primarily due to million of costs associated with collaboration agreements that were terminated as well as million of other costs associated with internal research programs 
as summarized in the table below  we are developing several proprietary products for a variety of indications 
our programs are not limited to the following  but are representative of a range of future licensing opportunities to expand our partnered asset portfolio 
program disease indication development phase selective androgen receptor modulator various phase ii ready captisol enabled topiramate epilepsy phasei ii glucagon receptor antagonist diabetes pre ind hepdirect liver diseases preclinical oral human granulocyte colony stimulating factor neutropenia preclinical oral erythropoietin anemia preclinical we do not provide forward looking estimates of costs and time to complete our ongoing research and development projects as such estimates would involve a high degree of uncertainty 
uncertainties include our inability to predict the outcome of complex research  our inability to predict the results of clinical studies  regulatory requirements placed upon us by regulatory authorities such as the fda and ema  our inability to predict the decisions of our collaborative partners  our ability to fund research and development programs  competition from other entities of which we may become aware in future periods  predictions of market potential from products that may be derived from our research and development efforts  and our ability to recruit and retain personnel or third party research organizations with the necessary knowledge and skills to perform certain research 
refer to item a 
risk factors for additional discussion of the uncertainties surrounding our research and development initiatives 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for and million for the increase in general and administrative expenses of million is primarily due to an increase in tax consulting projects and legal expenses in the increase in expenses for the year ended december  compared with is primarily due to costs to operate the cydex business and an increase in non cash stock based compensation expenses 
lease exit and termination costs in september  we ceased use of our facility located in cranbury  new jersey 
as a result  during the quarter ended september   we recorded lease exit costs of million for costs related to the difference between the remaining lease obligations of the abandoned operating leases  which run through august  and management s estimate of potential future sublease income  discounted to present value 
actual future sublease income may differ materially from our estimate  which would result in us recording additional expense or reductions in expense 
in addition  we wrote off approximately million of property and equipment related to the facility closure and recorded approximately million of severance related costs 
we recorded an increase of million in lease exit and termination costs for the year ended december  due to changes in leasing assumptions 
we recorded  as a decrease in lease exit and termination costs for the year ended december  write off of in process research and development in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write off of intellectual property and interests in future milestones and royalties for medi  an il antibody program by astrazeneca s subsidiary  medimmune 
the asset was impaired upon receipt of notice from medimmune that it was exercising its right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement 
additionally  in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for the write off of interests in future milestones for trpv  a collaborative research and licensing program between us and merck  related to the physiology  pharmacology  chemistry and potential therapeutic applications and potential clinical utilities related to vanilloid receptors  subtype the asset was impaired upon receipt of notice from merck in october that it was exercising its right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement 
in  roche notified us that they were exercising their right to terminate the collaboration and license agreement with our subsidiary  metabasis 
as a result  we reviewed the carrying amount of the intangible asset related to this agreement 
based on our analysis of available information  we determined that the asset would not generate any future cash flow 
therefore  we wrote off the million of acquired in process research and development associated with the agreement during the year ended december  accretion of deferred gain on sale leaseback in  we entered into an agreement for the sale of our real property located in san diego  california for a purchase price of million 
this property  with a net book value of million  included one building totaling approximately  square feet  the land on which the building is situated  and two adjacent vacant lots 
as part of the sale transaction  we agreed to lease back the building for a period of years 
we recognized an immediate pre tax gain on the sale transaction of million in and deferred a gain of million on the sale of the building 
the deferred gain was being recognized as an offset to operating expense on a straight line basis over the year term of the lease at a rate of approximately million per year 
in  we entered into a lease termination agreement for this building 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of accretion of deferred gain during the quarter ended september   and recognized the remaining balance of the deferred gain of million through the term of our new building lease  which expired in december the amount of the deferred gain recognized for the years ended december  and was million  respectively 
the deferred gain was fully amortized as of december   thus no gain was recognized for the year ended december  
table of contents interest income expense  net interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million in and interest income of million in the increase in interest expense of million for the year ended december  compared with was due to the increase in the outstanding balance of notes payable at december  compared to december  additionally  the million loan obtained to acquire cydex in january was outstanding for a partial period for the year ended december  the interest income in of million is the result of interest earned on investments which were liquidated in january and used to acquire cydex 
change in contingent liabilities we recorded an increase in contingent liabilities of million for the year ended december  compared to million for  and a decrease of million for the change relates to our liability for amounts potentially due to holders of cvrs and other former license holders associated with our cydex  metabasis  and neurogen acquisitions 
the metabasis cvr liability is marked to market at each reporting period based upon the quoted market prices of the underlying cvr 
the fair value of the cydex and neurogen contingent liabilities were determined based upon the income approach for the years ended december  and the carrying amount of the liability may fluctuate significantly based upon quoted market prices and actual amounts paid under the agreements may be materially different than the carrying amount of the liability 
other  net we recorded other income of million for the year ended december   compared to million for and million for other income for is primarily due to decreases in liabilities assumed in acquisitions 
other income for primarily relates to income related to the gain on the sale of property and equipment and decreases in liabilities assumed in acquisitions 
other income for primarily relates to grants totaling million in response to applications submitted for qualified investments in a qualifying therapeutic discovery project under section d of the internal revenue code  million in realized gains on investments  million reduction in warrant liability and million of gain on the sale of property and equipment 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  compared to a income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit in was principally the result of net deferred tax liabilities recorded in connection with our acquisition of cydex 
the net deferred tax liabilities assumed in the cydex acquisition became a future source of income to support the realization of deferred tax assets and resulted in the release of a portion of our valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
the income tax benefit in is principally due to a requirement under asc that a company to consider all sources of income in order to determine the tax benefit resulting from a loss from continuing operations 
as a result of the requirement under asc  the pretax income which we generated from discontinued operations was a source of income which resulted in the partial realization of the current year loss from continuing operations 
thus  we recorded an approximate million tax benefit to continuing operations and an offsetting million charge to discontinued operations 
in addition  the company realized a tax benefit as a result of california voters approving legislation in november which required a single sales factor income apportionment methodology beginning in and resulted in a decrease in our future california deferred income tax obligations 
during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to the reversal of estimated interest for a proposed substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal during  the irs issued to us a notice of proposed adjustment  or nopa  seeking an increase to our taxable income for the fiscal year of million and a million penalty for substantial underpayment of tax in fiscal we recorded a liability for uncertain tax positions of million related to the income tax effect of the nopa and million related to estimated interest due on the proposed underpayment of tax 
we also recorded deferred income tax assets of million associated with the ability to carry back losses from and to offset the nopa 
in addition  we recorded an income tax receivable of million associated with changes in income tax law in relation to prior amt taxes paid on carry back periods 
in november  the irs granted us an extension of time to make a closing of the books election with respect to an ownership change  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  for the tax year 
we filed an amended federal tax return in the fourth quarter of in addition  in january  we were notified by the irs that they had completed their examination resulting in no changes to the taxes for our tax year 

table of contents discontinued operations  net oncology product line in  we sold our oncology product line to eisai  including  among other things  all related inventory  equipment  records and intellectual property  and assumed certain liabilities 
for the year ended december   we recognized a pretax gain of million  due to subsequent changes in certain estimates of assets and liabilities recorded as of the sale date 
avinza product line in  we sold our avinza product line to king  including  among other things  all avinza inventory  records and related intellectual property  and the transfer of certain liabilities 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized pre tax gains of million   and million  respectively  due to subsequent changes in certain estimates of assets and liabilities recorded as of the sale date 
income tax expense on discontinued operations in  we recorded income tax expense on discontinued operations of million 
see discussion on income taxes above 
there was no income tax expense on discontinued operations for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through offerings of our equity securities  borrowings from long term debt  issuance of convertible notes  product sales and the subsequent sales of our commercial assets  royalties  collaborative research and development and other revenues  capital and operating lease transactions 
we have incurred significant losses since inception 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million and we had negative working capital of million 
we believe that cash flows from operations will improve due to consistent captisol sales  an increase in royalty revenues driven primarily from continued increases in promacta sales  recent product approvals and regulatory developments  as well as anticipated new license and milestone revenues 
in the event revenues and operating cash flows do not meet expectations  management plans to reduce discretionary expenses 
however  it is possible that we may be required to seek additional financing 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to management  or at all 
we believe our available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty  license and milestone revenues will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating and capital requirements  through at least the next twelve months 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the potential success of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the amount of royalties on sales of the commercial products of our partners  the efforts of our collaborative partners  obligations under our operating lease agreements  and the capital requirements of any companies we acquire  including pharmacopeia  inc pharmacopeia  neurogen corporation neurogen  metabasis therapeutics  inc metabasis and cydex pharmaceuticals  inc cydex 
our ability to achieve our operational targets is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient operating cash flow 
in january  we completed our acquisition of metabasis 
in addition to cash consideration  we issued four tradable contingent value rights cvrs  one cvr from each of four respective series of cvrs  for each metabasis share 
the cvrs will entitle the holder to cash payments as frequently as every six months as cash is received by us from the sale or partnering of any of the metabasis drug development programs  among other triggering events 
we have also committed to spend at least million within months and million within months  in new research and development funding on the metabasis programs 
through december   we estimate that we have spent approximately million of the committed amount 
in january  we entered into a million secured term loan credit facility secured debt with oxford financial group oxford 
the loan was amended in january to increase the secured credit facility to million 
the original million borrowed under the facility bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the additional million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the secured debt  we will make interest only payments through february subsequent to the interest only payments  the note will amortize with principal and interest payments through the 
table of contents remaining term of the loan 
additionally  we must also make an additional final payment equal to of the total amount borrowed which is due at maturity and is being accreted over the life of the loan 
the maturity date of the term loan is august  we also have a cash collateralized revolving credit facility under which we may elect to borrow up to million 
amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate equal to basis points above the prime rate 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility may become due and payable if we fail to maintain a cash balance equal to the amount outstanding under the credit facility 
the maturity date of the revolving credit facility is march  in october  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission sec for the issuance and sale of up to million of equity or other securities  proceeds from which will be used for general corporate purposes 
the form s provides additional financial flexibility for us to sell shares or other securities as needed at any time 
as of december    common shares have been issued under this registration statement for total net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of cydex pharmaceuticals  inc on january   we issued a series of contingent value rights cvr and assumed certain contractual obligations 
we paid the cvr holders million in january and may be required to pay up to an additional million upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones to the cydex cvr holders and former license holders 
in  million was paid to the cydex shareholders upon completion of a licensing agreement with the medicines company for the captisol enabled intravenous formulation of clopidogrel 
an additional million was paid to the cydex shareholders upon acceptance by the fda of the new drug application submitted by onyx and an additional million was paid upon approval by the fda of kyprolis for the potential treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
in addition  we will pay cydex shareholders  for each respective year from through  of all cydex related revenue  but only to the extent that and beginning only when cydex related revenue for such year exceeds million  plus an additional of all cydex related revenue recognized during such year  but only to the extent that and beginning only when aggregate cydex related revenue for such year exceeds million 
we paid million to the cydex shareholders in march for of all cydex related revenue in excess of million 
for the year ended december   cydex related revenue did not exceed million 
pursuant to the cvr agreement  the shareholders representative on behalf of the former cydex shareholders filed a notice of objection with us regarding the calculation of payments due to the cydex former shareholders for the first and second quarters of in addition  the shareholders representative claimed that we exceeded the million financial indebtedness limitation contained in the cvr agreement 
in august  we executed a settlement agreement with the shareholders representative releasing us from all claims 
we are also required by the cydex cvr agreement to dedicate at least five experienced full time employee equivalents per year to the acquired business and to invest at least million per year  inclusive of such employee expenses  in the acquired business  through as of december   we have exceeded our commitment for the year ending december  based on management s plans  including projected increases in captisol sales and royalty revenues  as well as anticipated new license revenue and expense reductions  if necessary  we believe our currently available cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as our current and future royalty  license and milestone revenues will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated operating and capital requirements  through at least the next twelve months 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the pace of scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of these programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  competing technological and market developments  the amount of royalties on sales of our partners commercial products  the efforts of our collaborative partners  obligations under our operating lease agreements  and the capital requirements of any companies we may acquire  including neurogen  metabasis and cydex 
we believe that the actions presently being taken to generate sufficient operating cash flow provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going concern 
while we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate sufficient operating cash flow and in our ability to raise additional funds  there can be no assurances to that effect 
our ability to achieve our operational targets is dependent upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate sufficient operating cash flow

other in july  we purchased million of commercial paper issued by golden key ltd 
the investment was highly rated and within our investment policy at the time of purchase  but during the third quarter of  large credit rating agencies downgraded the quality of this security 
in addition  as a result of not meeting certain liquidity covenants  the assets of golden key ltd 
were assigned to a trustee who established a committee of the largest senior credit holders to determine the next steps  at which point the investment was written down 
subsequently  golden key ltd 
defaulted on its obligation to settle the security on the stated maturity date of october  during  the assets of golden key ltd 
were sold through an auction process and  as a result  the company received a final cash distribution of approximately million  of which million was recognized as a gain 
in connection with the acquisition of pharmacopeia in december  pharmacopeia security holders received a cvr that entitled them to an aggregate cash payment of million under certain circumstances 
the cvr expired on december  in connection with the acquisition of neurogen in december  neurogen security holders received cvrs under four cvr agreements 
the cvrs entitle neurogen shareholders to cash payments upon the sale or licensing of certain assets and upon the achievement of a specified clinical milestone 
the fair value of the neurogen cvr at december  was million and related to programs for h and vr in  we received a notice from a collaboration partner that it was terminating its agreement related to vr for convenience and the company recorded a decrease in the fair value of the liability for the related contingent value right of million 
additionally  per the cvr agreement  no payment event date related to the h asset can occur after december  and we recorded a decrease in the fair value of the liability for the related contingent value right of million 
there are no remaining cvr obligations under the agreement with the former neurogen shareholders 
in connection with the acquisition of metabasis in january  metabasis security holders received cvrs under four cvr agreements 
the cvrs entitle the holders to cash payments upon the sale or licensing of certain assets and upon the achievement of specified milestones 
the fair value of the liability at december  and was and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of cydex in january  we issued a series of cvr and assumed certain contingent liabilities for payments due to former license holders 
we paid the cvr holders million in january and may be required to pay up to an additional million upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones to the cvr holders and former license holders 
in  million was paid to the cydex shareholders upon completion of a licensing agreement with the medicines company for the captisol enabled intravenous formulation of clopidogrel 
in  an additional million was paid to the cydex shareholders upon acceptance by the fda of onyx s nda and million was paid upon approval by the fda 
in addition  we will pay cydex shareholders  for each respective year from through  of all cydex related revenue  but only to the extent that and beginning only when cydex related revenue for such year exceed million  plus an additional of all cydex related revenue recognized during such year  but only to the extent that and beginning only when aggregate cydex related revenue for such year exceeds million  of which million was paid for for the year ended december   revenue did not exceed million 
the fair value of the liability at december  and was million and million  respectively 
leases and off balance sheet arrangements we lease our office and research facilities under operating lease arrangements with varying terms through november the agreements provide for increases in annual rents based on changes in the consumer price index or fixed percentage increases ranging from to 
commencing in january  we also sublease a portion of our facilities through july the sublease agreement provides for a increase in annual rents 
we had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  and contractual obligations 
table of contents as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations we lease office and research facilities that we have fully vacated under operating lease arrangements expiring in july and august we sublet portions of these facilities through the end of our lease 
as of december   we expect to receive aggregate future minimum lease payments totaling million nondiscounted over the duration of the sublease agreement as follows and not included in the table above less than one year  million  two to three years  million  four to five years  million  and more than five years  we outsource the production of captisol to hovione  llc 
under the terms of the supply agreement with hovione  we have ongoing minimum annual purchase commitments and are required to purchase a total of million of captisol over the term of the supply agreement which expires in december through december   we have exceeded that commitment 
either party may terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach or bankruptcy of the other party or an extended force majeure event 
we may also terminate the supply agreement for extended supply interruption  regulatory action related to captisol or other specified events 
under the terms of our merger with metabasis  we are committed to spend at least million within months following the close of the transaction and million within months in new research and development funding on the metabasis programs 
through december   we estimate that we have spent approximately million of the committed amount 
we are also required under our cydex cvr agreement to invest at least million per year  inclusive of employee expenses  in the acquired business  through through december   we have exceeded our committed amount 
critical accounting policies certain of our policies require the application of management judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates made 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition material sales revenue is recognized upon transfer of title  which normally passes upon shipment to the customer 
royalties on sales of products commercialized by our partners are recognized in the quarter reported by the respective partner 
revenue from research funding under our collaboration agreements is earned and recognized on a percentage of completion basis as research hours are incurred in accordance with the provisions of each agreement 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under our collaboration agreements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
amounts received under multiple element arrangements requiring ongoing services or performance by us are recognized over the period of such services or performance 
the company occasionally has sub license obligations related to arrangements for which it receives license fees  milestones and royalties 
we evaluate the determination of gross versus net reporting based on each individual agreement 
we analyze our revenue arrangements and other agreements to determine whether there are multiple elements that should be separated and accounted for individually or as a single unit of accounting 
for multiple element contracts  arrangement consideration is allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables on the basis of relative selling price  using a hierarchy to determine selling price 
we first consider vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  then third party evidence tpe and if neither vsoe nor tpe exist  we use our best estimate of selling price 
many of our revenue arrangements involve the bundling of a license with the option to purchase manufactured product 
licenses are granted to pharmaceutical companies for the use of captisol in the development of pharmaceutical compounds 
the licenses may be granted for the use of the captisol product for all phases of clinical trials and through commercial 
table of contents availability of the host drug or may be limited to certain phases of the clinical trial process 
we believe that our licenses have stand alone value at the outset of an arrangement because the customer obtains the right to use captisol in its formulations without any additional input by us  and in a hypothetical stand alone transaction  the customer would be able to procure inventory from another manufacturer in the absence of contractual provisions for exclusive supply by us 
revenue from milestones is recognized when earned  as evidenced by written acknowledgement from the collaborator  provided that i the milestone event is substantive  its achievability was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  and we have no further performance obligations relating to that event  and ii collectability is reasonably assured 
if these criteria are not met  the milestone payment is recognized over the remaining period of our performance obligations under the arrangement or when received 
inventory inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we determine cost using the first in  first out method 
we analyze our inventory levels periodically and writes down inventory to its net realizable value if it has become obsolete  has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements 
co promote termination accounting as part of the termination and return of co promotion rights agreement that we entered into with organon in january  we agreed to make quarterly payments to organon  effective for the fourth quarter of  equal to of avinza net sales through december  and thereafter through patent expiration  currently anticipated to be november the estimated fair value of the amounts to be paid to organon after the termination  based on the future estimated net sales of the product  was recognized as a liability and expensed as a cost of the termination as of the effective date of the agreement 
in connection with the avinza sale transaction  king assumed our obligation to make payments to organon based on net sales of avinza the fair value of which approximated million as of december  
as organon has not consented to the legal assignment of the co promote termination obligation from us to king  we remain liable to organon in the event of king s default of this obligation 
therefore  we recorded an asset on february  to recognize king s assumption of the obligation  while continuing to carry the co promote termination liability in our consolidated financial statements to recognize our legal obligation as primary obligor to organon 
this asset represents a non interest bearing receivable for future payments to be made by king and is recorded at its fair value 
as of december  and thereafter  the receivable and liability will remain equal and adjusted each quarter for changes in the fair value of the obligation 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews the carrying value and assesses the co promote termination receivable for impairment eg in the event king defaults on the assumed obligation to pay organon 
annually management also reviews the carrying value of the co promote termination liability 
due to assumptions and judgments inherent in determining the estimates of future net avinza sales through november  the actual amount of net avinza sales used to determine the amount of the asset and liability for a particular period may be materially different from current estimates 
any resulting changes to the co promote termination liability will have a corresponding impact on the co promote termination payments receivable 
as of december  and  the fair value of the co promote termination liability and the corresponding receivable was determined using a discount rate of 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value of our long lived assets is determined using the expected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
as of december   we believe that the future discounted cash flows to be received from our long lived assets will exceed the assets carrying value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefit or if future deductibility is uncertain 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as recoverability was uncertain 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any 
table of contents valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by these taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
our ending deferred tax liability represents liabilities for which we cannot estimate the reversal period and therefore cannot be used as support for our deferred tax assets 
share based compensation share based compensation cost for awards to employees and non employee directors is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period until the last tranche vests 
compensation cost for consultant awards is recognized over each separate tranche s vesting period 
we recognized compensation expense of million  million  and million for   and  respectively  associated with option awards  restricted stock and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value for options that were awarded to employees and directors was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions year ended december  risk free interest rate dividend yield expected volatility expected term years years years the expected term of the employee and non employee director options is the estimated weighted average period until exercise or cancellation of vested options forfeited unvested options are not considered based on historical experience 
the expected term for consultant awards is the remaining period to contractual expiration 
volatility is a measure of the expected amount of variability in the stock price over the expected life of an option expressed as a standard deviation 
in selecting this assumption  we used the historical volatility of our stock price over a period equal to the expected term 
changes in the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock based compensation would impact the amount of compensation expenses recognized during the period 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss 
this asu represents the converged guidance of the fasb and the iasb the boards on fair value measurement 
the collective efforts of the boards and their staffs  reflected in asu no 
 have resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements  including a consistent meaning of the term fair value 
asu no 
amends asc  fair value measurements and disclosures to provide guidance on how fair value measurement should be applied where existing us gaap already requires or permits fair value measurements 
this asu does not extend the use of fair value  but rather provides guidance on application 
in addition  asu no 
requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
our adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income 
this asu amends topic  comprehensive income  to allow an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
asu no 
eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in shareholders investment 
the amendments to the codification in the asu do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
our adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing for goodwill impairment  which  among other things  amends accounting standards topic intangibles goodwill and other  to allow entities to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
asu permits an entity to first perform a qualitative assessment 
table of contents to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
if it is concluded that this is the case  it is necessary to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test 
otherwise  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
our adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued asu  deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in asu the amendments in asu defer the changes in asu that relate to the presentation of reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendments in this asu are effective for us for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  we adopted this standard for the year ended december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment in asu asu allows a company the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test 
under that option  a company would no longer be required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset unless the company determines  based on that qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
the amendments in this asu are effective for annual and interim indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests performed for periods beginning after september  we adopted this standard for the year ended december  the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
under asu  an entity is required to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
asu does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income in the financial statements 
the amendments in this asu are effective for us for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our investment portfolio included investments in available for sale equity securities of million 
these securities are subject to market risk and may decline in value based on market conditions 
additionally  we are subject to a one year trading restriction on these investments 
we purchase captisol from hovione  located in lisbon  portugal 
payments to hovione are denominated and paid in us dollars  however the unit price of captisol contains an adjustment factor which is based on the sharing of foreign currency risk between the two parties 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would have an immaterial impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to market risk involving rising interest rates 
to the extent interest rates rise  our interest costs could increase 
an increase in interest costs of would have no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
