item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and we do not undertake to update these forward looking statements  except as required by law 

table of contents part i item business costco wholesale corporation and its subsidiaries costco or the company began operations in in seattle  washington 
we are principally engaged in the operation of membership warehouses in the united states us and puerto rico  canada  the united kingdom uk  mexico  japan  australia  and through majority owned subsidiaries in taiwan and korea 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol cost 
in and prior to the july acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in our joint venture in mexico  the financial position and results of mexico operations were consolidated  and the joint venture partner share was included in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income 
subsequent to the acquisition  we have included of mexico operations within net income attributable to costco in the consolidated statements of income 
we report on a week fiscal year  consisting of thirteen  four week periods and ending on the sunday nearest the end of august 
the first three quarters consist of three periods each  and the fourth quarter consists of four periods five weeks in the thirteenth period in a week year 
the material seasonal impact in our operations is an increased level of net sales and earnings during the winter holiday season 
references to and relate to the week fiscal years ended september  and august   respectively 
references to relate to the week fiscal year ended september  general we operate membership warehouses based on the concept that offering our members low prices on a limited selection of nationally branded and select private label products in a wide range of merchandise categories will produce high sales volumes and rapid inventory turnover 
this turnover  when combined with the operating efficiencies achieved by volume purchasing  efficient distribution and reduced handling of merchandise in no frills  self service warehouse facilities  enables us to operate profitably at significantly lower gross margins than traditional wholesalers  mass merchandisers  supermarkets  and supercenters 
we buy the majority of our merchandise directly from manufacturers and route it to a cross docking consolidation point depot or directly to our warehouses 
our depots receive container based shipments from manufacturers and reallocate these goods for shipment to our individual warehouses  generally in less than twenty four hours 
this process maximizes freight volume and handling efficiencies  eliminating many of the costs associated with traditional multiple step distribution channels 
such traditional steps include purchasing from distributors as opposed to manufacturers  use of central receiving  storing and distributing warehouses  and storage of merchandise in locations off the sales floor 
because of our high sales volume and rapid inventory turnover  we generally sell inventory before we are required to pay many of our merchandise vendors  even though we take advantage of early payment discounts when available 
to the extent that sales increase and inventory turnover becomes more rapid  a greater percentage of inventory is financed through payment terms provided by suppliers rather than by our working capital 
our typical warehouse format averages approximately  square feet  newer units tend to be slightly larger 
floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space  the handling of merchandise  and the control of inventory 
because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and the availability of low prices  our warehouses are not elaborate facilities 
by strictly controlling the entrances and exits of our warehouses and using a membership format  we have limited inventory losses shrinkage to amounts well below those of typical discount retail operations 
marketing and promotional activities generally relate to new warehouse openings  occasional direct mail to prospective new members  and regular direct marketing programs such as the costco connection  a magazine we publish for our members  coupon mailers  emails from costco 
com  costco 
ca  and costco 
co 
uk  and handouts to existing members promoting selected merchandise 
our warehouses generally operate on a seven day  hour week  open weekdays between am and am  with earlier weekend closing hours 
gasoline operations generally have extended hours 
because the hours of operation are shorter than those of traditional retailers  discount retailers and supermarkets  and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse type operation  labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales 
merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities  thereby reducing labor required for handling and stocking 
our strategy is to provide our members with a broad range of high quality merchandise at prices consistently lower than they can obtain elsewhere 
we seek to limit specific items in each product line to fast selling models  sizes  and colors 
therefore  
table of contents item business continued we carry an average of approximately  active stock keeping units skus per warehouse in our core warehouse business  as opposed to a significantly higher number of skus at discount retailers  supermarkets  and supercenters 
many consumable products are offered for sale in case  carton  or multiple pack quantities only 
in keeping with our policy of member satisfaction  we generally accept returns of merchandise 
on certain electronic items  we typically have a day return policy and provide  free of charge  technical support services  as well as an extended warranty 
additional third party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic item purchases 
the following table indicates the approximate percentage of annual net sales accounted for by major category of items sundries including candy  snack foods  tobacco  alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages and cleaning and institutional supplies hardlines including major appliances  electronics  health and beauty aids  hardware  office supplies  cameras  garden and patio  sporting goods  toys  seasonal items and automotive supplies food including dry and institutionally packaged foods softlines including apparel  domestics  jewelry  housewares  media  home furnishings and small appliances fresh food including meat  bakery  deli and produce ancillary and other including gas stations  pharmacy  food court  optical  one hour photo  hearing aid and travel ancillary businesses within or next to our warehouses provide expanded products and services and encourage members to shop more frequently 
the following table indicates the number of ancillary businesses in operation at fiscal year end food court one hour photo centers optical dispensing centers pharmacies hearing aid centers gas stations number of warehouses our online business  which operates websites in the us  canada  and the uk  provide our members additional products  many not found in our warehouses 
these products vary by country and include services such as photo center  pharmacy  travel  business delivery  and membership services 
net sales for our online business were approximately of our consolidated net sales 
in general and depending on the country  our warehouses accept cash  checks  certain debit cards  american express  or a private label costco credit card 
losses associated with dishonored checks have been minimal  as members who have issued dishonored checks are identified and prevented from making further purchases until restitution is made 
we have direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand name merchandise 
we do not obtain a significant portion of merchandise from any one supplier 
we have not experienced any difficulty in obtaining sufficient quantities of merchandise  and believe that if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable  we would be able to obtain alternative sources without substantial disruption of our business 
we also purchase private label merchandise  as long as quality and customer demand are comparable and the value to our members is greater as compared to brand name items 
certain financial information for our segments and geographic areas is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 

table of contents item business continued membership our membership format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue 
members can utilize their membership at any costco warehouse location in any country 
we have two types of members business and gold star individual 
business membership is limited to businesses  including individuals with a business license  retail sales license or other evidence of business existence 
business members pay an annual membership fee of approximately for the primary cardholder  and have the ability to add additional cardholders add ons for an annual fee of approximately each 
gold star memberships are also available for an annual fee of approximately to individuals who may not qualify for a business membership  however add ons are not available for gold star memberships 
all paid memberships include a free household card 
our member renewal rate was approximately in the us and canada  and approximately on a worldwide basis in the renewal rate is a trailing calculation that captures renewals during the period seven to eighteen months prior to the reporting date 
our membership was made up of the following in thousands gold star business business  add on total paid cardholders additional cardholders total cardholders all members are eligible for an executive membership  with the exception of business add on members  in the us  canada  mexico  and the united kingdom  for an annual fee of approximately executive members qualify for a annual reward which can be redeemed at costco warehouses  up to a maximum of approximately per year  on qualified purchases 
this program also offers except in mexico additional savings and benefits on various business and consumer services  such as check printing services  the costco auto purchase program  auto and home insurance  online investing and identity protection 
the services are generally provided by third parties and vary by country and state 
at the end of   and  executive members represented of eligible cardholders 
executive members generally spend more than other members  and the percentage of our net sales attributable to these members continues to increase 
effective november   for new members  and january   for renewing members  we increased our annual membership fee in the us and canada 
please refer to management discussion and analysis in item of this report for further explanation of the change and its impact 
labor our employee count approximated full time employees part time employees total employees approximately  hourly employees in certain of our locations in five states are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters 
all remaining employees are non union 
we consider our employee relations to be very good 

table of contents item business continued competition our industry is highly competitive  based on factors such as price  merchandise quality and selection  warehouse location and member service 
we compete with over warehouse club locations across the us and canada primarily wal mart s sam s club and bj s wholesale club  and every major metropolitan area has multiple club operations 
in addition  we compete with a wide range of global  national and regional wholesalers and retailers  including supermarkets  supercenter stores  department and specialty stores  gasoline stations  and internet based retailers 
competitors such as wal mart  target  kohl s and amazon 
com are among our significant general merchandise retail competitors 
we also compete with operators selling a single category or narrow range of merchandise  such as lowe s  home depot  office depot  petsmart  staples  kroger  trader joe s  whole foods  cvs  walgreens and best buy 
our international operations face similar competition 
intellectual property we believe that  to varying degrees  our trademarks  trade names  copyrights  proprietary processes  trade secrets  patents  trade dress  domain names and similar intellectual property add significant value to our business and are important factors in our success 
we have invested significantly in the development and protection of our well recognized brands  including the costco wholesale series of trademarks and our private label brand  kirkland signature 
we believe that kirkland signature products are premium products offered to our members at prices that are generally lower than those for national brand products and that they help lower costs  differentiate our merchandise offerings from other retailers  and generally earn higher margins 
we expect to increase the sales penetration of our private label items in the future 
we rely on trademark and copyright laws  trade secret protection  and confidentiality and license agreements with our suppliers  employees and others to protect our proprietary rights 
the availability and duration of trademark registrations vary from country to country  however  trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and their registrations are properly maintained

table of contents item a risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks are not the only risks that we face 
we could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the us and globally  as well as other risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial 
you should review these risk factors carefully in conjunction with management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item and our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
business and operating risks we are highly dependent on the financial performance of our us and canadian operations 
our financial and operational performance is highly dependent on our us and canadian operations  which comprised and of consolidated net sales and operating income in  respectively 
within the us  we are highly dependent on our california operations  which comprised of consolidated net sales in our california market  in general  has a larger percentage of higher volume warehouses as compared to our other markets 
any substantial slowing or sustained decline in these operations could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
declines in financial performance of our us operations  particularly in california  and our canadian operations could arise from  among other things failing to meet targets for warehouse openings  declines in actual or estimated comparable warehouse sales growth rates and expectations  negative trends in operating expenses  including increased labor  healthcare and energy costs  cannibalizing existing locations with new warehouses  shifts in sales mix toward lower gross margin products  changes or uncertainties in economic conditions in our markets  including higher levels of unemployment and depressed home values  and failing to consistently provide high quality products and innovative new products to retain our existing member base and attract new members 
we may be unsuccessful implementing our growth strategy  including expanding our business  both in existing markets and in new markets  which could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future growth is dependent  in part  on our ability to acquire property  and build or lease new warehouses 
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations 
local land use and other regulations restricting the construction and operation of our warehouses  as well as local community actions opposed to the location of our warehouses at specific sites and the adoption of local laws restricting our operations and environmental regulations may impact our ability to find suitable locations  and increase the cost of constructing  leasing and operating our warehouses 
we also may have difficulty negotiating leases or real estate purchase agreements on acceptable terms 
in addition  certain jurisdictions have enacted or proposed laws and regulations that would prevent or restrict the operation or expansion plans of certain large retailers and warehouse clubs  including us  within their jurisdictions 
failure to manage these and other similar factors effectively may affect our ability to timely build or lease new warehouses  which could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and profitability 
we seek to expand our business in existing markets in order to attain a greater overall market share 
because our warehouses typically draw members from their local areas  a new warehouse may draw members away from our existing warehouses and adversely affect comparable warehouse sales performance and member traffic at those existing warehouses 
we also intend to open warehouses in new markets 
the risks associated with entering a new market include difficulties in attracting members due to a lack of familiarity with us  attracting members of other wholesale club operators currently operating in the new market  our lack of familiarity with local member preferences  and seasonal differences in the market 
in addition  entry into new markets may bring us into competition with new competitors or with existing competitors with a large  established market presence 
in new markets  we cannot ensure that our new warehouses will be profitably deployed and  as a result  our future profitability could be delayed or otherwise materially adversely affected 
our failure to maintain positive membership loyalty and brand recognition could adversely affect our results of operations 
membership loyalty is essential to our business model 
damage to our brands or reputation may negatively impact comparable warehouse sales  lower employee morale and productivity  diminish member trust  and reduce member renewal rates and  accordingly  membership fee revenues  resulting in a reduction in shareholder value 
in addition  we sell many products under our owned and exclusive kirkland signature brand 
maintaining consistent product quality  competitive pricing  and availability of our kirkland signature products for our customers is essential to developing and 
table of contents item a risk factors continued maintaining customer loyalty 
these products also generally carry higher margins than national brand products and represent a growing portion of our overall sales 
if the kirkland signature brand experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence  our sales and gross margin results could be adversely affected 
disruptions in our depot operations could adversely affect sales and member satisfaction 
we depend on the orderly operation of the merchandise receiving and distribution process  primarily through our depots 
although we believe that our receiving and distribution process is efficient  unforeseen disruptions in operations due to fires  hurricanes  earthquakes or other catastrophic events  labor shortages or shipping problems  may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our warehouses  which could adversely affect sales and the satisfaction of our members 
we rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions  summarize results and manage our business 
failure to adequately update our systems and disruptions in both our primary and back up systems could harm our ability to run our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
although we believe that we have independent  redundant primary and secondary computer systems  given the number of individual transactions we have each year it is important that we maintain uninterrupted operation of our business critical computer systems 
our computer systems  including our back up systems  are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  computer and telecommunications failures  computer viruses  internal or external security breaches  catastrophic events such as fires  earthquakes  tornadoes and hurricanes  and errors by our employees 
if our computer systems and our back up systems are damaged or cease to function properly  we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace them  and we may suffer interruptions in our operations in the interim 
any material interruption in our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
we are currently making  and will continue to make  significant technology investments to transform our information processes and systems that are key to managing our business 
we must monitor and choose the right investments and implement them at the right pace 
the risk of system disruption is increased when significant system changes are undertaken  although we believe that our change management process will mitigate this risk 
excessive technological change could impact the effectiveness of adoption  and could make it more difficult for us to realize benefits from the technology 
targeting the wrong opportunities  failing to make the best investments  or making an investment commitment significantly above or below our needs could result in the loss of our competitive position and adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the potential problems and interruptions associated with implementing technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations in the short term 
these initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or may provide them on a delayed schedule or at a higher cost 
if we do not maintain the privacy and security of member related and business information  we could damage our reputation with members  incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation 
we receive  retain  and transmit certain personal information about our members and entrust that information to third party business associates  including cloud service providers who perform these activities for us 
our online business  which operates websites in the us  canada  and the us  depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including information permitting cashless payments 
a compromise of our security systems or those of our business associates that results in our members personal information being obtained by unauthorized persons could adversely affect our reputation with our members and others  as well as our operations  results of operations  financial condition and liquidity  and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties 
in addition  a security breach could require that we expend significant additional resources related to the security of information systems and could result in a disruption of our operations  particularly our online business 
additionally  the use of individually identifiable data by our business and our business associates is regulated at the national and local or state level in all of our operating countries 
privacy and information security laws and regulations change  and compliance with them may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes 
if we  or those with whom we share information  fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach  our reputation could be damaged  possibly resulting in lost future business  and we could be subjected to additional legal risk as a result of non compliance 
our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties  employee error  malfeasance  or otherwise  and  as a result  an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information 
because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access  disable or degrade service  or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or 
table of contents item a risk factors continued to implement adequate preventative measures 
any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure  damage to our reputation  and potentially have an adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to payment related risks 
we accept payments using a variety of methods  including cash and checks  various select credit and debit cards  and our proprietary cash card 
as we offer new payment options to our members  we may be subject to additional rules  regulations  compliance requirements  and higher fraud losses 
for certain payment methods  we pay interchange and other related card acceptance fees  along with additional transaction processing fees which may increase over time and raise our operating costs 
we rely on third parties to provide payment transaction processing services  including the processing of credit and debit cards  and our proprietary cash card  and it could temporarily disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us 
we are also subject to payment card association rules and network operating rules  including data security rules  certification requirements and rules governing electronic funds transfers  which could change over time 
if we fail to comply with these rules or transaction processing requirements  we may not be able to accept certain payment methods 
in addition  if our internal systems are breached or compromised  we may be liable for banks compromised card re issuance costs  subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and or debit card payments from our members  and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we are subject to the risks of selling unsafe products which could result in illness or injury to our members  harm our reputation and subject us to litigation 
if our merchandise offerings  including food and prepared food products for human consumption  drugs  children products  and pet products  do not meet or are perceived not to meet applicable safety standards or our members expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales  increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
the sale of these items involves the risk of health related illness or injury to our members 
such illnesses or injuries could result from tampering by unauthorized third parties  product contamination or spoilage  including the presence of foreign objects  substances  chemicals  other agents  or residues introduced during the growing  manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation phases 
our vendors are generally contractually required to comply with applicable product safety laws  and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards 
while we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and work to comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations  we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health related illness or injury in the future or that we will not be subject to claims  lawsuits or government investigations relating to such matters resulting in costly product recalls and other liabilities that could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued  the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential members and our corporate and brand image and these effects could be long term 
if we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant multichannel experience for our members  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
multichannel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing member expectations and new developments by our competitors 
our members are increasingly using computers  tablets  mobile phones  and other devices to shop online 
as part of our multichannel strategy  we are making technology investments in our websites and recently launched a mobile application for mobile phones and other electronic devices 
if we are unable to make  improve  or develop relevant member facing technology in a timely manner  our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our inability to attract  train and retain highly qualified employees could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree on the continued contributions of members of our senior management and other key operations  merchandising and administrative personnel  and the loss of any such person s could have a material adverse effect on our business 
other than an annual agreement with our ceo  mr 
jelinek  we have no employment agreements with our officers 
we must attract  train and retain a large and growing number of highly qualified employees  while controlling related labor costs and maintaining our core values 
our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors  including regulatory changes  prevailing wage rates  and healthcare and other insurance costs 
we compete with other retail and non retail businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them 
there is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly qualified employees in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man insurance 

table of contents item a risk factors continued failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock 
we believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results 
any failure to meet or delay in meeting these expectations  including our comparable warehouse sales growth rates  margins  earnings and earnings per share or new warehouse openings could cause the market price of our stock to decline  as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase policies 
market and other external risks we face strong competition from other retailers and warehouse club operators  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the retail business is highly competitive 
we compete for members  employees  sites  products and services and in other important respects with a wide range of local  regional and national wholesalers and retailers  both in the united states and in foreign countries  including other warehouse club operators  supermarkets  supercenter stores  department and specialty stores  gasoline stations  and internet based retailers 
such retailers and warehouse club operators compete in a variety of ways  including merchandise pricing  selection and availability  services  location  convenience  and store hours 
the evolution of retailing in online and mobile channels has improved the ability of members to comparison shop with digital tools  which has enhanced competition 
our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures  changes in the retail markets and member expectations could result in lost market share and negatively affect our financial results 
some competitors may have greater financial resources  better access to merchandise and greater market penetration than we do 
general economic factors  domestically and internationally  may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
higher energy costs  inflation  levels of unemployment  healthcare costs  consumer debt levels  foreign currency exchange rates  unsettled financial markets  weaknesses in housing and real estate markets  reduced consumer confidence  changes related to government fiscal and tax policies  sovereign debt crises  and other economic factors could adversely affect demand for our products and services or require a change in the mix of products we sell 
prices of certain commodity products  including gasoline and other food products  are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand  labor costs  competition  market speculation  government regulations  taxes and periodic delays in delivery 
rapid and significant changes in commodity prices may affect our sales and profit margins 
these factors could also increase our merchandise costs and or selling  general and administrative expenses  and otherwise adversely affect our operations and financial results 
general economic conditions can also be affected by the outbreak of war  acts of terrorism  or other significant national or international events 
we may not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends  which could negatively affect our relationship with our members  the demand for our products and services  and our market share 
it is difficult to consistently and successfully predict the products and services our members will demand 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to identify and respond to trends in demographics and consumer preferences 
failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes  preferences including those relating to sustainability of product sources and spending patterns could negatively affect our relationship with our members  the demand for our products and services and our market share 
if we are not successful at predicting our sales trends and adjusting our purchases accordingly  we may have excess inventory  which could result in additional markdowns and reduce our operating performance 
this could have an adverse effect on margins net sales less merchandise costs and operating income 
vendors may be unable to supply us with quality merchandise at the right prices in a timely manner or may fail to adhere to our high standards resulting in adverse effects on our business  merchandise inventories  sales and profit margins 
we depend heavily on our ability to purchase merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices 
we have no assurances of continued supply  pricing or access to new products  and any vendor could at any time change the terms upon which it sells to us or discontinue selling to us 
member demands may lead to out of stock positions of our merchandise leading to loss of sales and profits 

table of contents item a risk factors continued we purchase our merchandise from numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers and importers and have thousands of vendor relationships 
our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key vendors could negatively affect us 
we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors  and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality or more expensive than those from existing vendors 
because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited  particularly for certain food items  the large volume we demand may not be consistently available 
our suppliers are subject to risks  including labor disputes  union organizing activities  financial liquidity  inclement weather  natural disasters  supply constraints  and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable merchandise 
for these or other reasons  one or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control  legal or regulatory standards 
these deficiencies may delay or preclude delivery of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members 
this failure could lead to litigation and recalls  which could damage our reputation and our brands  increase our costs  and otherwise adversely impact our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
natural disasters  such as hurricanes  typhoons or earthquakes  particularly in california or in washington state  where our centralized operating systems and administrative personnel are located  could negatively affect our operations and financial performance 
such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our properties  the temporary closure of one or more warehouses or depots  the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market  the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from some local or overseas suppliers  the temporary disruption in the transport of goods to or from overseas  delays in the delivery of goods to our warehouses or depots within the countries in which we operate  and the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our warehouses 
public health issues  whether occurring in the us or abroad  could disrupt our operations  disrupt the operations of suppliers or members  or have an adverse impact on consumer spending and confidence levels 
these events could also reduce demand for our products or make it difficult or impossible to receive products from suppliers 
we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our locations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
factors associated with climate change could adversely affect our business 
we use natural gas  diesel fuel  gasoline  and electricity in our distribution and warehouse operations 
increased u 
s and foreign government and agency regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs and legislation or regulation affecting energy inputs that could materially affect our profitability 
in addition  climate change could affect our ability to procure needed commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience 
we also sell a substantial amount of gasoline  the demand for which could be impacted by concerns about climate change and which also could face increased regulation 
climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions  such as more intense hurricanes  thunderstorms  tornadoes and snow or ice storms  as well as rising sea levels 
extreme weather conditions increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured 
legal and regulatory risks our international operations subject us to risks associated with the legislative  judicial  accounting  regulatory  political and economic factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  our international operations  including canada  generated of our consolidated net sales 
we plan to continue expanding our international operations 
as a result of these expansion activities in countries outside the us  we expect that our international operations could account for a larger portion of our net sales in future years 
future operating results internationally could be negatively affected by a variety of factors  many similar to those we face in the us  but many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include political conditions  economic conditions  regulatory constraints  currency regulations and exchange rates  and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate  now or in the future 
other factors that may impact international operations include foreign trade  monetary and fiscal policies and the laws and regulations of the us and foreign governments  agencies and similar organizations  and risks associated with having major facilities located in countries which have been historically less stable than the us risks inherent in international operations also include  among others  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations  adverse tax consequences  and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights 
additionally  foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations could have an adverse impact on our future costs or on future profits and cash flows from our international operations 

table of contents item a risk factors continued changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our financial condition and results of operations 
generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements  implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business  including  but not limited to  revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  merchandise inventories  vendor rebates and other vendor consideration  self insurance liabilities  income taxes  unclaimed property laws and litigation  and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions  estimates and judgments by our management 
changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions  estimates or judgments by our management could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance 
provisions for losses related to self insured risks are generally based upon independent actuarially determined estimates 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses can be highly unpredictable  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities and could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we could be subject to additional income tax liabilities 
we compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the countries in which we operate 
as the tax rates vary among countries  a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision 
additionally  any change in the enacted tax rates  any adverse outcome in connection with any income tax audits in any jurisdiction  including transfer pricing disputes  or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
significant changes in  or failure to comply with  federal  state  regional  local and international laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials  hazardous and non hazardous wastes and other environmental matters could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to a wide variety of federal  state  regional  local and international laws and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous materials  hazardous and non hazardous wastes and other environmental matters 
any failure to comply with these laws could result in significant costs to satisfy environmental compliance  remediation or compensatory requirements  or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by governmental agencies or courts that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits and  while we cannot predict the outcomes of such proceedings and other contingencies with certainty  some of these outcomes could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires compliance with a great variety of laws and regulations 
failure to achieve compliance could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings  and lead to damage awards  fines and penalties 
we are  or may become involved  in a number of legal proceedings and audits including grand jury investigations  government and agency investigations  and consumer  employment  tort and other litigation see discussion of legal proceedings in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies  including environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by governmental authorities 
the outcome of some of these legal proceedings  audits  unclaimed property laws  and other contingencies could require us to take  or refrain from taking  actions which could negatively affect our operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions  except per share  membership fee data  and warehouse number data overview we believe that the most important driver of increasing our profitability is sales growth  particularly comparable sales growth 
we define comparable warehouse sales as sales from warehouses open for more than one year  including remodels  relocations and expansions  as well as online sales 
comparable sales growth is achieved through increasing the frequency with which our members shop and the amounts that they spend on each visit 
sales comparisons can also be particularly influenced by two factors that are beyond our control  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to the consolidation of the results of our international operations and changes in the cost of gasoline and associated competitive conditions primarily impacting domestic operations 
the higher our comparable sales exclusive of currency fluctuations  the more we can leverage certain of our selling  general and administrative expenses  reducing them as a percentage of sales and enhancing profitability 
generating comparable sales growth is foremost a question of making available to our members the right merchandise at the right prices  a skill that we believe we have repeatedly demonstrated over the long term 
another substantial factor in sales growth is the health of the economies in which we do business  especially the united states 
sales growth and gross margins are also impacted by our competition  which is vigorous and widespread  including a wide range of global  national and regional wholesalers and retailers  including supermarkets  supercenter stores  and department and specialty stores  gasoline stations  and internet based retailers 
while we cannot control or reliably predict general economic health or changes in competition  we believe that we have been successful historically in adapting our business to these changes  such as through adjustments to our pricing and to our merchandise mix  including increasing the penetration of our private label items 
our philosophy is not to focus in the short term on maximizing prices that our members can be charged  but to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our pricing authority consistently providing the most competitive values 
this may cause us  for example  to absorb increases in merchandise costs at certain times rather than immediately passing them along to our members  negatively impacting gross margin 
we also achieve sales growth by opening new warehouses and  to a much lesser extent  relocating existing warehouses to larger and better located facilities 
as our warehouse base grows  available and desirable potential sites become more difficult to secure  and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth 
however  the negative aspects of such growth  including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses and cannibalization of sales at existing warehouses when openings occur in existing markets  are lessened 
our rate of square footage growth is higher in foreign markets  due to the smaller base in those markets  and we expect that to continue 
our financial performance also depends heavily on our ability to control costs 
while we believe that we have achieved successes in this area historically  some significant costs are partially outside our control  most particularly health care and utility expenses 
with respect to expenses relating to the compensation of our employees  our philosophy is not to seek to minimize the wages and benefits that they earn 
rather  we believe that achieving our longer term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction requires maintaining compensation levels that are better than the industry average for much of our workforce 
this may cause us  for example  to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces 
because our business is operated on very low margins  modest changes in various items in the income statement  particularly gross margin and selling  general and administrative expenses  can have substantial impacts on net income 
our operating model is generally the same across our us  canada  and other international operating segments see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
certain countries in the other international segment have relatively higher rates of square footage growth  lower wages and benefit costs as a percentage of country sales  and or less direct membership warehouse competition 
additionally  we operate our lower margin gasoline business only in the united states and canada 
in discussions of our consolidated operating results  we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the us dollar  which are references to the differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
this impact of foreign exchange rate changes is typically calculated as the difference between the current period currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period currency exchange rates 
our fiscal year ends on the sunday closest to august fiscal years and were week fiscal years ending on september  and august   respectively  while fiscal year was a week fiscal year ending on september  certain percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding 
unless otherwise noted  references to net income relate to net income attributable to costco

critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and judgments 
we continue to review our accounting policies and evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  merchandise inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets  insurance self insurance liabilities  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
for further information on key accounting policies  see discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
revenue recognition we generally recognize sales  which include shipping fees where applicable  net of estimated returns  at the time the member takes possession of merchandise or receives services 
when we collect payment from customers prior to the transfer of ownership of merchandise or the performance of services  the amount received is generally recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets until the sale or service is completed 
we provide for estimated sales returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns  net of the estimated net realizable value of merchandise inventories to be returned and any estimated disposition costs 
amounts collected from members that under common trade practices are referred to as sales taxes are recorded on a net basis 
we evaluate whether it is appropriate to record the gross amount of merchandise sales and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions 
generally  when we are the primary obligor  subject to inventory risk  have latitude in establishing prices and selecting suppliers  influence product or service specifications  or have several but not all of these indicators  revenue and related shipping fees are recorded on a gross basis 
if we are not the primary obligor and do not possess other indicators of gross reporting as noted above  we record the net amounts as commissions earned  which is reflected in net sales 
we account for membership fee revenue  net of estimated refunds  on a deferred basis  whereby revenue is recognized ratably over the one year membership period 
our executive members qualify for a reward up to a maximum of approximately per year  which can be redeemed only at costco warehouses on qualified purchases made at costco warehouses 
we account for this reward as a reduction in sales 
the sales reduction and corresponding liability are computed after giving effect to the estimated impact of non redemptions based on historical data 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations amounts in millions  except per share and share data  membership fee data  and warehouse number data continued investments investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
we employ a methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  or issuer conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  as determined primarily by the retail inventory method  and are stated using the last in  first out lifo method for substantially all us merchandise inventories 
merchandise inventories for all foreign operations are primarily valued by the retail inventory method and are stated using the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe the lifo method more fairly presents the results of operations by more closely matching current costs with current revenues 
we record an adjustment each quarter  if necessary  for the estimated effect of inflation or deflation  and these estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end 
we provide for estimated inventory losses shrink between physical inventory counts as a percentage of net sales 
the provision is adjusted periodically to reflect results of the actual physical inventory counts  which generally occur in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
inventory cost  where appropriate  is reduced by estimates of vendor rebates when earned or as we progress toward earning those rebates  provided they are probable and reasonably estimable 
other consideration received from vendors is generally recorded as a reduction of merchandise costs upon completion of contractual milestones  terms of agreement  or other systematic and rational approaches 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate our long lived assets for indicators of impairment  such as a decision to relocate or close a warehouse facility 
our judgments are based on existing market and operational conditions 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment factors exist  requiring a downward adjustment of these assets to their then current fair market value 
insurance self insurance liabilities we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and participation in a reinsurance pool  to provide for potential liabilities for workers compensation  general liability  property damage  directors and officers liability  vehicle liability  and employee health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are not discounted and are estimated  in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items and the probability of sustaining uncertain tax positions 
the benefits associated with uncertain tax positions are recorded in our consolidated financial statements only after determining a more likely than not probability that the positions will withstand challenge from tax authorities 
when facts and circumstances change  we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the consolidated financial statements as appropriate 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements 
we do not expect these accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity in future periods 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in millions our exposure to financial market risk results from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions or hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment holdings that are diversified among various instruments considered to be cash equivalents as defined in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  as well as short term investments in government and agency securities  and corporate notes and bonds with effective maturities of generally three months to five years at the date of purchase 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and secondarily to generate yields 
the majority of our short term investments are in fixed interest rate securities 
these securities are subject to changes in fair value due to interest rate fluctuations 
our board of directors have approved a policy that limits investments in the us to direct us government and government agency obligations  repurchase agreements collateralized by us government and government agency obligations  and us government and government agency money market funds 
our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary invests in us government and government agency obligations  corporate notes and bonds  and asset and mortgage backed securities with a minimum overall portfolio average credit rating of aa 
our canadian and other international subsidiaries investments are primarily in money market funds  bankers acceptances  bank certificates of deposit and term deposits  generally denominated in their local currencies 
we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact that a basis point change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
at the end of and  the incremental change in the fair market value was immaterial 
for those investments that are classified as available for sale  the unrealized gains or losses related to fluctuations in market volatility and interest rates are reflected within stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the nature and amount of our long term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of the end of  the majority of our long term debt is fixed rate senior notes  carried at  fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of the fixed rate debt and may affect the interest expense related to the variable rate debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for more information on our long term debt 
foreign currency exchange risk our foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in their non functional currencies  which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates 
we manage these fluctuations  in part  through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts  seeking to economically hedge the impact of fluctuations of foreign exchange on known future expenditures denominated in a non functional foreign currency 
the contracts are intended primarily to economically hedge exposure to us dollar merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries whose functional currency is other than the us dollar 
currently  these contracts do not qualify for derivative hedge accounting 
we seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions 
these contracts do not contain any credit risk related contingent features 
we seek to manage counterparty risk associated with these contracts by limiting transactions to counterparties with which we have established banking relationships 
there can be no assurance  however  that this practice effectively mitigates counterparty risk 
these contracts are limited to less than one year in duration 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report for additional information on the fair value of open  unsettled forward foreign exchange contracts at the end of and a hypothetical strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non functional currency exchange rates at september  and september   would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by and  respectively 
commodity price risk we are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy that we consume  particularly electricity and natural gas  which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities  primarily in the us and canada 
we also enter into variable priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas  in addition to fuel for our gas stations  on an index basis 
these contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments  but generally qualify for the normal purchases or normal sales exception under authoritative guidance and  thus  require no mark to market adjustment
