item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary our financial and operating results for improved significantly from the prior year 
total sales  sales of p digital products and sales of new kng products all increased compared with the previous year 
at the same time  costs of products and selling  general and administrative expenses declined 
these factors combined to yield operating income for  compared with an operating loss for additionally  our working capital improved during the year  including an increased cash position 
total sales for increased  to approximately million  compared with approximately million for the prior year  reflecting increased sales of both legacy and kng p digital products as well as sales to new customers  including some internationally 
gross margins as a percentage of sales in were  compared with for the prior year 
the improved gross margins reflect increased sales  particularly of p digital products 
also  unit product costs declined as we improved manufacturing efficiencies for kng products and more fully utilized and absorbed our manufacturing overhead as a result of higher manufacturing volumes 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased approximately million  or  to approximately million compared with million last year 
this decrease was primarily from reductions in engineering expenses as we completed product development initiatives 
we reported pretax income for of approximately million  compared with a pretax loss of  last year 
for  we recognized income tax expense of million  compared with an income tax benefit of  last year 
our income tax expense and benefit are largely non cash  relating to deferred items including net operating loss carryforwards 
net income for was million per basic and diluted share  compared with a net loss of approximately  per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
as of december   working capital totaled approximately million  of which million was comprised of cash and trade receivables 
this compares with working capital totaling approximately million at year end  which included million of cash and trade receivables 
also  as of december  there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to governmental customer spending patterns that are influenced by government fiscal year end budgets and appropriations 
we also experience seasonality in our quarterly results in part due to our concentration of sales to federal and state agencies that participate in fire suppression efforts  which are typically the greatest during the summer season when forest fire activity is heightened 
in some years  these factors may cause an increase in sales for the second and third quarters compared with the first and fourth quarters of the same fiscal year 
such increases in sales may cause quarterly variances in our cash flow from operations and overall financial condition 

table of contents results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table shows items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of sales percent of sales for years ended december sales cost of products gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses net interest expense income loss before income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in increased million to approximately million compared with approximately million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in reached a record level  totaling approximately million of total sales  compared with approximately million for  an increase of million the increase in total sales and p digital sales compared with the prior year was attributed primarily to our p digital products  including both legacy and new kng models 
the broad line of kng products increased our addressable market by offering products in frequencies where we were previously unable to compete 
consequently  we were successful in realizing sales to new customers 
these customers included agencies in state and local governments  as well as international organizations 
they supplement our traditional strongholds in federal agencies  such as the us department of the interior and the us forest service 
for the profile of our total sales was much broader with less reliance on any particular market segment or customer 
looking forward  government and public safety agencies continue to face budget and funding challenges 
however  although fiscal and economic conditions remain uncertain  we are encouraged by the progress we realized in and a growing pipeline of sales opportunities 
we believe we are well positioned with products and technology to build upon the momentum initiated in cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in our cost of products and gross margins are primarily related to material and labor costs  product mix  manufacturing volumes and pricing 
the improvement in cost of products and corresponding gross margins for reflected a favorable mix of product sales weighted toward new kng and legacy p digital products 
additionally  we have continued to better refine the production processes for new kng products  which have yielded lower unit costs 
as a result of the increase in total sales relative to last year  manufacturing volumes increased 
accordingly  we more fully utilized and absorbed our base of manufacturing and support expenses 
we continue to utilize contract manufacturing relationships to maximize production efficiencies and minimize material and labor costs 
we also regularly consider manufacturing alternatives to improve quality  speed and costs 
we anticipate that the current contract manufacturing relationships or comparable alternatives will be available to us in the future 
as demonstrated during  we believe leveraging increased sales volumes and p product sales  combined with the aforementioned manufacturing improvements  should yield gross margin improvements 
we are likely to encounter product cost and competitive pricing pressures in the future  however  the extent of their impact on gross margins is uncertain 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of marketing  sales  commissions  engineering  product development  management information systems  accounting  headquarters expenses and non cash share based employee compensation expense 
for  sg a expenses decreased approximately million to approximately million or of sales  compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses for declined approximately  compared with last year 
the decrease was the result of expense reductions initially implemented during the second quarter last year  and maintained thereafter  as some product development initiatives were completed 
marketing and selling expenses for increased by approximately  compared with last year 
the increase in marketing and selling expenses related primarily to commissions and incentives  which directly correlate with the growth in sales 
those increases were partially offset by expense reductions initially implemented during the second quarter last year and maintained thereafter 
general and administrative expenses for increased by approximately  from last year 
this increase was primarily related to additional headquarters and public company expenses 
operating income loss operating income for totaled approximately million of sales  compared with an operating loss of approximately  of sales for improvement in operating income for the year was primarily due to higher product sales combined with lower product and operating costs 
interest expense  net for  net interest expense totaled  compared with  for the prior year 
we incur interest expense on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and earn interest income on our cash balances 
our revolving credit facility was largely unutilized during the year 
accordingly  very little interest expense was incurred 
the interest rate on our revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense for of approximately million  compared with an income tax benefit of  last year 
our income tax expense and benefit are primarily non cash 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets totaled approximately million  and are primarily composed of net operating loss carry forwards nols 
these nols total million for federal and million for state purposes  with expirations starting in through in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we will need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
asc topic  income taxes  requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of the net deferred tax assets and related tax benefits is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available and current and anticipated customers  contracts and product introductions  as well as historical operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
we have evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
from our evaluation we have concluded that based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the benefit of our net deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  as of december   we maintained a valuation allowance totaling approximately  for the portion of benefit of our federal and state deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized 
we cannot presently estimate what  if any  changes to the valuation of our deferred tax assets may be deemed appropriate in the future 
if we incur future losses  it may be necessary to record additional valuation allowance related to the deferred tax assets recognized as of december  
table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic  income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results during  and  and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year sales  net sales in decreased million to approximately million compared with approximately million for the prior year 
sales of p digital products in decreased approximately million to approximately million  compared with approximately million for the decrease in total sales and p digital sales compared with the prior year was attributed primarily to federal government agencies 
these agencies  including our longstanding legacy customers  faced budget and funding constraints during the year 
the enactment of a federal budget was delayed until april once enacted  the budget did not provide adequate funding for many land mobile radio requirements 
consequently  agencies had to scale down or defer fulfilling their requirements 
cost of products and gross margins cost of products as a percentage of sales for was compared with in product mix  manufacturing volume and pricing are the primary factors that impact product costs and the resulting gross margins 
for  our cost of products and gross margins reflected reduced sales and higher material and labor costs for the early production of new products 
these factors abated during the second half of the year 
production runs later in the year benefited from refinements in our manufacturing processes  yielding lower material costs and improved labor efficiencies 
also  sales increased in the second half of the year compared with the first half resulting in increased manufacturing volumes  and better utilization and absorption of our base of manufacturing support expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for  sg a expenses decreased approximately million to approximately million or of sales compared with approximately million or of sales for the prior year 
engineering and product development expenses for decreased approximately  compared with the prior year 
the decrease was the result of expense reductions that commenced in the second quarter and continued for the remainder of the year  as some product development initiatives were completed 
the expense reductions were partially offset by amortization of additional capitalized software that commenced during the fourth quarter when we released our new trunking digital radio and continued in marketing and selling expenses for decreased by approximately  compared with the prior year 
these decreases related primarily to expense and commission reductions implemented during the second quarter and maintained for the remainder of the year 
general and administrative expenses for decreased by approximately  compared with the prior year 
these expense reductions were primarily the result of reductions in headquarters and public company expenses  including non cash share based employee compensation expenses 

table of contents operating loss we reported an operating loss of  for  compared with an operating loss of  in the operating loss for was primarily due to sluggish sales and increases in cost of products during the first half of the year 
these factors were partially offset by operating expense reductions implemented during the second quarter and maintained for the remainder of the year 
interest expense  net for  net interest expense totaled  compared with  for the prior year 
the expense increase was due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we incur interest expense on outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and earn interest income on our cash balances 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december   compared with million outstanding as of year end the interest rate on our revolving credit facility as of december  was per annum 
income tax benefit expense we recorded an income tax benefit of  for compared with income tax expense of  for our income tax expense is largely non cash as a result of the deferred tax asset related primarily to federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had deferred tax assets of approximately million  which was materially unchanged from the previous year 
these assets are primarily composed of nols 
these nols totaled approximately million for federal and approximately million for state purposes as of december   with expirations starting in through during  we utilized approximately million of our nols 
in order to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets  we need to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize our nols prior to their expiration 
consistent with asc topic  income taxes  we evaluated the available evidence and the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our net deferred tax assets december   and from our evaluation we concluded that based on the weight of available evidence  we were more likely than not to not realize a portion of the benefit of our state deferred tax assets recorded at december  accordingly  we established a valuation allowance totaling approximately  for the portion of benefit of state deferred tax assets that more likely than not will not be realized 
changing prices changing prices for the years ended december   and did not have a material impact on our operations 
the extent of competitive pricing pressure in the future and its impact is uncertain 
liquidity and capital resources for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million compared with net cash used in operating activities totaling approximately  last year 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily related to net income  depreciation and amortization  deferred tax assets and accounts receivable 
these items were partially offset by increases in inventories 
for the year ended december   we realized net income of approximately million compared with a net loss totaling approximately  last year 
depreciation and amortization totaled approximately million for  which was materially unchanged from last year 
deferred tax assets for decreased by approximately  due to non cash tax expense on our pretax income 
during the same period last year deferred tax assets increased approximately  accounts receivable as of december  decreased by approximately million as a result of collections 
for the prior year accounts receivable increased by approximately  accounts payable for the year decreased approximately  due to payments to suppliers 
last year accounts payable decreased by approximately million primarily due to payments to suppliers 
accrued compensation as of december  increased by approximately  reflecting incentive compensation related to improved sales and operating results 
for the same period last year  accrued compensation increased approximately  net inventories increased during the year ended december  by approximately million in anticipation of sales growth 

table of contents cash used in investing activities for totaled approximately  compared with approximately  last year 
cash used in investing activities for was primarily to fund the purchase of engineering and manufacturing equipment and the development of software 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded through our existing cash balance and operating cash flow 
cash provided by financing activities for the totaled approximately  representing proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
for the same period last year cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million  which represented the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we have a secured revolving credit facility with silicon valley bank svb  which was most recently amended in december  with a maximum borrowing availability of million subject to the borrowing base and a maturity date of december  the loan and security agreement  as amended  governing this revolving credit facility contains customary borrowing terms and conditions  including the accuracy of representations and warranties  compliance with financial maintenance and restrictive covenants and the absence of events of default 
the terms of the loan and security agreement include the following financial maintenance covenants  required to be maintained at all times and tested on the last day of each month  of a ratio of quick assets to current liabilities minus deferred revenue all as defined in the loan and security agreement of at least and tangible net worth as defined in the loan and security agreement of at least million  increasing by a of quarterly net profits and b of net proceeds derived from issuances of equity and issuances of subordinated debt 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the prime rate  as in effect from time to time  plus basis points  provided if our adjusted quick ratio is greater than or equal to to  then the interest rate is the prime rate 
the maximum that we may borrow at any given time is based on among other things  eligible accounts receivable  inventory  and cash 
our obligations are secured by substantially all of our assets  principally accounts receivable and inventory 
we are prohibited from paying cash dividends on our common stock and making any distribution or payment or redeeming  retiring or purchasing any of our capital stock  provided that we are permitted to make permitted stock repurchases consisting of repurchases of our common stock when no default or event of default exists  ii our representations and warranties remain true in all material respects  the repurchase occurs not later than december   the aggregate purchase price for all permitted stock repurchases does not exceed  and at the time of the repurchase the adjusted quick ratio is at least to 
for a more detailed description of such borrowing terms and conditions  reference is made to note debt of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the loan and security agreement  as amended  as of december  and as of the date of this report on form k 
as of december  and the date of filing this report  we had no borrowings outstanding under the secured credit facility  and approximately million and million  respectively  was available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents our cash balance at december  was approximately million 
we believe these funds combined with anticipated cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our revolving credit facility are sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  although we do not anticipate needing additional capital in the near term  the current financial and economic conditions could limit our access to credit and impair our ability to raise capital  if needed  on acceptable terms or at all 
we also face other risks that could impact our business  liquidity and financial condition 
for a description of these risks  see item a 
risk factors set forth elsewhere in this report 
the following table sets forth the company s future contractual obligations for the next five years and in the aggregate as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases purchase obligations revolving credit facility total for a description of our revolving credit facility and our operating leases  reference is made to notes and to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements there have been no recent accounting pronouncements or changes in accounting pronouncements that impacted the years ended december   and  or which are expected to impact future periods  which were not previously disclosed in prior periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected for discussion our revenue recognition process and our more subjective accounting estimation processes 
these processes affect our reported revenues and current assets and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status 
the processes for determining the allowance for collection of trade receivables  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory  software development and income taxes  involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
revenue sales revenue is recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection is reasonably assured 
the earnings process is generally complete when the product is shipped by the company or delivered to the customer  depending upon whether the title to the goods  as well as the risks and benefits of ownership are transferred to the customer at point of shipment or point of delivery 
however  sales to the federal government are recognized when the products are delivered 
for extended warranties  sales revenue associated with the warranty is deferred at the time of sale and later recognized on a straight line basis over the extended warranty period 
we periodically review our revenue recognition procedures to assure that such procedures are in accordance with asc topic  revenue recognition 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december   as compared with  on gross trade receivables of approximately million as of december  this allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables as of december  because the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding as of december  cannot be known with certainty as of this report s date  we rely on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have typically been infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being less than of sales during past years 
accordingly  we have maintained a general allowance up to approximately of the gross trade receivables balance in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but turn out to have such an inability 
currently  our general allowance on trade receivables is approximately of gross receivables 
as revenues and total receivables increase  the allowance balance may also increase 
we also maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify those accounts that are more likely than not to have collection problems 
we may reserve a portion or all of the customer s balance 
excess and obsolete inventory the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory was approximately million at december  and the reserve for slow moving  excess  or obsolete inventory is used to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
because the amount of inventory that we will actually recoup through sales cannot be known with certainty at any particular time  we rely on past sales experience  future sales forecasts  and our strategic business plans 
generally  in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify inventory as having been used or unused during the past year and establish a reserve based upon several factors  including  but not limited to  business forecasts  inventory quantities and historic usage profile 
supplemental to the aforementioned analysis  specific inventory items are reviewed individually by management 
based on the review  considering business levels  future prospects  new products and technology changes  the valuation of specific inventory items may be adjusted to reflect an accurate valuation  in the business judgment of management 
management also performs a determination of net realizable value for all finished goods with a selling price below cost 
for all such items  the inventory is valued at not more than the selling price less cost  if any  to sell 
software development we account for the costs of software within its products in accordance with asc topic costs of software to be sold  leased or marketed  under which certain software costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the related products 
we determine technological feasibility to be established upon the internal release of a detailed program design as specified by topic upon the general release of the product to customers  development costs for that product are amortized over periods not exceeding five years  based on current and future revenue of the product 
net capitalized software costs totaled approximately million as of december   as compared with approximately million as of december  income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method specified by asc topic  income taxes  as modified by asc topic deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be realized 
the effect of changes in net deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change is recognized 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent that it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a tax asset is realizable  we consider among other things  estimates of future earnings based on information currently available  current and anticipated customers  contracts and new product introductions  as well as recent operating results and certain tax planning strategies 
if we fail to achieve the future results anticipated in the calculation and valuation of net deferred tax assets  we may be required to adjust the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the ordinary course of business for borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which bear interest at a variable rate 
the lender presently charges interest at the prime rate  as in effect from time to time 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
interest rate changes on variable debt impact the interest incurred and cash flows but do not impact the net market value of the debt instrument
