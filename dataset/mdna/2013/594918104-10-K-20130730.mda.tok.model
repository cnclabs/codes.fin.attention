item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of microsoft corporation 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our financial statements and the accompanying notes to financial statements 
overview microsoft is a technology leader focused on helping people and businesses throughout the world realize their full potential 
we create technology that transforms the way people work  play  and communicate across a wide range of computing devices 

table of contents part ii item we generate revenue by developing  licensing  and supporting a wide range of software products  by offering an array of services  including cloud based services to consumers and businesses  by designing and selling devices that integrate with our cloud based services  and by delivering relevant online advertising to a global audience 
our most significant expenses are related to compensating employees  designing  manufacturing  marketing  and selling our products and services  and income taxes 
industry trends our industry is dynamic and highly competitive  with frequent changes in both technologies and business models 
each industry shift is an opportunity to conceive new products  new technologies  or new ideas that can further transform the industry and our business 
at microsoft  we push the boundaries of what is possible through a broad range of research and development activities that seek to identify and address the changing demands of customers  industry trends  and competitive forces 
key opportunities and investments based on our assessment of key technology trends and our broad focus on long term research and development of new products and services  we see significant opportunities to generate future growth 
we invest research and development resources in new products and services in these areas 
the capabilities and accessibility of pcs  tablets  phones  televisions  and other devices powered by rich software platforms and applications continue to grow 
with this trend  we believe the full potential of software will be seen and felt in how people use these devices and the associated services at work and in their personal lives 
devices with end user services we work with an ecosystem of partners to deliver a broad spectrum of windows devices 
in some cases  we build our own devices  as we have chosen to do with xbox and surface 
in all our work with partners and on our own devices  we focus on delivering seamless services and experiences across devices 
as consumer services and hardware advance  we expect they will continue to better complement one another  connecting the devices people use daily to unique communications  productivity  and entertainment services from microsoft and our partners and developers around the world 
windows reflects this shift 
launched in october  windows was designed to unite the light  thin  and convenient aspects of a tablet with the power of a pc 
the windows operating system includes the windows store  which offers a large and growing number of applications from microsoft and partners for both business and consumer customers 
going forward  our strategy will focus on creating a family of devices and services for individuals and businesses that empower people around the globe at home  at work  and on the go  for the activities they value most 
this strategy will require investment in datacenters and other infrastructure to support our services  and will bring continued competition with apple  google  and other well established and emerging competitors 
we believe our history of powering devices such as windows pcs and xbox  as well as our experience delivering high value experiences through office and other applications  will position us for future success 
services for the enterprise today  businesses face important opportunities and challenges 
enterprises are asked to deploy technology that drives business strategy forward 
they decide what solutions will make employees more productive  collaborative  and satisfied  or connect with customers in new and compelling ways 
they work to unlock business insights from a world of data 
at the same time  they must manage and secure corporate information that employees access across a growing number of personal and corporate devices 

table of contents part ii item to address these opportunities  businesses look to our world class business applications like microsoft dynamics  office  exchange  sharepoint  lync  yammer  and our business intelligence solutions 
they rely on our technology to manage employee corporate identity and to protect their corporate data 
and  increasingly  businesses of all sizes are looking to microsoft to realize the benefits of the cloud 
helping businesses move to the cloud is one of our largest opportunities 
cloud based solutions provide customers with software  services  and content over the internet by way of shared computing resources located in centralized data centers 
the shift to the cloud is driven by three important economies of scale larger data centers can deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones  larger data centers can coordinate and aggregate diverse customer  geographic  and application demand patterns improving the utilization of computing  storage  and network resources  and multi tenancy lowers application maintenance labor costs for large public clouds 
because of the improved economics  the cloud offers unique levels of elasticity and agility that enable new solutions and applications 
for businesses of all sizes  the cloud creates the opportunity to focus on innovation while leaving non differentiating activities to reliable and cost effective providers 
unique to microsoft  we continue to design and deliver cloud solutions that allow our customers to use both the cloud and their on premise assets however best suits their own needs 
for example  a company can choose to deploy office or microsoft dynamics on premise  as a cloud service  or a combination of both 
with windows server  windows azure  and system center infrastructure  businesses can deploy applications in their own datacenter  a partner s datacenter  or in microsoft s datacenter with common security  management  and administration across all environments  with the flexibility and scale they desire 
these hybrid capabilities allow customers to fully harness the power of the cloud so they can achieve greater levels of efficiency and tap new areas of growth 
our future opportunity there are several distinct areas of technology that we are focused on driving forward 
our goal is to lead the industry in these areas over the long term  which we expect will translate to sustained growth well into the future 
we are investing significant resources in developing new form factors that have increasingly natural ways to use them  including touch  gesture  and speech 
applying machine learning to make technology more intuitive and able to act on our behalf  instead of at our command 
building and running cloud based services in ways that unleash new experiences and opportunities for businesses and individuals 
establishing our windows platform across the pc  tablet  phone  server  and cloud to drive a thriving ecosystem of developers  unify the cross device user experience  and increase agility when bringing new advances to market 
delivering new high value experiences with improvements in how people learn  work  play  and interact with one another 
we believe the breadth of our devices and services portfolio  our large  global partner and customer base  and the growing windows ecosystem position us to be a leader in these areas 
economic conditions  challenges  and risks the market for software  devices  and cloud based services is dynamic and highly competitive 
some of our traditional businesses such as the windows operating system are in a period of transition 
our competitors are developing new devices and deploy competing cloud based services for consumers and businesses 
the devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly  and influence how users access services in the cloud and in some cases the user s choice of which suite of cloud based services to use 
the windows ecosystem must continue to evolve and adapt  over an extended time  in pace with this changing environment 
to support our strategy of offering 
table of contents part ii item a family of devices and services designed to empower our customers for the activities they value most  we announced a functional realignment in july through this realignment our goal is to become more nimble  collaborative  communicative  motivated  and decisive 
even if we achieve these benefits  the investments we are making in devices and infrastructure to support our cloud based services will increase our operating costs and may decrease our operation margins 
we prioritize our investments among the highest long term growth opportunities 
these investments require significant resources and are multi year in nature 
the products and services we bring to market may be developed internally  as part of a partnership or alliance  or through acquisition 
our success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees 
we hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide 
microsoft competes for talented individuals worldwide by offering broad customer reach  scale in resources  and competitive compensation 
aggregate demand for our software  services  and hardware is correlated to global macroeconomic factors  which remain dynamic 
see a discussion of these factors and other risks under risk factors part i  item a of this form k 
seasonality our revenue historically has fluctuated quarterly and has generally been highest in the second quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers 
our entertainment and devices division is particularly seasonal as its products are aimed at the consumer market and are in highest demand during the holiday shopping season 
typically  the entertainment and devices division has generated approximately of its yearly revenue in our second fiscal quarter 
unearned revenue quarterly and annual revenue may be impacted by the deferral of revenue 
see the discussions below regarding revenue deferred on sales of windows with an option to upgrade to windows pro at a discounted price the windows upgrade offer and sales of the previous version of the microsoft office system with a guarantee to be upgraded to the new office at minimal or no cost the office upgrade offer  for the offer relating to the new office  and the office upgrade offer for the prior offer relating to office 
if our customers elect to license cloud based versions of our products and services rather than licensing transaction based products and services  the associated revenue will shift from being recognized at the time of the transaction to being recognized over the subscription period or upon consumption  as applicable 
results of operations summary in millions  except percentages and per share amounts percentage change versus percentage change versus revenue operating income diluted earnings per share fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenue increased  primarily due to higher revenue from server and tools as well as revenue from new products and services  including windows  surface  and the new office  offset in part by the impact on revenue of a decline in the x pc market

we supply windows  our primary windows division product  to customers through our us regional operating center  while we supply the microsoft office system  our primary mbd product  and our server and tools products to customers through our foreign regional operations centers 
in fiscal years and  our us income before income taxes was billion and billion  respectively  and comprised and  respectively  of our income before income taxes 
in fiscal years and  the foreign income before income taxes was billion and billion  respectively  and comprised and  respectively  of our income before income taxes 
the primary driver for the decrease in the us income before income tax in fiscal year was the goodwill impairment charge 
financial condition cash  cash equivalents  and investments cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion as of june   compared with billion as of june  equity and other investments were billion as of june   compared with billion as of june  our short term investments are primarily to facilitate liquidity and for capital preservation 
they consist predominantly of highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities  diversified among industries and individual issuers 
the investments are predominantly us dollar denominated securities  but also include foreign currency denominated securities in order to diversify risk 
our fixed income investments are exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
the credit risk and average maturity of our fixed income portfolio are managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain fixed income indices 
the settlement risk related to these investments is insignificant given that the short term investments held are primarily highly liquid investment grade fixed income securities 
while we own certain mortgage backed and asset backed fixed income securities  our portfolio as of june  does not contain material direct exposure to subprime mortgages or structured vehicles that derive their value from subprime collateral 
the majority of our mortgage backed securities are collateralized by prime residential mortgages and carry a principal and interest guarantee  primarily from federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation  and government national mortgage association 
we routinely monitor our financial exposure to both sovereign and non sovereign borrowers and counterparties 
our gross exposures to our customers and investments in portugal  italy  ireland  greece  and spain are individually and collectively not material 
of the cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments at june   approximately billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries and would be subject to material repatriation tax effects 
the amount of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments held by foreign subsidiaries subject to other restrictions on the free flow of funds primarily currency and other local regulatory was approximately million 
as of june   approximately of the cash equivalents and short term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were invested in us government and agency securities  approximately were invested in corporate notes and bonds of us companies  and were invested in us mortgage backed securities  all of which are denominated in us dollars 
securities lending we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
cash and or security interests are received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of 
table of contents part ii item the borrower 
cash received is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
our securities lending payable balance was million as of june  our average and maximum securities lending payable balances for the fiscal year were million and billion  respectively 
intra year variances in the amount of securities loaned are mainly due to fluctuations in the demand for the securities 
valuation in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair value of our financial instruments 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments  such as exchange traded mutual funds  domestic and international equities  and us government securities 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs other than the quoted prices that are observable either directly or indirectly 
this pricing methodology applies to our level investments such as corporate notes and bonds  foreign government bonds  mortgage backed securities  and us agency securities 
level investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 
a majority of our investments are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level or level investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs for their pricing without applying significant adjustments 
broker pricing is used mainly when a quoted price is not available  the investment is not priced by our pricing vendors  or when a broker price is more reflective of fair values in the market in which the investment trades 
our broker priced investments are generally classified as level investments because the broker prices these investments based on similar assets without applying significant adjustments 
in addition  all of our broker priced investments have a sufficient level of trading volume to demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments 
our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded 
these controls include model validation  review of key model inputs  analysis of period over period fluctuations  and independent recalculation of prices where appropriate 
cash flows fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flows from operations decreased billion during the current fiscal year to billion  due mainly to changes in working capital  including increases in inventory and other current assets 
cash used for financing decreased billion to billion  due mainly to a billion increase in proceeds from issuances of debt  net of repayments  offset in part by a billion increase in dividends paid and a million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash used in investing decreased million to billion  due mainly to an billion decrease in cash used for acquisitions of companies and purchases of intangible and other assets  offset in part by a billion increase in cash used for net investment purchases  maturities  and sales and a billion increase in cash used for additions to property and equipment 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year cash flows from operations increased billion during fiscal year to billion  due mainly to increased revenue and cash collections from customers 
cash used for financing increased billion to billion  due mainly to a billion net decrease in proceeds from issuances of debt and a billion increase in dividends paid  offset in part by a billion decrease in cash used for common stock repurchases 
cash used in investing increased billion to billion  due mainly to a billion increase in acquisitions of businesses and purchases of intangible assets and a billion decrease in cash from securities lending activities  partially offset by a billion decrease in cash used for net purchases  maturities  and sales of investments 

table of contents part ii item debt we issued debt to take advantage of favorable pricing and liquidity in the debt markets  reflecting our credit rating and the low interest rate environment 
the proceeds of these issuances were or will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include  among other things  funding for working capital  capital expenditures  repurchases of capital stock  acquisitions  and repayment of existing debt 
as of june   the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long term debt  including the current portion  were billion and billion  respectively 
this is compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of billion and billion  respectively  as of june  these estimated fair values are based on level inputs 
the components of our long term debt  including the current portion  and the associated interest rates were as follows as of june  due date face value stated interest rate effective interest rate in millions notes september  june  september  february  november  a may  b june  october  february  november  a may  b may  c june  october  february  november  a may  b total a in november  we issued billion of debt securities 
b in april  we issued billion of debt securities 
c in april  we issued million of debt securities 
interest on the notes is paid semi annually  except for the euro denominated debt securities on which interest is paid annually 
as of june   the aggregate unamortized discount for our long term debt  including the current portion  was million 
notes the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding 

table of contents part ii item convertible debt in june  we paid cash of billion for the principal amount of our zero coupon convertible unsecured debt and elected to deliver cash for the million excess obligation resulting from the conversion of the notes 
each  principal amount of notes was convertible into shares of microsoft common stock at a conversion price of per share 
as of june   the net carrying amount of the convertible debt and the unamortized discount were billion and million  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of the notes in  we entered into capped call transactions with certain option counterparties with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the notes 
upon conversion of the notes in june  we exercised the capped calls 
the bulk of the capped calls were physically settled by acquiring million shares of our own common stock for million 
the remaining capped calls were net cash settled for million 
credit facility in june  we established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of up to billion in commercial paper 
as of june   we have not issued any commercial paper under this program 
in june  we entered into a billion credit facility  which will serve as a back up for our commercial paper program 
as of june   we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit agreement  which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to interest expense  as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit facility expires on june  no amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its inception 
unearned revenue unearned revenue at june  comprised mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs 
unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings for multi year licensing arrangements paid for either at inception of the agreement or annually at the beginning of each coverage period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period 
unearned revenue at june  also included payments for post delivery support and consulting services to be performed in the future  xbox live subscriptions and prepaid points  oem minimum commitments  microsoft dynamics business solutions products  skype prepaid credits and subscriptions  and other offerings for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we provide the service or software  or otherwise meet the revenue recognition criteria 
the following table outlines the expected future recognition of unearned revenue as of june  in millions three months ending  september  december  march  june  thereafter total share repurchases on september   we announced that our board of directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing up to billion in share repurchases with an expiration date of september  as of june   approximately billion remained of the billion approved repurchase amount 
the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice 

table of contents part ii item during the periods reported  we repurchased with cash resources million shares for billion during fiscal year  million shares for billion during fiscal year  and million shares for billion during fiscal year dividends during fiscal years and  our board of directors declared the following dividends declaration date dividend per share record date total amount payment date in millions fiscal year september  november   december  november  february   march  march  may   june  june  august   september  fiscal year september  november   december  december  february   march  march  may   june  june  august   september  off balance sheet arrangements we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain other matters 
in evaluating estimated losses on these indemnifications  we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
these obligations did not have a material impact on our financial statements during the periods presented 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal year for our outstanding contractual obligations as of june  in millions thereafter total long term debt a principal payments interest payments construction commitments b operating leases c purchase commitments d other long term liabilities e total contractual obligations a see note debt of the notes to financial statements part ii  item of this form k 
b these amounts represent commitments for the construction of buildings  building improvements  and leasehold improvements 
c these amounts represent undiscounted future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable facilities leases 
d these amounts represent purchase commitments  including all open purchase orders and all contracts that are take or pay contracts that are not presented as construction commitments above 

table of contents part ii item e we have excluded long term tax contingencies  other tax liabilities  and deferred income taxes of billion and other long term contingent liabilities of million related to the antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits from the amounts presented  as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known and the timing of any payments is uncertain 
we have also excluded unearned revenue and non cash items 
other planned uses of capital we will continue to invest in sales  marketing  product support infrastructure  and existing and advanced areas of technology 
additions to property and equipment will continue  including new facilities  data centers  and computer systems for research and development  sales and marketing  support  and administrative staff 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in coming years in support of our cloud and devices strategy 
we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment 
we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
liquidity we earn a significant amount of our operating income outside the us  which is deemed to be permanently reinvested in foreign jurisdictions 
as a result  as discussed above under cash  cash equivalents  and investments  the majority of our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments are held by foreign subsidiaries 
we currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds 
we expect existing domestic cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our domestic operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities  such as regular quarterly dividends  debt repayment schedules  and material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect existing foreign cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash flows from operations to continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities  such as material capital expenditures  for at least the next months and thereafter for the foreseeable future 
should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations domestically  for example to fund significant discretionary activities  such as business acquisitions and share repurchases  we could elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates  increased interest expense  or dilution of our earnings 
we have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates 
recent accounting guidance recently adopted accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the new guidance provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
we adopted this new guidance beginning july  adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the new guidance eliminated the option to report other comprehensive income oci and its components in the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
instead  an entity is required to present either a continuous statement of net income and oci or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we adopted this new guidance beginning july  adoption of this new guidance resulted only in changes to presentation of our financial statements 

table of contents part ii item recent accounting guidance not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature of an entity s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross amounts subject to rights of set off  amounts offset in accordance with the accounting standards followed  and the related net exposure 
in january  the fasb clarified that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives  including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements  and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement  or similar agreements 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
in february  the fasb issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
this new guidance requires entities to present either on the face of the income statement or in the notes the effects on the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out of aoci 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  other than requiring additional disclosures  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
in march  the fasb issued guidance on a parent s accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity 
this new guidance requires that the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided 
the new guidance will be effective for us beginning july  we do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon adoption 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  goodwill  research and development costs  contingencies  income taxes  and inventories 
revenue recognition revenue recognition requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
a portion of revenue may be recorded as unearned due to undelivered elements 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify the vsoe for those elements  and the fair value of the respective elements could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software products software assurance and are accounted for as subscriptions  with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period 
software updates are evaluated on a case by case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade  which may require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered  or if it is determined that implied post contract customer support pcs is being provided  revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied pcs term 
if updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade  revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made available 
windows will enable new hardware  further the integration with other microsoft services and address customer issues with windows  and will be provided to windows customers when available at no additional charge 
we evaluated windows and determined that it did not meet the definition of an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this planned release 

table of contents part ii item windows revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the windows upgrade offer  which started june  the offer provided significantly discounted rights to purchase windows pro to qualifying end users that purchased windows pcs during the eligibility period 
microsoft was responsible for delivering windows pro to the end customer 
accordingly  revenue related to the allocated discount for undelivered windows was deferred until it was delivered or the redemption period expired 
microsoft office system revenue was subject to deferral as a result of the office upgrade offer  which started october  the office upgrade offer allowed customers who purchased qualifying microsoft office system or office for mac products to receive  at no cost  a one year subscription to office home premium or the equivalent version of microsoft office system upon general availability 
small business customers in applicable markets were also eligible for a three month trial of office small business premium 
accordingly  estimated revenue related to the undelivered microsoft office system and subscription services was deferred until the products and services were delivered or the redemption period expired 
impairment of investment securities we review investments quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  credit quality of debt instrument issuers  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and for equity securities  our intent and ability to hold  or plans to sell  the investment 
for fixed income securities  we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to other income expense and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
goodwill we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis may for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this analysis requires significant judgments  including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
the estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results  market conditions  and other factors 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
research and development costs costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all 
table of contents part ii item software costs are capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
generally  this occurs shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
legal and other contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial statements 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting literature also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  and income tax disclosures 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at average cost  subject to the lower of cost or market 
cost includes materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand  future purchase commitments with our suppliers  and the estimated utility of our inventory 
these reviews include analysis of demand forecasts  product life cycle status  product development plans  current sales levels  pricing strategy  and component cost trends 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue 
the determination of market value and the estimated volume of demand used in the lower of cost or market analysis require significant judgment 

table of contents part ii item statement of management s responsibility for financial statements management is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and related information that are presented in this report 
the consolidated financial statements  which include amounts based on management s estimates and judgments  have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks we are exposed to economic risk from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  credit risk  equity prices  and commodity prices 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but they may impact our financial statements 
foreign currency certain forecasted transactions  assets  and liabilities are exposed to foreign currency risk 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily and use hedges where practicable to offset the risks and maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
interest rate our fixed income portfolio is diversified across credit sectors and maturities  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
the credit risk and average maturity of the fixed income portfolio is managed to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain global and domestic fixed income indices 
in addition  we use to be announced forward purchase commitments of mortgage backed assets to gain exposure to agency and mortgage backed securities 
equity our equity portfolio consists of global  developed  and emerging market securities that are subject to market price risk 
we manage the securities relative to certain global and domestic indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
commodity we use broad based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and facilitate portfolio diversification 
our investment portfolio has exposure to a variety of commodities  including precious metals  energy  and grain 
we manage these exposures relative to global commodity indices and expect their economic risk and return to correlate with these indices 
value at risk we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in the fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the distribution of the potential changes in total market value of all holdings is computed based on the historical volatilities and correlations among foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  equity prices  and commodity prices  assuming normal market conditions 
the var is calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  and legal risk 

table of contents part ii item a the following table sets forth the one day var for substantially all of our positions as of june  and and for the year ended june  in millions june  june  year ended june  risk categories average high low foreign currency interest rate equity commodity total one day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june   and less at june   than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks
