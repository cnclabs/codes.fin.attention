overview we are a leading provider of automation  vacuum and instrumentation solutions for multiple markets and are a valued business partner to original equipment manufacturers oems and equipment users throughout the world 
we serve markets where equipment productivity and availability is a critical factor for our customers success  typically in demanding temperature and or pressure environments 
our largest served market is the semiconductor capital equipment industry  which represented approximately  and of our consolidated revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively 
these decreases are the result of a cyclical downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market  combined with our efforts to target certain non semiconductor revenue opportunities  including acquisitions and a divestiture 
the non semiconductor markets served by us include life sciences  industrial capital equipment and other adjacent technology markets 
the demand for semiconductors and semiconductor manufacturing equipment is cyclical  resulting in periodic expansions and contractions of this market 
demand for our products has been impacted by these cyclical industry conditions 
our revenue for fiscal year benefited from an upturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
revenue for fiscal year was impacted by our acquisitions and divestitures and weakness in demand from semiconductor capital equipment customers 
revenue for fiscal year was also impacted by weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment  particularly in the first half of our fiscal year 
we have observed indications of improved demand from the semiconductor capital equipment market and we believe our revenue will improve in fiscal as compared to fiscal we expect the semiconductor equipment market will continue to be a key end market for our products  however  we intend to acquire and develop technologies that will create opportunities outside of the semiconductor market 
we completed the following acquisitions and investments to expand our life sciences product offering rts life sciences rts  a united kingdom based provider of automation solutions to the life sciences markets  acquired on april  for million  net of cash on hand  nexus biosystems  inc nexus  a california based provider of automation solutions and consumables to the life sciences markets  acquired on july  for million  net of cash on hand  and matrical  inc matrical  a washington based provider of biological sample preparation  management and storage solutions to the life sciences markets  acquired on august  for million  net of cash on hand 
although we have entered into transactions to expand the non semiconductor portions of our business  we continue to make investments to maintain and grow our semiconductor product and service offerings 
on january   we acquired intangible assets from intevac  inc for million 
we acquired these assets for use in the development of a next generation of semiconductor automation tools 
we expensed essentially all of this asset purchase as an in process research and development cost in the three months ended march  on october   we acquired crossing automation inc crossing  a 
table of contents us based provider of automation solutions for the global semiconductor front end markets 
the purchase price was million  net of cash on hand 
the acquisition of crossing provides us with the opportunity to enhance our existing capabilities with respect to manufacturing of atmospheric and vacuum automation solutions within the semiconductor front end market 
on april   we entered into an agreement with affiliates of celestica inc celestica to sell the assets of our contract manufacturing segment the business 
the sale was completed on june  for a purchase price of million in cash 
in addition  brooks and celestica entered into certain commercial supply and license agreements at the closing of the sale 
pursuant to those agreements  brooks supplies celestica with certain products and has licensed to celestica certain intellectual property needed to run the business and celestica supplies certain products to brooks 
due to the significance of these ongoing commercial arrangements  the sale did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment 
therefore  historical financial results of the divested business are not segregated within our consolidated financial statements for the historical periods during which this business was part of us 
in december  we committed to a restructuring plan that would achieve cost synergies associated with our acquisition of crossing and further reduce costs and improve profitability in light of the continued near term macro economic environment 
we eliminated redundant positions across the company and have substantially completed our restructuring plan as of september  however  we continually review our cost structure and could take further cost saving actions in the future 
for a discussion of our restructuring actions  please refer to restructuring and other charges below 
we report financial results in four segments brooks product solutions  brooks global services  brooks life science systems and contract manufacturing 
this financial reporting structure was implemented effective as of the beginning of our fourth quarter of fiscal year in response to changes in our management structure as well as our acquisitions of rts and nexus in the second half of fiscal the brooks product solutions segment provides a variety of products critical to technology equipment productivity and availability 
those products include atmospheric and vacuum tool automation systems  atmospheric and vacuum robots and robotic modules and cryogenic vacuum pumping  thermal management and vacuum measurement solutions which are used to create  measure and control critical process vacuum applications 
the brooks global services segment provides an extensive range of support services including on and off site repair services  on and off site diagnostic support services  and installation services that enable our customers to maximize process tool uptime and productivity 
this segment also provides end user customers with spare parts support services that maximize tool productivity 
the brooks life science systems segment provides automated sample management systems for automated cold sample storage  equipment for sample preparation and handling  consumables  and parts and support services to a wide range of life science customers including pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  biobanks  national laboratories  research institutes and research universities 
the contract manufacturing segment provided services to build equipment front end modules  vacuum transport modules and other subassemblies which enabled our customers to effectively source high quality and high reliability process tools for semiconductor market applications 
we sold this business unit to celestica inc on june  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue  bad debts  inventories  derivative instruments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  pensions and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  including current and anticipated worldwide economic conditions both in general and specifically in relation to the semiconductor and life science industries  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
as discussed in the year over year comparisons below  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue product revenue is associated with the sale of hardware systems  components and spare parts as well as product license revenue 
service revenue is associated with service contracts  repairs  upgrades and field service 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers  if any  are recognized as revenue 
the related shipping and handling costs are recognized in cost of revenue 

table of contents revenue from product sales that do not include significant customization is recorded upon delivery and transfer of risk of loss to the customer provided there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and  if applicable  customer acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated 
customer acceptance provisions are included in certain arrangements to ensure that the product meets the published specification requirements 
customer acceptance provisions in our arrangements generally consist of final testing procedures that are carried out either in one of our facilities or at the customer location 
when an arrangement includes acceptance criteria to be carried out in one of our facilities  we recognize revenue when the acceptance criteria have been successfully demonstrated and delivery and transfer of risk of loss have occurred 
when significant on site customer acceptance provisions are present in the arrangement  revenue is recognized upon completion of customer acceptance testing 
revenue from product sales that does include significant customization  which primarily include life science automation systems  is recorded using the percentage of completion method whereby revenue is recorded as work progresses based on a percentage that incurred labor effort to date bears to total projected labor effort 
payments collected from customers in advance of recognizing the related revenue is recorded as deferred revenue 
these arrangements are reviewed on a regular basis to determine whether a probable future loss exists 
if such a loss is estimated by comparing total estimated contract revenue to the total estimated contract costs  a loss is accrued in the same period we determine that the loss is probable 
revenue associated with service agreements is generally recognized ratably over the term of the contract  with payments from customers being recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue from repair services or upgrades of customer owned equipment is recognized upon completion of the repair effort and upon the shipment of the repaired item back to the customer 
in instances where the repair or upgrade includes installation  revenue is recognized when the installation is completed 
a portion of the revenue arrangements for sales of life science automation systems are multiple element arrangements that can include product  service  as well as other elements 
for revenue arrangements with multiple elements  arrangement consideration is allocated to each element based upon their relative selling price using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  or third party evidence tpe or based upon the relative selling price using estimated selling prices if vsoe or tpe does not exist 
we rely primarily on relative selling prices when we do not have vsoe for a specific element 
we recognize revenue on each element of the arrangement in accordance with our policies for revenue recognition 
the fair value of any undelivered elements is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets as a result of our acquisitions  we have identified intangible assets other than goodwill and generated significant goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are valued based on estimates of future cash flows and amortized over their estimated useful life 
goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing as well as testing upon the occurrence of any event that indicates a potential impairment 
intangible assets other than goodwill and other long lived assets are subject to an impairment test if there is an indicator of impairment 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of our fiscal year end  or september th 
the testing of goodwill for impairment is to be performed at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
a reporting unit is either the operating segment level or one level below  which is referred to as a component 
the level at which the impairment test is performed requires an assessment as to whether the operations below the operating segment constitute a self sustaining business  in which case testing is generally required to be performed at this level 
we currently have five reporting units that have goodwill  including three components that are part of our brooks product solutions operating segment and sole reporting units that are our brooks global services and brooks life science systems operating segments 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its respective carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be completed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  the excess of the fair value over amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an income approach  specifically the discounted cash flow method dcf method 
the dcf method includes future cash flow projections  which are discounted to present value  and an estimate of terminal values  which are also discounted to present value 
terminal values represent the present value an investor would pay today for the rights to the cash flows of the business for the years subsequent to the discrete cash flow projection period 
we consider the dcf method to be the most appropriate valuation indicator as the dcf analyses are based 
table of contents on management s long term financial projections 
given the dynamic nature of the cyclical semiconductor equipment market  management projections as of the valuation date are considered more objective since other market metrics for peer companies fluctuate over the cycle 
however  we also use market based valuation techniques to test the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values determined by the dcf method 
in addition  we compare the aggregate fair value of our reporting units plus our net corporate assets to our overall market capitalization 
for our annual goodwill impairment test as of september   we determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at least and that no impairment existed 
our tests of goodwill as of september  and indicated that we did not have any impairment to goodwill 
the fair values of the reporting units in the brooks product solutions and brooks global services segments exceeded their carrying values by amounts ranging from to at september  the goodwill allocated to the brooks life science systems reporting unit at september  was million 
the fair value of the brooks life science systems reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by at september  the observable inputs used in our dcf for analysis for the brooks life science systems reporting unit include a discount rate of 
in addition  we determined the terminal value using the gordon growth method and a terminal growth rate of 
the gordon growth method assumes that the reporting unit will grow and generate free cash flow at a constant rate 
we believe that the gordon growth method is the most appropriate method for determining the terminal value because the terminal value was calculated at the point in which we have assumed that the brooks life science systems reporting unit has reached a stable growth rate 
in fiscal  we experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit for the products in the brooks life science systems reporting unit 
the cash flow assumptions in our dcf method analysis for the brooks life science systems reporting unit project growth in our current automated sample management systems and the development of new automated sample management systems that would allow us to address a broader automated sample management market than we can address with our current products 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  our actual results could differ from our projections 
to the extent that the operating results of the brooks life science systems reporting unit do not improve as expected and new life science products being designed to expand the markets we serve are not introduced in a timely manner or accepted by the market  we may be required to write down all or a portion of the goodwill and other long lived assets associated with this reporting unit  which would adversely impact our earnings 
we are required to test long lived assets  other than goodwill  when indicators of impairment are present 
for purposes of this test  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
when we determine that indicators of potential impairment exist  the next step of the impairment test requires that the potentially impaired long lived asset group is tested for recoverability 
the test for recoverability compares the undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying values of the long lived asset group exceed the future cash flows  the assets are potentially impaired 
the next step in the impairment process is to determine the fair value of the individual net assets within the long lived asset group 
if the aggregate fair values of the individual net assets of the group are less than the carrying values  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the aggregate carrying value of the group over the aggregate fair value 
the loss is allocated to each asset within the group based on their relative carrying values  with no asset reduced below its fair value 
we determined that impairment indicators were present for long lived assets related to the celigo product line as of september  indicators of impairment for this asset group included declining sales in the trailing twelve months and negative cash flows from the asset group 
we tested the recoverability of the asset group by comparing the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows directly attributable to the assets to their carrying values  which resulted in the conclusion that the carrying amounts of the assets were not recoverable 
the fair value of the long lived assets related to the celigo products was based primarily on market based valuation techniques reflecting the view of a market participant using the assets in the group to their best possible use 
we determined that the carrying value of the asset group exceeded the fair value of the asset group by approximately million and we recorded this amount as an impairment charge in the fourth quarter of except as described above  we have not tested any other long lived assets  other than goodwill  since because no events have occurred that would require an impairment assessment 
accounts receivable we record trade accounts receivable at the invoiced amount 
trade accounts receivables do not bear interest 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
if the financial results of our customers deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
we do not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to our customers 

table of contents warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and may result in additional benefits or charges to operations 
inventory we provide reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we fully reserve for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete 
we perform periodic reviews of all inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand  based upon sales and marketing inputs through our planning systems 
if estimates of demand diminish further or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider recent historical income  estimated future taxable income  carry forward periods of tax attributes  the volatility of the semiconductor industry and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
we maintain a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the us and in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance in future periods 
if future operating results of the us or these foreign jurisdictions deviate from long term expectations  it is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the valuation allowance in the future 
a change in the valuation allowance  in whole or in part  would result in a non cash income tax expense or benefit during the period of change 
pension plans we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in switzerland and taiwan 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
should any of our assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
derivative financial instruments we record all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities at their fair value  which is determined by estimating future cash flows of the instrument 
subsequent changes in a derivative fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness are immediately recognized as income or expense 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for all employee stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on the number of shares granted and the excess of the quoted price of our common stock over the exercise price of the restricted stock on the date of grant  if any  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
in addition  for stock based awards where vesting is dependent upon achieving certain operating performance goals  we estimate the likelihood of achieving the performance goals 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ from our current estimates 

table of contents year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenue we reported revenue of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a decrease of 
this decrease was due to reduced demand for our products  primarily due to weakness in demand for semiconductor capital equipment which led to a reduction of million in revenue from our brooks product solutions segment and a million reduction in revenue from our brooks global services segment 
these decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of crossing which added million of revenue to our brooks product solutions segment and million of revenue to our brooks global services segment for fiscal year our brooks life science systems segment had lower sales of million for fiscal year as compared to the previous year due to lower demand 
our brooks product solutions segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
these decreases were mostly attributable to lower volumes of shipments to semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor adjacent customers  which decreased by million for fiscal year  as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was partially offset by million of product revenue for fiscal year  contributed by our acquisition of crossing 
our brooks global services segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
excluding the acquisition of crossing  revenue for this segment declined million for fiscal year as compared to the prior year period primarily due to weakness in demand 
total service revenue for this segment was million for fiscal year  including revenue contributed by the acquisition of crossing 
for the prior year period  service contract and repair revenue was million 
total spare parts revenue was million for fiscal year  including revenue contributed by the acquisition of crossing 
for the prior year period  spare parts revenue was million 
our brooks life science systems segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the same prior year period 
these decreases were the result of delays in customer decisions to purchase automated sample management systems during the first half of fiscal year revenue outside the united states was million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we expect that revenue outside the united states will continue to account for a significant portion of total revenue 
gross margin gross margin percentage decreased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
gross margin in fiscal includes million of charges related to the acquisition of crossing  related primarily to the sale of acquired inventory to which a step up in value was applied in our purchase accounting  which reduced gross margin by percentage points 
gross margin in fiscal also includes million of impairment charges and inventory reserves related to the celigo product line which reduced gross margin by percentage points 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by lower production which resulted in reduced absorption of our fixed costs 
however  the decrease in absorption was offset by lower charges for excess and obsolete inventories  warranty costs and other manufacturing costs which increased gross margin by approximately percentage points in fiscal year our gross margin percentage for our brooks products services segment decreased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to reduced demand for our products  which resulted in reduced absorption of our fixed costs 
in addition  gross margin for the brooks products services segment includes million related primarily to the sale of acquired inventory to which a step up in value was applied in our purchase accounting  which reduced gross margin by percentage points 
the decreases in gross margin were partially offset by lower charges for excess and obsolete inventories and warranty costs which increased gross margin by percentage points in fiscal year our gross margin percentage for our brooks global services segment increased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the increase is due to lower charges for excess and obsolete inventories which increased gross margin by percentage points in fiscal year and higher absorption of fixed costs resulting from an increase in revenue 
the increase was partially offset by million of charges related to the acquisition of crossing  related primarily to the sale of acquired inventory to which a step up in value was applied in our purchase accounting  which reduced gross margin by percentage points 
in addition  amortization expense associated with crossing reduced gross margin by percentage points in fiscal year our gross margin percentage for our brooks life science systems segment decreased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to million of impairment charges and inventory reserves related to the celigo product line 
the charges reduced gross profit margin by percentage points for fiscal year the remaining decrease relates to lower production and as a result  reduced absorption of our fixed costs 

table of contents research and development research and development  or r d  expenses for fiscal year were million  an increase of million  compared to million in the previous year 
lower labor and material costs resulting from restructuring actions and other cost saving initiatives were more than offset by our crossing acquisition  which increased r d expenses by million and were not included in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses were million for fiscal year  a decrease of million compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is the result of million of lower consulting costs and other professional service fees which decreased primarily because a project focused on improving operating efficiencies was completed in the prior year 
we also reduced labor costs by million through restructuring actions taken over the last twelve months and incurred million less stock based compensation expense as a result of performance based vesting criteria that we no longer expect to achieve 
lower sg a costs for fiscal were partially offset by million of sg a expenses for crossing  which were not included in the prior year 
in addition  in the second quarter of fiscal  we received million of insurance proceeds as reimbursement of previously incurred litigation related costs 
restructuring and other charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal these charges relate primarily to workforce reductions implemented to consolidate the operations of crossing and the company  to transition manufacturing of the polycold product line certain of our cryopump and cryochiller products to a third party contract manufacturer and other programs designed to improve our cost structure 
restructuring charges also included facility related costs incurred in connection with the consolidation of crossing facilities with our facilities 
restructuring costs recorded in fiscal consist of million of severance costs and million of facility related costs 
severance costs relate to a series of workforce reductions implemented to improve our cost structure by eliminating approximately positions 
total severance charges related to the outsourcing of the polycold manufacturing operation are expected to be million  including severance and retention bonuses 
this charge is being amortized over the period from notification of the closing to the actual service end date 
in the fourth quarter of  we extended the service end date from september to september as a result of changes in the transition plan with the third party contract manufacturer 
we expensed million of the total charge as of september   and will expense the balance ratably through fiscal unpaid severance charges of million as of september  are expected to be paid during fiscal year and the remaining million is expected to be paid during fiscal year we recorded a restructuring charge of million for fiscal year these charges are related primarily to a series of workforce reductions implemented to improve the company s cost structure by eliminating employees 
pension settlement during fiscal year  we advised participants of our frozen us defined benefit pension plan that we intended to settle this pension obligation 
this settlement occurred in the quarter ended september  and resulted in accelerated cash payments of approximately million to fully satisfy the pension liability  and resulted in an accelerated amortization of approximately million of prior pension losses that were previously reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
in process research and development during the three months ended march   we acquired primarily intellectual property from intevac  inc for million 
management evaluated this asset purchase to determine if this acquisition would be considered an acquisition of a business 
since only a limited amount of assets were acquired  management concluded that the inputs and processes required to meet the definition of a business were not acquired in this transaction  therefore  this transaction was treated as the purchase of an asset group 
this asset group includes primarily intellectual property that is used in the development of a next generation of semiconductor automation tools 
we expensed essentially all of this asset purchase as an in process research and development cost in the three months ended march  interest income interest income was million and million  respectively  for fiscal year and the reduction is due to lower cash balances available for investing due to the cash acquisitions of crossing in october and matrical in august 
table of contents other income  net other income  net of million for fiscal year consists primarily of a million gain on the sale of certain underutilized buildings in chelmsford  ma and oberdiessbach  switzerland and million of joint venture management fee income which was partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
other income  net of million for fiscal year consists primarily of million of joint venture management fee income partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million 
income tax provision benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit consists of deferred tax benefits in the us generated by pre tax losses and tax credits of million 
we recorded the benefit in the us because there is no valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated in the current year 
despite the current year loss in the us we are reporting taxable income due to the reversal of book to taxable income differences 
as a result  we have not changed any estimates with regard to long term utilization of our net operating losses and credits 
this benefit is partially offset by foreign taxes on profits of our foreign subsidiaries 
additionally  we recorded million of tax benefits for the reversal of tax reserves resulting from the expiration of statutes of limitations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
the us tax benefit includes million of us tax credits from fiscal year that were recognized in fiscal year these credits were reinstated under the american taxpayer relief act of that was signed into law on january  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for fiscal year this benefit includes a million deferred income tax benefit  primarily resulting from a significant reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we considered the weight of both positive and negative evidence as of september  and concluded that a substantial portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the tax benefit for fiscal year was partially offset by us state income taxes and foreign taxes 
equity in earnings of joint ventures income associated with our interest in ulvac cryogenics  inc  a joint venture with ulvac corporation of japan  was million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loss associated with our interest in yaskawa brooks automation  inc  a joint venture with yaskawa electric corporation of japan was million for fiscal year as compared to a gain of million for fiscal year year ended september   compared to year ended september  revenue we reported revenue of million for fiscal year  compared to million in the previous year  a decrease 
the total decrease in revenue of million was the result of the sale of our contract manufacturing segment  which had revenue of million in the prior year  decreased demand for our brooks product solutions products which resulted in million of decreased revenue and reduced demand for products and services from our brooks global services segment which resulted in million of lower revenue 
these decreases were partially offset by million of increased revenue from our brooks life science systems segment due to the acquisitions of rts and nexus in the last half of fiscal our brooks product solutions segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a decrease of from million in the prior year 
these decreases were attributable to lower volumes of shipments to most of the end markets served by this segment due to a decline in demand for semiconductor capital equipment 
our brooks global services segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a decrease from million in the prior year 
the decrease included a million decrease in product revenue  which was comprised mostly of spare part sales to end users 
this decrease  which was primarily attributable to decreased demand from our semiconductor customers  was partially offset by a million increase in revenue from services 
our brooks life science systems segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year  a increase from million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily the result of the timing of our acquisitions 
we acquired rts on april   nexus on july  and the celigo product line on december  revenue for this segment for fiscal year included million of product revenue  which included sales of automated systems and consumables 
the balance of the fiscal year revenue  or million  was comprised of service revenue to support deployed automation systems 
our contract manufacturing segment reported revenue of million for fiscal year this segment was sold on june  
table of contents revenue from the brooks product solutions segment for the fiscal year included intercompany sales of million from this segment to the contract manufacturing segment 
this intercompany revenue was eliminated from the revenue of contract manufacturing 
revenue for the contract manufacturing segment for the fiscal year excluded intercompany sales of million from this segment to the brooks product solutions segment 
revenue outside the united states was million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  for fiscal years and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin percentage increased to for fiscal year  compared to for the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to a more favorable product mix with the addition of our higher margin brooks life science systems segment and because we had sold our lower margin contract manufacturing segment 
this increase in gross margin percentage was partially offset by weaker margins in our brooks product solutions and brooks global services segments 
gross margin percentage of our brooks product solutions segment decreased to for fiscal year as compared to in the prior year 
the decrease was due in part to a less favorable product mix  which decreased gross margin by percentage points  plus increased charges for excess and obsolete inventory which reduced gross margin by percentage points 
the balance of the reduction in gross margin was mostly attributable to reduced production and lower absorption of our fixed costs 
the reduced cost absorption was the result of weakening demand for semiconductor capital equipment

if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressure or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an amendment to the accounting guidance for presentation of comprehensive income 
under the amended guidance  a company may present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
on october  we adopted this guidance and elected to present two separate but consecutive statements 
in february  the fasb issued guidance to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income aoci by component 
in addition  an entity is required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of aoci by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts 
on january  we adopted this standard  which had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure our cash and cash equivalents consist principally of money market securities which are short term in nature

a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual change of approximately million in interest income earned 
currency rate exposure we have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros  british pounds and a variety of asian currencies 
sales in currencies other than the us dollar were of our total sales for the year ended september  these foreign sales were made primarily by our foreign subsidiaries  which have cost structures that substantially align with the currency of sale 
in the normal course of our business  we have short term advances between our legal entities that are subject to foreign currency exposure 
these short term advances were approximately million at september   and relate to the euro  british pound and a variety of asian currencies 
we mitigate the impact of potential currency translation losses on these short term intercompany advances by the timely settlement of each transaction  generally within days 
we also utilize forward contracts to hedge our exposures 
we incurred a foreign currency loss of million for the year ended september   which relates to the currency fluctuation on these advances between the time the transaction occurs and the ultimate settlement of the transaction 
a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates at september  would result in a million change in our net income
