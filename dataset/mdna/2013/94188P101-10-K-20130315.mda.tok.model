item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our profitability is highly dependent on our net interest income  mortgage banking income and provision for loan losses 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets which are loans receivable  investment securities and cash and cash equivalents and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings 
the company banking subsidiary  waterstone bank ssb waterstone bank or bank is primarily a mortgage lender with loans secured by real estate comprising of total loans receivable on december  further  of loans receivable are residential mortgage loans with over four family loans comprising of all loans on december  waterstone bank funds loan production primarily with retail deposits and federal home loan bank advances 
the bank mortgage banking subsidiary  waterstone mortgage corporation  utilizes a line of credit provided by the bank as a primary source of funding loans held for sale 
in addition  waterstone mortgage corporation utilizes short term repurchase agreements with other banks as needed 
on december   deposits comprised of total liabilities 
time deposits  also known as certificates of deposit  accounted for of total deposits at december  federal home loan bank advances outstanding on december  totaled million  or of total liabilities 
during the current prolonged period of low interest rates and economic weakness  we have determined that an investment philosophy emphasizing short term liquid investments including cash and cash equivalents is prudent and positions the company to take advantage of the investment  lending and interest rate risk management opportunities that will exist as the local and national economies recover from the recession 
our high level of time deposits  relative to total deposits  will result in an increase in our cost of funds when market interest rates begin to increase 
during the year ended december   our results of operations were positively impacted by a significant increase in income from our mortgage banking segment and from a decrease in our provision for loans losses which resulted from an improvement in our asset quality 
a significant increase in both sales volumes and margins earned on the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market yielded a million increase in pre tax earnings from our mortgage banking segment during the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
despite pre tax income of million for the year ended december   we recognized a net income tax benefit of million 
the million benefit was primarily the result of the december  full reversal of million of remaining net deferred tax asset valuation allowances originally established in our provision for loan losses decreased million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in provision for loan losses reflects a stabilization in both the quality of our loan portfolio and the overall local real estate market 
the company has experienced a stabilization or improvement in a number of key loan related loan quality metrics compared to december   including impaired loans  loans contractually past due and non accrual loans 
in addition  the turnover of loans in each of the three aforementioned metrics has slowed during the year ended december  compared to the prior year  which has resulted in fewer loans requiring a specific collateral analysis to determine a potential collateral shortfall and subsequent loan loss reserve 
furthermore  as a result of stabilization in the local real estate market  those loans that have required a specific collateral review to assess the level of impairment have experienced less significant collateral shortfalls when compared to the prior year 
additional information regarding loan quality and its impact on our financial condition and results of operations can be found in the asset quality discussion 
offsetting the positive impact of the increase in income from mortgage banking operations and a reduction of the provision for loan losses  net interest income decreased million to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income resulted from a basis point drop in our net interest margin 
the yield on earning assets declined by times the decline in the cost of funds for the year ended december  compared to year ended december critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that involve significant judgments and assumptions by management and that have  or could have  a material impact on our income or the carrying value of our assets 
allowance for loan losses 
waterstone bank establishes valuation allowances on loans deemed to be impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that waterstone bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
a valuation allowance is established for an amount equal to the impairment when the carrying amount of the loan exceeds the present value of the expected future cash flows  discounted at the loan original effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral specific component 
the company recognizes the change in present value of expected future cash flows on impaired loans attributable to the passage of time as bad debt expense 
on an ongoing basis  at least quarterly for financial reporting purposes  the fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans and real estate owned is determined or reaffirmed by the following procedures obtaining updated real estate appraisals or performing updated discounted cash flow analysis  confirming that the physical condition of the real estate has not significantly changed since the last valuation date  comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated sales values experienced on similar real estate owned  comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated values seen on more current appraisals of similar properties  and comparison of the estimated current book value to that of updated listed sales prices on our real estate owned and that of similar properties not owned by the company 
waterstone bank also establishes valuation allowances based on an evaluation of the various risk components that are inherent in the credit portfolio general component 
the risk components that are evaluated include past loan loss experience  the level of non performing and classified assets  current economic conditions  volume  growth  and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  regulatory guidance  and other relevant factors 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and recoveries of previously charged off loans and reduced by charge offs 
charge offs approximate the amount by which the outstanding principal balance exceeds the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral 
the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed and approved quarterly by the waterstone bank board of directors 
the allowance reflects management best estimate of the amount needed to provide for the probable loss on impaired loans and other inherent losses in the loan portfolio  and is based on a risk model developed and implemented by management and approved by the waterstone bank board of directors 
actual results could differ from this estimate  and future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on unforeseen changes in loan quality and economic conditions 
more specifically  if our future charge off experience increases substantially from our past experience  or if the value of underlying loan collateral  in our case real estate  declines in value by a substantial amount  or if unemployment in our primary market area increases significantly  our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate and we will incur higher provisions for loan losses and lower net income in the future 
in addition  state and federal regulators periodically review the waterstone bank allowance for loan losses 
such regulators have the authority to require waterstone bank to recognize additions to the allowance at the time of their examination 
income taxes 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns 
the provision for income taxes is based upon income in the consolidated financial statements  rather than amounts reported on the income tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as for net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence may include cumulative losses in a current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december   the company determined a valuation allowance originally established in continued to be necessary  largely based on the negative evidence represented by a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused by the significant loan loss provisions recorded during those three years 
however  the valuation allowance was fully reversed at december  as a result of pretax income in each of the four quarters of and for the year  the payment of federal income taxes potentially available for subsequent carry back in future periods and improvement in the bank asset quality metrics as well as in general economic conditions 
positions taken in the company tax returns are subject to challenge by the taxing authorities upon examination 
the benefit of uncertain tax positions are initially recognized in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions are both initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authority  assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
interest and penalties on income tax uncertainties are classified within income tax expense in the income statement 
fair value measurements 
the company determines the fair value of its assets and liabilities in accordance with asc asc establishes a standard framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under gaap 
a number of valuation techniques are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in the company financial statements 
the valuation techniques include quoted market prices for investment securities  appraisals of real estate from independent licensed appraisers and other valuation techniques 
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities where limited or no observable market data exists are based primarily upon estimates  and are often calculated based on the economic and competitive environment  the characteristics of the asset or liability and other factors 
therefore  the valuation results cannot be determined with precision and may not be realized in an actual sale or immediate settlement of the asset or liability 
additionally  there are inherent weaknesses in any calculation technique  and changes in the underlying assumptions used  including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows  could significantly affect the results of current or future values 
significant changes in the aggregate fair value of assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value or for impairment are recognized in the income statement under the framework established by gaap 
comparison of financial condition at december  and at december total assets 
total assets decreased by million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total assets reflects decreases in loans receivable of million and real estate owned of million  partially offset by an increase in loans held for sale of million 
we used funds received from the repayment of loans held in portfolio  from the sale of real estate owned plus excess cash  to fund a reduction in deposits of million  as discussed below 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the overall level of cash and cash equivalents continues to reflect our plan to maintain higher than customary liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on securities and other investments 
securities available for sale 
securities available for sale decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease reflects a million decrease in government sponsored enterprise bonds and a million decrease in collateralized mortgage obligations  partially offset by an million increase in mortgage backed securities 
during the year ended december   the proceeds from maturities and calls of government sponsored enterprise securities and from the sale of collateralized mortgage obligations and municipal securities were primarily reinvested in mortgage related securities  as we believe such securities provided us with a better risk versus reward trade off during much of the year 
during the year ended december   we sold million in short term municipal securities at a gain of  as of december   we held two municipal securities with a total fair value of  and amortized cost of  that were determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
during the year ended december    was recognized as additional other than temporary impairment with respect to these municipal securities and was charged against earnings 
during the year ended december   we sold two private label collateralized mortgage obligations for a combined gain of  at the time of sale  these securities had a combined amortized cost of million 
each of these two securities had been previously determined to be other other than temporarily impaired in a prior period 
during the year ended december   our analysis resulted in an additional  in credit losses that were charged to earnings 
life to date other than temporary impairment losses recognized on these two securities totaled million 
loans receivable 
loans receivable held for investment decreased million  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the decrease in total loans receivable was primarily attributable to a million decrease in one to four family loans and a million decrease in over four family loans 
the decrease in one to four family loans reflects a decline in loan demand for variable rate real estate mortgage loans as borrowers continue to prefer long term fixed rate products that we do not generally retain in our portfolio 
during the year ended december   million in loans were transferred to real estate owned and million were charged off  net of recoveries 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the million decrease in the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december  reflects a stabilization in both the quality of the loan portfolio as well as the overall local real estate market 
we have experienced a stabilization or improvement in a number of key loan quality metrics compared to december   including impaired loans  substandard loans  loans contractually past due and non accrual loans 
in addition  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses reflects a decrease in the balance of loans outstanding 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses to total loans receivable was and was equal to of non performing loans  compared to and  respectively  at december  the overall million decrease in the allowance for loan losses during the year ended december  was primarily the result of decreases in the allowance for loan losses related to construction and land and over four family categories 
the decrease in allowance for loan losses related to these categories resulted from both the charge off of specific reserves as well as a decrease in the overall balance of loans outstanding 
the decrease in allowance for loan losses related to these two loan categories were partially offset by an increase in allowance for loan losses related to the one to four family and commercial real estate categories 
increases in the allowance for loan losses related to the one to four family and commercial real estate categories were the result of a decrease in collateral values related to loans previously classified as impaired  as well as an increase in the overall level of commercial real estate identified as impaired 
while the local real estate market has stabilized during the current fiscal year  the risk of loss on loans secured by residential real estate remains at an elevated level 
that portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to mortgage loans secured by residential real estate comprised of the total allowance for loan losses at december  and december  real estate owned 
total real estate owned decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  during the year ended december   million was transferred from loans to real estate owned upon completion of foreclosure proceedings 
declines in property values evidenced by updated appraisals  responses to list prices on properties held for sale and or deterioration in the condition of properties resulted in write downs totaling million during the year ended december  during the same period  sales of real estate owned totaled million 
prepaid expenses and other assets 
prepaid expenses and other assets increased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase is primarily due to a million increase in deferred tax assets  which resulted from the reversal of million in deferred income tax valuation allowances 
in addition  the mortgage servicing rights intangible asset related to loans sold on a servicing retained basis increased by million during the year ended december  deposits 
total deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from billion at december  the reduction in deposits reflects management decision to accept a certain level of deposit run off during a period of diminished loan demand 
total time deposits decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in time deposits was partially offset by an increase in money market and demand deposits 
total money market and savings deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  total demand deposits increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  borrowings 
total borrowings increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in borrowings relates entirely to an increase in the use of short term repurchase agreements to finance loans held for sale 
the outstanding balance of these short term repurchase agreements increased by million  to million at december   from million at december  other liabilities 
other liabilities increased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted primarily from an increase in accrued compensation and accrued expenses due to third parties related to our mortgage banking operations 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase in shareholders equity was primarily due to a million increase in retained earnings reflecting net income for the year ended december  in addition to the increase in retained earnings  shareholders equity was positively impacted by an  increase in accumulated other comprehensive income and an  decrease in unearned esop shares

segment review 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we have two reportable segments community banking and mortgage banking 
community banking consists of lending and deposit generation as well as other banking related products and services to consumers and businesses and the support to deliver  fund  and manage such banking services 
our mortgage banking segment provides residential mortgage products for the purpose of sale on the secondary market 
as such  it is a transaction based business 
transaction volume can vary significantly from period to period based upon changes in market interest rates and other economic and regulatory factors 
mortgage banking segment assets which consist predominantly of loans held for sale increased million  or  to million as of december  compared to million as of december  mortgage banking segment revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the million increase in mortgage banking revenues was attributable to both an increase in loan origination volume  as well as increased margins 
loans originated for sale in the secondary market totaled billion during the year ended december   representing a million  or  increase in originations from the year ended december   which totaled billion 
in addition to the increase in revenues resulting from the increase in origination volume  mortgage banking revenues increased due to an increase in average sales margin 
the increase in average sales margin was driven by an increase in pricing on products in all geographic markets 
the major components of mortgage banking revenues include fees and premiums associated with the sale of residential loans held for sale  which are discussed in noninterest income 
the major expenses for the mortgage banking segment are compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits  as well as occupancy  office furniture and equipment and other expenses  which are covered generally in the consolidated discussion in noninterest expense 
total interest income 
total interest income decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease in the average yield on interest earnings assets and a decrease in the average balance of interest earnings assets 
the average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the average balance of interest earning assets decreased million to billion for the year ended december  from billion for the year ended december interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans also reflects a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  interest income from mortgage related securities decreased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage related securities to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in average yield resulted from a general turnover of the investment securities portfolio in the current  historically low  interest rate environment 
the decrease in average yield was partially offset by a million  or  increase in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income from other interest earning assets comprised of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income decreased due to a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income from other earning assets also reflects an basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the debt security portfolio decreased as a result of million in maturities and million in sales 
a substantial portion of the proceeds from maturities and sales of debt securities were reinvested in mortgage related securities 
total interest expense 
total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was the result of both a decrease in the average cost of funds as well as a decrease in the average balance of interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
the average cost of funds decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense was also due to a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the cost of average deposits to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of deposits reflects the current low market interest rate environment due to the federal reserve board low short term interest rate policy 
these rates are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposits 
the decrease in the cost of deposits also reflects a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost time deposits to lower cost demand  money market and savings accounts 
the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was compounded by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to million during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in average interest bearing deposits was exclusively the result of a decrease in time deposits  which carry a higher cost than demand  money market or savings accounts 
the decrease in time deposits was consistent with our liquidity needs and funding obligations 
interest expense on borrowings increased  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million  or  increase in average borrowings outstanding to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increased use of borrowings as a funding source during the year ended december  reflects an increased use of short term repurchase agreements by our mortgage banking segment to fund loan originations to be sold in the secondary market 
the average cost of borrowings decreased basis points to during the year ended december  compared to during the year ended december  net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a basis point decrease in our interest rate spread to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the basis point decrease in the interest rate spread resulted from a basis point decrease in the average yield on interest earning assets  which was only partially offset by a basis point decrease in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  the decrease in the provision for loan losses resulted from a decrease in loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience when compared to the same period of the prior year 
while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remains at historical high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which  when applied to the portfolio in general  require higher loan loss provisions 
the provision for the year ended december  reflects million of net loan charge offs 
see the asset quality section for an analysis of charge offs  nonperforming assets  specific reserves and additional provisions 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the million increase in mortgage banking income was the result of increased origination and sales volumes as well as an increase in average sales margins 
the increase in average sales margins reflects an increase in pricing and fees on all products in all geographic markets  which was consistent with the industry as a whole 
despite the increase in pricing  overall loan origination volumes increased significantly compared to the prior year reflecting the continued strong demand for fixed rate loans carrying historically low interest rates 
loans originated for sale in the secondary market totaled billion during the year ended december   which represents a million  or  increase in originations from the year ended december   which totaled billion 
our overall margin can be affected by the mix of both loan type conventional loans versus governmental and loan purpose purchase versus refinance 
during the year ended december   the growth in loan origination volume resulted in a shift towards lower yielding conventional loans and loans made for the purposes of refinancing  however  margins increased for all loan types and loan purpose  compared to the year ended december  loans originated to purchase residential property  which generally yield a higher margin than loans originated to refinance an existing loan  comprised of total originations during the year ended december   compared to during the year ended december  the mix of loan type changed slightly with conventional loans and governmental loans comprising and of all loan originations  respectively  during the year ended december  during the year ended december  conventional loans and governmental loans comprised and of all loan originations  respectively 
conventional loans include loans that conform to fannie mae and freddie mac standards  whereas governmental loans are those loans guaranteed by the federal government  such as a federal housing authority or us department of agriculture 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and other noninterest expense related to our mortgage banking segment 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  due primarily to an increase in loan origination activity  total compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits at our mortgage banking subsidiary increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in compensation expense at our mortgage banking subsidiary resulted from the increase in mortgage banking income and higher compensation for our mortgage banking loan officers under commission based compensation structure 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefits at our banking segment increased  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  real estate owned expense decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  real estate owned expense includes the operating costs related to the properties  net of rental income 
in addition  it includes net gain or loss recognized upon the sale of foreclosed property  as well as write downs recognized to maintain the properties at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
the decrease in real estate owned expense results from a decrease in net property management expense and an increase in net gains on the sales of properties  partially offset by an increase in write downs of asset values 
during the year ended december   net operating expense  which includes property taxes  maintenance and management fees  net of rental income  decreased million  or  to million from million during the year ended december  the decrease in net operating expense compared to the prior period resulted from both an improvement in the operating results of income producing properties as well as a decrease in the number and balance of properties owned 
total real estate owned decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  net losses recognized on the sale or write down of real estate owned totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  other noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase resulted from a million increase in operational costs related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  income taxes 
despite pre tax income of million for the year ended december   we recognized a net income tax benefit of million 
the million benefit was primarily the result of the december  full reversal of million of remaining net deferred tax asset valuation allowances originally established in from until the end of  a valuation allowance was necessary largely because of cumulative losses for three or more consecutive years as a result of significant loan loss provisions and related asset quality issues  combined with real estate instability and general economic weakness 
at december   however  pretax income in each of the four quarters of and for the year  the existence of federal income taxes paid during the year ended december  and available for carry back in future years  the stabilization of real estate markets and general improvements in economic conditions indicated that it was more likely than not that net deferred tax assets will be realized in future periods 
the million in deferred federal and state income tax benefit for the year ended december  was partially offset by million in current federal and state income tax expense 
despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  tax expense is comprised of current estimated expense of million resulting from an irs audit of tax years through which is still in progress  plus current estimated state income tax expense of  related to mortgage banking operations apportioned to states in which taxes are based on separate company operations 
this was partially offset by current income tax benefit of  for an intra period tax allocation between other comprehensive income and loss from continuing operations  and represents an out of period adjustment for an error that originated in which was corrected during the quarter ended june  the correction of the error was not material to the year ended december comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and general 
net loss for the year ended december  totaled million  or for both basic and diluted loss per share  compared to a net loss of million  or for both basic and diluted loss per share  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  we had a loss on average assets of and a loss on average equity of  compared to a loss on average assets of and a loss on average equity of for the year ended december  the results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  reflect a million increase in real estate owned expense  a million decrease in net interest income and a million decrease in pre tax results of operations from our mortgage banking subsidiary partially offset by a million reduction in the provision for loan losses

total interest income decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans outstanding to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income on loans also reflects a basis point decrease in the average yield on loans to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  interest income from mortgage related securities decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the average yield on mortgage related securities to for the year ended december  from during the year ended december  the decrease in interest income from mortgage related securities also reflects a million  or  decrease in the average balance of mortgage related securities to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decline in the average balance of mortgage related securities during the year ended december  reflects management decision to deemphasize investments in mortgage related securities and emphasize more liquid  less volatile  government agency and municipal securities 
finally  interest income from other interest earning assets comprised of debt securities  federal funds sold and short term investments decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in the average yield on other earning assets to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decline in average yield provided by these assets reflects the lower overall interest rate environment as opposed to a shift in investment strategy and product mix 
the decrease in interest income due to a decline in average yield was partially offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of other earning assets to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase in average balance reflects a strategic shift towards investments which provide higher levels of liquidity 
we intend to maintain higher than usual liquidity given the current economic environment and relatively low rates of return available on loans and mortgage related securities 
total interest expense 
total interest expense decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this decrease was the result of a decrease of basis points in the average cost of funds to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average cost of funds as well as a decrease of million  or  in average interest bearing deposits and borrowings outstanding to billion for the year ended december  compared to an average balance of billion for the year ended december  interest expense on deposits decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  this was due to a decrease in the cost of average deposits of basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the cost of deposits reflects the low interest rate environment due to the federal reserve board low short term interest rate policy 
these rates are typically used by financial institutions in pricing deposit products 
the decrease in interest expense attributable to the decrease in the cost of deposits was compounded by a decrease of million  or  in the average balance of interest bearing deposits to billion during the year ended december  from billion during the year ended december  during the year ended december   proceeds received from the loan principal pay downs were primarily utilized to maintain a higher than normal level of liquidity 
consistent with our liquidity needs and funding obligations we reduced our level of higher cost time deposits during the year ended december  interest expense on borrowings decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a million  or  decrease in average borrowings outstanding to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the average balance as well as a decrease in the cost of borrowings of seven basis points to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decreased use of borrowings as a source of funding during the year ended december  reflects our decision to utilize core deposits as our primary funding source 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the year ended december  the decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a reduction in the loan portfolio during the year and a change in the composition of interest earning assets that became more weighted towards lower yielding other earning assets during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   partially offset by a decrease in time deposits and borrowings during the year ended december provision for loan losses 
our provision for loan losses decreased million  or  to million during the year ended december   from million during the year ended december  while the provision for loan losses has decreased from the prior year  it remains at high levels 
these levels remain high due to continued general economic stress resulting in reduced levels of income earned by many of our borrowers combined with loan collateral values  primarily real estate  that remain at levels below those estimated at the time the loans were originally made 
these factors result in higher levels of actual loss experience which when applied to the portfolio in general require higher loan loss provisions 
they also result in more loans exhibiting risk characteristics that require estimated loan loss provisions in excess of our historical average experience rates 
these risk characteristics include reduced borrower cash flow  reduced borrower fico scores and known declines in collateral value even though the loan may still be performing 
the provision for the year ended december  reflects million of net loan charge offs combined with continued weakness in local real estate markets which required an overall increase to the allowance for loan losses 
noninterest income 
total noninterest income increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the increase resulted primarily from an increase in mortgage banking income 
mortgage banking income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the million increase in mortgage banking income was primarily the result of an increase in average sales margin which was driven by the following factors an increase in pricing on all products in all geographic markets  a change in product mix towards real estate purchase loans which yield a higher margin than loans originated for the purpose of a refinancing and change in the geographic composition of origination activity towards higher yielding geographic markets 
despite the increase in pricing  overall loan origination volumes remained relatively consistent which reflects the continued strong demand for fixed rate loans due in large part to historically low interest rates on these products 
while the loan origination volume remained relatively consistent during the years ended december  and  there was a shift in the mix of loan purpose toward loans originated for the purpose of a residential property purchase  which yield a higher return  as opposed to a loan originated for the purpose of refinancing an existing mortgage loan 
during the year ended december   approximately of all loans were originated for purchase and were originated to refinance an existing loan 
during the year ended december   approximately of all loans were originated for purchase and were originated to refinance an existing loan 
in addition to the shift in product mix during the year ended december   there was a shift in origination volume by geographic market 
loan origination volumes increased by a combined million during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  with respect to three of our higher yielding geographic markets 
in addition  during the same time frame  loan origination volumes decreased by approximately million in one of our lower yielding geographic markets 
while margins increased in all markets  this shift in origination volumes by market resulted in higher average margins during the year ended december  noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation  real estate owned expense and other noninterest expense 
compensation  payroll taxes and other employee benefit expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in compensation is primarily the result of an increase in commissions paid to loan originators by our mortgage banking subsidiary and correlates to the increase in mortgage banking income 
loan commissions increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  real estate owned expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  real estate owned expense includes the net operating and carrying costs related to the properties 
in addition  it includes net gain or loss recognized upon the sale of a foreclosed property  as well as write downs recognized to maintain the properties at their estimated fair value 
the increase in real estate owned expense results from an increase in properties under management and an increase in write downs of asset values  which is reflective of a strategy to become more aggressive in pricing specific properties to expedite the sale process 
during the year ended december   net operating expense  which includes but is not limited to property taxes  maintenance and management fees  net of rental income increased  or  to million from million during the year ended december  the increase in net operating expense compared to the prior period resulted from an increase in the number of properties owned 
the average balance of real estate owned totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses recognized on write down of real estate owned net of net gains on sales totaled million during the year ended december   compared to  during the year ended december  other noninterest expense increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  the increase resulted from an increase in operational costs related to the expansion of our mortgage banking operations to million for the year ended december  from million during income taxes 
despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  tax expense is comprised of current estimated expense of million resulting from an internal revenue service audit of tax years through  plus current estimated state income tax expense of  related to mortgage banking operations apportioned to states in which taxes are based on separate company operations 
these were partially offset by current income tax benefit of  for an intra period tax allocation between other comprehensive income and loss from continuing operations  and represents an out of period adjustment for an error that originated beginning in that was corrected during the quarter ended june  the correction of the error was not material to the years ended december  or despite a pre tax loss  we recorded income tax expense of  for the year ended december  primarily due to differences between prior year estimates and actual tax returns filed plus state income tax due to taxable income generated by the mortgage banking subsidiary 
due to the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  we were not able to record an income tax benefit related to the pre tax loss incurred 
a current income tax benefit that would normally result from a pre tax loss was offset by additional deferred tax expense due to an increase in the required valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources we maintain liquid assets at levels we consider adequate to meet our liquidity needs 
our liquidity ratio averaged and for the years ended december  and the liquidity ratio is equal to average daily cash and cash equivalents for the period divided by average total assets 
we adjust our liquidity levels to fund loan commitments  repay our borrowings  fund deposit outflows and pay real estate taxes on mortgage loans 
we also adjust liquidity as appropriate to meet asset and liability management objectives 
the operational adequacy of our liquidity position at any point in time is dependent upon the judgment of the chief financial officer as supported by the full asset liability committee 
liquidity is monitored on a daily  weekly and monthly basis using a variety of measurement tools and indicators 
regulatory liquidity  as required by the wisconsin department of financial institutions  is based on current liquid assets as a percentage of the prior month average deposits and short term borrowings 
minimum primary liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings and minimum total regulatory liquidity is equal to of deposits and short term borrowings 
the bank primary and total regulatory liquidity at december  were and  respectively 
our primary sources of liquidity are deposits  repayment of loans  sales of loans held for sale  maturities of investment securities and other short term investments  and earnings and funds provided from operations 
while scheduled principal repayments on loans are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows  loan prepayments and the origination and sale of loans held for sale are greatly influenced by market interest rates  economic conditions  and rates offered by our competitors 
we set the interest rates on our deposits to maintain a desired level of total deposits 
in addition  we invest excess funds in short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
additional sources of liquidity for the purpose of managing long and short term cash flows include advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago 
a portion of our liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of our operating  investing and financing activities 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  of our assets were invested in cash and cash equivalents 
our primary sources of cash are principal repayments on loans  proceeds from the calls and maturities of debt and mortgage related securities  increases in deposit accounts  federal funds purchased and advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago 
on october   the federal home loan bank of chicago entered into a consensual cease and desist order with its regulator  the federal housing finance board 
under the terms of the order  capital stock repurchases and redemptions  including redemptions upon membership withdrawal or other termination  are prohibited unless the federal home loan bank of chicago has received approval of the director of the office of supervision of the federal housing finance board the os director 
the order also provides that dividend declarations are subject to the prior written approval of the os director 
we currently hold  at cost  million of federal home loan bank of chicago stock  all of which we believe we will ultimately be able to recover 
during  the federal home loan bank of chicago received authorization to resume dividend payments to its members and received authorization to initiate an excess stock repurchase plan 
subject to a quarterly assessment of the federal home loan bank of chicago capacity to repurchase  the stock repurchase plan will allow for the repurchase of member bank excess stock that they no longer wish to hold 
our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the years ended december   and  loan repayments net of loan originations generated positive cash flows of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in loans receivable is reflective of the general decline in loan demand for variable rate residential real estate mortgage loans combined with the company tightened underwriting standards given the current economic conditions 
cash received from the calls  maturities and principal repayments of debt and mortgage related securities and structured notes totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we purchased million  million and million in debt and mortgage related securities classified as available for sale during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we sold million  million and million in available for sale debt and mortgage related securities during the years ended december   and  respectively 
deposit flows are generally affected by the level of interest rates  market conditions and products offered by local competitors and other factors 
the net decrease in deposits was million during the year ended december  this compares to a net decrease in deposits of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  liquidity management is both a daily and longer term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the federal home loan bank of chicago  which provide an additional source of funds 
at december   we had million in fixed rate advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago  of which none were due within months  but all of which are putable at the option of the federal home loan bank of chicago 
the weighted average rate on these advances was as of december  at december   we had outstanding commitments to originate loans of million and unfunded commitments under construction loans  lines of credit and standby letters of credit of million 
at december   certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in less than one year totaled million 
based on prior experience  management believes that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in the event a significant portion of our deposits are not retained by us  we will have to utilize other funding sources  such as federal home loan bank of chicago advances or the federal reserve discount window to maintain our level of assets 
however  such borrowings may not be available on attractive terms  or at all  if and when needed 
alternatively  we would reduce our level of liquid assets  such as our cash and cash equivalents and securities available for sale in order to meet funding needs 
in addition  the cost of such deposits may be significantly higher if market interest rates are higher or there is an increased amount of competition for deposits in our market area at the time of renewal

future accounting pronouncements new accounting policies adopted by the company during are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted are discussed below 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects the company financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable sections of this financial review and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued amendments to require an entity to disclose information about offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position 
this information will enable users of an entity financial statements to evaluate the effect or potential effect of netting arrangements with certain financial instruments and derivative instruments 
the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   with retrospective application to the disclosures of all comparative periods presented 
the company will adopt the accounting standard during  as required  and is currently evaluating the impact on its results of operations  financial position  and liquidity 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of waterstone bank have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
quarterly financial information the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly data for the periods indicated quarter ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data unaudited interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses total noninterest income total noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes benefit net income income per share basic income per share diluted unaudited interest income interest expense net interest income provision for loan losses net interest income after provision for loan losses total noninterest income total noninterest expense loss before income taxes income taxes benefit net loss loss per share basic loss per share diluted item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  waterstone bank board of directors has established an asset liability committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
management monitors the level of interest rate risk on a regular basis and the asset liability committee meets at least weekly to review our asset liability policies and interest rate risk position  which are evaluated quarterly 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to minimize the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
we have implemented the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i emphasizing variable rate loans including variable rate one to four family  and commercial real estate loans as well as three to five year commercial real estate balloon loans  ii reducing and shortening the expected average life of the investment portfolio  and iii whenever possible  lengthening the term structure of our deposit base and our borrowings from the fhlbc 
these measures should reduce the volatility of our net interest income in different interest rate environments 
income simulation 
simulation analysis is an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
at least quarterly we review the potential effect changes in interest rates may have on the repayment or repricing of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
our most recent simulation uses projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rate assumptions may have a significant impact on interest income simulation results 
because of the large percentage of loans and mortgage backed securities we hold  rising or falling interest rates may have a significant impact on the actual prepayment speeds of our mortgage related assets that may in turn affect our interest rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayment speeds slow and the average expected lives of our assets would tend to lengthen more than the expected average lives of our liabilities and therefore would most likely have a negative impact on net interest income and earnings 
percentage increase decrease in estimated net annual interest income over months basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual rise in rates unchanged rate scenario basis point gradual decline in rates given the current low point in the interest rate cycle  down scenarios in excess of basis points are not meaningful 
waterstone bank asset liability policy limits projected changes in net average annual interest income to a maximum decline of for various levels of interest rate changes measured over a month period when compared to the flat rate scenario 
in addition  projected changes in the economic value of equity are limited to a maximum decline of to for interest rate movements of to basis points when compared to the flat rate scenario 
these limits are re evaluated on a periodic basis and may be modified  as appropriate 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of reducing forecast net interest income by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of reducing net interest income by 
at december   a basis point gradual increase in interest rates had the effect of reducing the economic value of equity by while a basis point decrease in rates had the effect of increasing the economic value of equity by 
while we believe the assumptions used are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity
