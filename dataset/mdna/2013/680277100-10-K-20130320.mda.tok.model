item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  under specific allocations 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent as those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that deserve management s close attention are deemed to be special mention 
management s determination as to the classification of assets and the amount of estimated valuation allowances is subject to review by the occ  the bank s primary regulator  which can also order the establishment of additional specific or general loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the loan portfolio  will not require us to materially adjust our allowance for loan losses 
the occ  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management believes it has established an adequate estimated allowance for probable loan losses 
management reviews its process quarterly  makes changes as needed  and reports those results at meetings of our audit committee 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the loan portfolio  would not request us to materially adjust our allowance for loan losses at the time of their examination 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
management defines potential problem loans as performing loans rated substandard  that do not meet the definition of a nonperforming loan 
these potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management

deposits the following table sets forth the amount and maturities of deposits of  or more at december  months or less over months through months over months through months over months vi 
return on equity and assets the following table presents selected financial ratios as of december  for the years indicated return on average total assets return on average equity average equity to average assets dividend payout ratio vii 
short term borrowings there were no categories of short term borrowings having an average balance greater than of stockholders equity of the company at the end of the year 

table of contents item a risk factors risk factors the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect the company are described below 
before making an investment decision with respect to any of the company s securities  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties as described below  together with all of the information included herein 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks and uncertainties the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or currently deemed immaterial also may have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s results of operations and financial condition could suffer  possibly materially 
the risks discussed below also include forward looking statements  and actual results may differ substantially from those discussed or implied in these forward looking statements 
earnings risk the company has incurred a net loss in the past and cannot ensure further losses will not be incurred 
the company incurred a net loss of  for and million for  as well as a net loss of million for in light of the persistent challenging economic environment and continuing depressed real estate markets  we cannot ensure we will not incur future losses 
any future losses may affect our ability to meet our expenses or raise additional capital  and may delay the time in which we can resume dividend payments on our common and preferred stock as well as distributions on our trust preferred securities 
furthermore  any future losses would likely cause a decline in our holding company regulatory capital ratios  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
if we fail to maintain sufficient capital  whether due to losses  an inability to raise additional capital or otherwise  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations  as well as our ability to maintain regulatory compliance  would be adversely affected 
the company and the bank must meet minimum regulatory capital requirements and maintain sufficient liquidity 
we also face significant capital and other regulatory requirements as a financial institution and a participant in the cpp 
our ability to raise additional capital  when and if needed  will depend on conditions in the economy and capital markets  and a number of other factors including investor perceptions regarding the company  banking industry and market condition  and governmental activities many of which are outside our control  and on our financial condition and performance 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we fail to meet these capital and other regulatory requirements  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
specifically  pursuant to the may consent order with the occ  the bank agreed to maintain a tier leverage ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
the bank was in compliance with the heightened capital requirements required by the occ as of december  however  if the bank fails to be in full compliance with the agreed upon capital ratios in the future  the occ may take additional regulatory enforcement actions 

table of contents nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  and could result in further losses in the future 
at december   our nonperforming loans which consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due days or more  still accruing interest and restructured loans still accruing interest and our nonperforming assets which include nonperforming loans plus other real estate owned oreo are reflected in the table below in millions change nonperforming loans oreo nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways 
for example  we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans and oreo has expenses in excess of lease revenues collected  thereby adversely affecting our income and returns on assets and equity 
our loan administration costs also increase because of our nonperforming assets 
the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant time commitments from management  which can be detrimental to the performance of their other responsibilities 
while we have made progress  there is no assurance that we will not experience further increases in nonperforming loans in the future  or that our nonperforming assets will not result in further losses in the future 
interest rate and credit risks the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions our competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence the amount of interest the company earns on loans and securities and the amount of interest it incurs on deposits and borrowings 
such changes could also affect the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits as well as the average duration of the company s securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company is subject to lending risks 
there are inherent risks associated with the company s lending activities 
underwriting and documentation controls cannot mitigate all credit risk  especially those outside the company s control 
these risks include the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets in which the company operates as well as those across the united states 
increases in interest rates and or continuing weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing those loans 

table of contents the company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil monetary penalties against the company 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings  an increase in the provision for loan losses  and an increase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
our loan portfolio is concentrated heavily in residential and commercial real estate loans  including construction loans  which involve risks specific to real estate values and the real estate markets in general  all of which have been experiencing significant weakness 
our loan portfolio generally reflects the profile of the communities in which we operate 
because we are in areas that saw rapid growth between and  real estate lending of all types is a significant portion of our loan portfolio with total real estate lending at billion  or approximately of our december  loan portfolio 
given that the primary if not only source of collateral on these loans is real estate  additional adverse developments affecting real estate values in our market area could increase the credit risk associated with our real estate loan portfolio 
the effects of ongoing real estate challenges  combined with the ongoing correction in commercial and residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales  have adversely affected our real estate loan portfolio and have the potential to further adversely affect such portfolio in several ways  each of which could further adversely impact our operating results and or financial condition 
real estate market volatility and future changes in disposition strategies could result in net proceeds that differ significantly from fair value appraisals of loan collateral and oreo and could negatively impact the company s operating performance 
many of the company s non performing real estate loans are collateral dependent  meaning the repayment of the loan is largely dependent upon the successful operation of the property securing the loan 
for collateral dependent loans  the company estimates the value of the loan based on appraised value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell 
the company s oreo portfolio consists of properties acquired through foreclosure in partial or total satisfaction of certain loans as a result of borrower defaults 
oreo is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loans for which the property served as collateral or estimated fair value  less estimated selling costs 
in determining the value of oreo properties and loan collateral  an orderly disposition of the property is generally assumed 
significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of property  and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility 
the company s allowance for loan losses may be insufficient to absorb potential losses in our loan portfolio 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses allowance at a level believed adequate to absorb estimated losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  credit loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political  and regulatory conditions  and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 

table of contents determination of the allowance is inherently subjective since it requires significant estimates and management judgment of credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
for example  the final allowance for december  included an amount reserved for other not specifically identified risk factors 
continuing deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans  and other factors  both within and outside of the company s control  may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review the company s allowance and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge offs  based on judgments different from those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses  the company will need additional provisions to increase the allowance 
any increases in the allowance will result in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
the company may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions 
this information could include financial statements  credit reports  and other financial information 
the company may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties  or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports  or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
funding risks the company could experience an unexpected inability to obtain needed liquidity 
liquidity measures the ability to meet current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
the liquidity of a financial institution reflects its ability to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities and is essential to a financial institution s business 
the ability of a financial institution to meet its current financial obligations is a function of its balance sheet structure  its ability to liquidate assets  and its access to alternative sources of funds 
the company seeks to ensure its funding needs are met by maintaining a level of liquidity through asset and liability management 
if the company becomes unable to obtain funds when needed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
loss of customer deposits could increase the company s funding costs 
the company relies on bank deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding 
the company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits 
if the company s competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits  the company s funding costs may increase  either because the company raises its rates to avoid losing deposits or because the company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding 
higher funding costs could reduce the company s net interest margin and net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on business demand deposits could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  some financial institutions have commenced offering interest on these demand deposits to compete for customers 
if competitive pressures require us to pay interest on these demand deposits to attract and retain business customers  our interest expense would increase and our net interest margin would decrease 
this could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  the effect of the repeal of the prohibition could be more significant in a higher interest rate environment as business customers would have a greater incentive to seek interest on demand deposits 
operational risks our business is concentrated in and dependent upon the welfare of several counties in illinois and the state of illinois 
our primary market area is aurora  illinois  and surrounding communities as well as southwestern cook county 
the city of aurora is located in northeastern illinois  approximately miles west of chicago 
the bank operates primarily in kane  kendall  dekalb  dupage  lasalle  will and cook counties in illinois  and  as a result  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to changes and fluctuations in the economic conditions in those areas 
we have developed a strong presence in the counties we serve  with particular concentration in aurora  illinois  and surrounding communities 
the communities that we serve grew rapidly over the past decade  and we intend to continue concentrating our business efforts in these communities 
our future success is largely dependent upon the overall economic health of these communities 
however  since late  the united states economy has generally experienced difficult economic conditions 
weak economic conditions are characterized by  among other indicators  deflation  unemployment  fluctuations in debt and equity capital markets  increased delinquencies on mortgage  commercial and consumer loans  residential and commercial real estate price declines and lower home sales and commercial activity 
all of those factors are generally detrimental to our business 
if the overall economic conditions fail to significantly improve or decline further  particularly within our primary market areas  we could experience a lack of demand for our products and services  an increase in loan delinquencies and defaults and high or increased levels of problem assets and foreclosures 
moreover  because of our geographic concentration  we are less able than other regional or national financial institutions to diversify our credit risks across multiple markets 
similarly  we have credit exposure to entities or in industries that could be impacted by the continued financial difficulties at the state level 
exposure to health care  construction and social services organizations has been reviewed to evaluate credit impact from a possible reorganization of state finances 
credit downgrades  partial charge offs and specific reserves could develop in this exposure with resulting impact on our financial condition if the state of illinois encounters more severe payment issuance capabilities 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in accounting principles  policies  or guidelines 
the company s financial performance is impacted by accounting principles  policies  and guidelines 
some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of the company s assets or liabilities and financial results 
some of the company s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult  subjective  and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
if such estimates or assumptions underlying the company s financial statements are incorrect  it may experience material losses 

table of contents from time to time  the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards or the interpretation of those standards that govern the preparation of the company s external financial statements 
these changes are beyond the company s control  can be difficult to predict  and could materially impact how the company reports its results of operations and financial condition 
changes in these standards are continuously occurring  and given the current economic environment  more drastic changes may occur 
the implementation of such changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates the company s loan underwriting and monitoring process  internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
loss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers 
the company s business is primarily relationship driven in that many of its key employees have extensive customer relationships 
loss of key employees with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor 
while the company believes its relationships with its key personnel are strong  it cannot guarantee that all of its key personnel will remain with the organization 
loss of such key personnel  should they enter into an employment relationship with one of the company s competitors  could result in the loss of some of its customers  which could have a negative impact on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on internal and outsourced technologies  communications  and information systems to conduct its business 
as the company s reliance on technology has increased  so have the potential risks of a technology related operation interruption such as disruptions in the company s customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan  or other systems or the occurrence of a cyber incident such as unauthorized access to the company s systems 
cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events including i gaining unauthorized access to automated systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information  corrupting data  or causing operational disruptions  ii causing denial of service attacks on websites  or iii intelligence gathering and social engineering aimed at obtaining information 
the occurrence of operational interruption or a deficiency in the cyber security of the company s technology systems internal or outsourced could negatively impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company is dependent upon outside third parties for processing and handling of company records and data 
the company relies on software developed by third party vendors to process various company transactions 
in some cases  the company has contracted with third parties to run its proprietary software on behalf of the company 
these systems include  but are not limited to  general ledger  payroll  wealth 
table of contents management record keeping  and securities portfolio management 
while the company performs a review of controls instituted by the vendor over these programs in accordance with industry standards and institutes its own user controls  the company must rely on the continued maintenance of these many controls by the outside party  including safeguards over the security of customer data 
in addition  the company maintains backups of key processing output daily in the event of a failure on the part of any of these systems 
nonetheless  the company may incur a temporary disruption in its ability to conduct its business or process its transactions  or incur damage to its reputation if the third party vendor fails to adequately maintain internal controls or institute necessary changes to systems 
such disruption or breach of security may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s estimate of fair values for its investments may not be realizable if it were to sell these securities today 
the company s available for sale securities are carried at fair value 
accounting standards require the company to categorize these securities according to a fair value hierarchy 
as of december   percent of the company s available for sale securities were categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy meaning that the fair values were based on quoted market prices 
approximately  of the company s available for sale securities were categorized in level of the fair value hierarchy meaning that their fair values were determined by quoted prices for similar instruments or other observable inputs 
the remaining securities were categorized as level meaning that their fair values were determined by inputs that are unobservable in the market and therefore require a greater degree of management judgment 
the determination of fair value for securities categorized in level involves significant judgment due to the complexity of factors contributing to the valuation  many of which are not readily observable in the market 
the market disruptions in recent years made the valuation process even more difficult and subjective 
external risks the company operates in a highly competitive industry and market area 
the company faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
our competitors primarily include national and regional banks as well as community banks within the markets we serve 
the company also faces competition from savings and loan associations  credit unions  personal loan and finance companies  retail and discount stockbrokers  investment advisors  mutual funds  insurance companies  and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative and regulatory changes 
banks  securities firms  and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer the wide spectrum of financial services to many customer segments 
many large scale competitors can leverage economies of scale and be able to offer better pricing for products and services compared to what the company can offer 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on developing  maintaining  and building long term customer relationships  offering community banking services with features and pricing in line with customer interests  consistently achieving outstanding levels of customer service as well as adapting to many and frequent change in banking as well as local or regional economies 
failure to excel in these areas could significantly weaken the company s competitive position  which could adversely affect the company s growth and profitability 
these weaknesses could have a significant negative impact on the 
table of contents company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
legal compliance risks we may be materially and adversely affected by the highly regulated environment in which we operate 
we are subject to extensive federal and state regulation  supervision and examination 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  fdic funds  customers and the banking system as a whole  rather than stockholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy  and growth  among other things 
as a bank holding company  we are subject to extensive regulation and supervision and undergo periodic examinations by our regulators  who have extensive discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of law by banks and bank holding companies 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil monetary penalties  and or damage to our reputation  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
although we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
the primary federal and state banking laws and regulations that affect us are described in this report under the section captioned supervision and regulation in item these laws  regulations  rules  standards  policies and interpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time 
for example  on july   the dodd frank act was signed into law  which significantly changed the regulation of financial institutions and the financial services industry 
the dodd frank act  together with the regulations to be developed thereunder  includes provisions affecting large and small financial institutions alike  including several provisions that affect how community banks  thrifts and small bank and thrift holding companies will be regulated 
in addition  the federal reserve  in recent years  has adopted numerous new regulations addressing banks overdraft and mortgage lending practices 
further  the cfpb was recently established  with broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws  and additional consumer protection legislation and regulatory activity is anticipated in the near future 
in september  the group of governors and heads of supervision  the oversight body of the basel committee on banking supervision  adopted basel iii  which constitutes a strengthened set of capital requirements for banking organizations in the united states and around the world 
basel iii is currently the subject of notices of proposed rulemakings released in june of by the respective federal bank regulatory agencies 
the comment period for these notices of proposed rulemakings ended on october   but final regulations have not yet been released 
basel iii was intended to be implemented beginning january  and to be fully phased in on a global basis on january  however  on november   the us federal bank regulatory agencies announced that the implementation of the proposed rules under basel iii was indefinitely delayed 
if and when implemented in the united states  basel iii would require capital to be held in the form of tangible common equity  generally increase the required capital ratios  phase out certain kinds of intangibles treated as capital and certain types of instruments  like trust preferred securities  and change the risk weightings of assets used to determine required capital ratios 
such changes  including changes regarding interpretations and implementation  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer  and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 

table of contents the policies of the federal reserve also have a significant impact on us 
among other things  the federal reserve s monetary policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest bearing deposits  and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold and the ability of borrowers to repay their loans  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
the company and its subsidiaries may not be able to realize the benefit of deferred tax assets 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the deferred tax assets can be recognized in future periods dependent upon a number of factors  including the ability to realize the asset through carrybacks or carryforwards to taxable income in prior or future years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income  and the possible application of future tax planning strategies 
the company s fully reserved deferred tax asset may not be recoverable with resulting adverse impact on the company s capital and potentially capital ratios 
the company is subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to the company s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to the company s performance of its fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  if such claims and legal action are not resolved in a manner favorable to the company  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect the market perception of the company and its products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputational damage could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company is a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions 
currently  there are certain other legal proceedings pending against the company and its subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of any legal proceeding is inherently uncertain  based on information currently available  the company s management believes that any liabilities arising from pending legal matters would have a material adverse effect on the bank or on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
however  if actual results differ from management s expectations  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
risks associated with the company s common stock the trading volume in the company s common stock is less than that of other larger financial services institutions 
although the company s common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq stock market exchange  the trading volume in its common stock may be less than that of other  larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity  and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of the company s common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which the company has no control 
during any period of lower trading volume of the company s common stock  significant sales of shares of the company s common stock  or the 
table of contents expectation of these sales could cause the company s common stock price to fall 
the company has not established a minimum dividend payment level  and it cannot ensure its ability to pay dividends in the future 
our july written agreement with the federal reserve includes restrictions on the company s payment of dividends on our common stock 
in addition  the federal reserve has issued federal reserve supervision and regulation letter sr  which requires bank holding companies to inform and consult with federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring and paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid 
under this regulation  if the company experiences losses in a series of consecutive quarters  it may be required to inform and consult with the federal reserve supervisory staff prior to declaring or paying any dividends 
in this event  there can be no assurance that the company s regulators will approve the payment of such dividends 
we have deferred interest payments on our junior subordinated debentures and dividends on the series b preferred stock  and the failure to resume payments may adversely affect the company and the stockholders 
in the third quarter of  the company elected to defer regularly scheduled interest payments on million of junior subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities issued by its two statutory trust subsidiaries  old second capital trust i and old second capital trust ii collectively  the trust preferred securities 
because of the deferral on the junior subordinated debentures  the trusts have deferred regularly scheduled dividends on the trust preferred securities 
the total accumulated interest on the junior subordinated debentures including compounded interest from july  on the deferred payments totaled million at december  the company has also suspended quarterly cash dividends on its series b preferred stock  issued to the us treasury in connection with the company s participation in the tarp capital purchase program 
dividend payments on the series b preferred stock may be deferred without default  but the dividend is cumulative and therefore will continue to accrue 
the dividends have been deferred since november   and the accumulated series b preferred stock dividends totaled million at december  the company is allowed to defer payments of interest for quarterly periods on the junior subordinated debentures without default or penalty  but such amounts will continue to accrue 
also during the deferral period  the company generally may not pay cash dividends on or repurchase its common stock or preferred stock  including the series b preferred stock 
in february   the company did not pay the required dividend to treasury for the sixth time and as a result  the treasury has the right to appoint two representatives to the company s board of directors 
the treasury appointed a representative to our board of directors during the fourth quarter of the terms of the series b preferred stock also prevent the company from paying cash dividends on or repurchasing its common stock while series b preferred stock dividends are in arrears 
the holders of our debt have rights that are senior to those of our stockholders 
we currently have a million credit facility with a correspondent lender  which includes million of subordinated debt and  in term debt 
as of december   the entire million of principal was outstanding 
the term debt and subordinated debt mature on march  the senior debt is secured by all of the capital stock of the bank 
at december   the company continued to be out of compliance with two of the financial covenants contained within the credit 
table of contents agreement  which constitutes an event of default 
in addition  as of december   we also had million in junior subordinated debentures related to the trust preferred securities 
payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities are conditionally guaranteed by us to the extent the trusts have funds available for such obligations 
the rights of the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures are senior to the shares of our common stock and senior preferred stock 
as a result  we must make payments on our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock or preferred stock and  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to our stockholders 
the holders of our senior preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common stockholders 
in january  we issued and sold  shares of our series b preferred stock  which ranks senior to our common stock in the payment of dividends and on liquidation  to the treasury together with the warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock for million 
during the first quarter of  treasury sold substantially all of series b preferred stock to third party investors and certain of our directors in a public auction 
it is anticipated that after the close of the initial auction that treasury will sell the remaining shares of series b preferred stock in a subsequent auction  which is expected to close by the end of first quarter or early in second quarter in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution  or liquidation  the holders of the series b preferred stock will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock but after the holders of our senior debt  subordinated debt and junior subordinated debentures 
holders of our series b preferred stock have certain voting rights that may adversely affect our common stock holders  and the holders of the series b preferred stock may have interests different from our common shareholders 
as a consequence of our missing the sixth dividend payment on our series b preferred stock  the treasury had the right to appoint two directors to our board of directors until all accrued but unpaid dividends have been paid

the company paid no dividends in or as set forth in the table above 
the company s shareholders are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore 
the company s ability to pay dividends to shareholders is largely dependent upon the dividends it receives from the bank  and the bank is subject to regulatory limitations on the amount of cash dividends it may pay

as of december   we had million of junior subordinated debentures held by two statutory business trusts that we control 
we have the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  which were approximately million in the year ended december   for a period of up to consecutive quarters  and we elected to begin such a deferral period in august all deferred interest must be paid before we may pay dividends on our capital stock 
therefore  we will not be able to pay dividends on our common stock until all deferred interest on these debentures has been paid in full 
the total amount of such deferred interest as of december   was million 
furthermore  as with the debentures discussed above  the company is prohibited from paying dividends on its common stock unless it has fully paid all accrued dividends on its series b preferred stock 
in august  the company also announced the payment deferral of dividends on such preferred stock 
therefore  in addition to paying all the accrued and unpaid distributions on the debentures set forth above  the company must also fully pay the treasury all accrued and unpaid dividends on the series b preferred stock before it may reinstate the payment of dividends on the common stock 
dividend payments on the series b preferred stock may be deferred without default  but the dividend is cumulative and therefore will continue to accrue and  if the company fails to pay dividends for an aggregate of six quarters  whether or not consecutive  the holder will have the right to appoint representatives to the company s board of directors 
a new director was appointed by the treasury to join the board during the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  treasury included the company s series b preferred stock in an auction to third parties and treasury sold substantially all of the series b preferred stock to third party investors and certain of our directors

the company provides a wide range of financial services through its twenty seven banking locations located in cook  kane  kendall  dekalb  dupage  lasalle and will counties in illinois 
these banking centers offer access to a full menu of traditional retail and commercial banking services including treasury management operations as well as corporate and personal trust services 
the company focuses its business upon establishing and maintaining relationships with its clients while maintaining a commitment to providing for the financial services needs of the communities in which it operates through its retail branch network

the company also has extensive wealth management services  which now include a registered investment advisory platform in addition to trust administration and trust services related to personal and corporate trusts  including employee benefit plan administration services 
although the precipitous rate of valuation decline in certain real estate assets appeared to have slowed generally in the latter part of  overall economic sluggishness including continued high levels of unemployment continued to result in declines in the values of real estate and associated asset types during the reporting period that ended december   particularly in the company s market area 
the availability of ready local markets for real estate remained limited and continued to affect the ability of many borrowers to pay on their obligations 
the company s pre tax losses for december   and were  and million  respectively 
the company recorded income tax expense totaling million in as it established a valuation reserve on substantially all of its deferred tax assets 
in and  management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not and maintained a full valuation 
table of contents allowance on net deferred tax assets 
considerations in making this tax valuation estimate included forecasts of future income  available tax planning strategies  and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
in each subsequent accounting period  the company s management has reevaluated current conditions to consider support for a change in the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
any such subsequent reduction in the estimated valuation allowance would lower the amount of income tax expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations in future periods 
a discussion related to realizability of tax benefits and related items is included in our results of operations that follows as well as in notes and of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in  the bank continued to reposition its balance sheet to reduce asset quality risk  maintain its capital ratios  and liquidity and improve asset quality

management has emphasized continuing its open dialogue with customers  employees  stakeholders and regulators 
a discussion of regulatory matters including the compliance of the bank with the consent order is detailed in the supervisory and regulation section of item at this form k and in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the bank continued to work to address key asset quality and liquidity issues throughout at the same time  the bank expanded upon its core competencies by broadening the platform of services offered in the wealth management unit by adding investment advisory management services and continued with a high level of profit contribution from the mortgage origination unit despite difficulties in the larger economy and underlying real estate markets 
the company s primary deposit products are checking  now  money market  savings  and certificate of deposit accounts  and the company s primary lending products are commercial mortgages  construction lending  commercial loans  residential mortgages and consumer loans 
major portions of the company s loans are secured by various forms of collateral including real estate  business assets  and consumer property while borrower cash flow is the primary source of repayment at the time of loan origination

average loans  including loans held for sale during the year  decreased million  in part  from a continued low level of qualified borrower demand within the company s market areas  combined with charge off activity 
average interest bearing liabilities decreased million  or  from billion in to billion in  as the need for funding decreased with the reduction in assets 
application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the banking industry 
application of 
table of contents these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
future changes in information may affect these estimates  assumptions  and judgments  which  in turn  may affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
significant accounting policies are presented in note of the financial statements included in this annual report 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management has determined that the company s accounting policies with respect to the allowance for loan losses is an accounting area requiring subjective or complex judgments very important to the company s financial position and results of operations 
therefore  the allowance policy is one of the company s most critical accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the amount of estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans are based on historical loss experience  consideration of current economic trends and conditions  as well as estimated collateral valuations  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheets 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for loan losses  increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the allowance balance required using an assessment of various risk factors including  but not limited to  past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations  estimated collateral values  volume trends in delinquencies  nonaccruals  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all contractual principal or interest due will be received according to the original terms of the loan agreement 
management defines the measured value of an impaired loan based upon the present value of the future cash flows  discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  or the fair value of underlying collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
impaired loans at december   and  were million and million  respectively 
in addition  a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the provision for loan losses section that follows 
the company recognizes expense for federal and state income taxes currently payable as well as deferred federal and state taxes  estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets  as well as loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
the company maintained net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences  the largest of which related to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes as it relates to lending activities  only net charge offs are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in either the carryforward or carryback periods to cover net operating losses generated by the reversal of temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided by way of a charge to income tax expense if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
that determination is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of current and future economic and business conditions 
management considered both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
examples of positive evidence may include the existence  if any  of taxes paid in available carry back years and the likelihood that taxable income will be 
table of contents generated in future periods 
examples of negative evidence included a cumulative loss and negative general business and economic trends 
management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not as required by accounting principles and established a valuation allowance to reflect this judgment 
management believed internal projections and positive evidence was not sufficient under generally accepted accounting principles to overcome the negative evidence present at december in both and this was based  in part  upon the lack of certainty of future projections to support the deferred tax assets from an accounting standpoint and based upon that guidance a valuation reserve was needed 
this determination was based  largely  on the negative evidence of a cumulative loss caused primarily by the loan loss provisions made during the last four years 
in addition  general uncertainty surrounding future economic and business conditions increased the likelihood of volatility in future earnings 
accrual of income taxes payable and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets are estimates subject to change based upon the outcome of future events 
future issuances or sales of common stock or other equity securities could also result in an ownership change as defined for us federal income tax purposes 
if an ownership change were to occur  the company could realize a loss of a portion of our us federal and state deferred tax assets  including certain built in losses that have not been recognized for tax purposes  as a result of the operation of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the amount of the permanent loss would be determined by the annual limitation period and the carryforward period generally up to years for federal net operating losses and any resulting loss could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial condition 
income tax returns are also subject to audit by the internal revenue service irs and state taxing authorities 
income tax expense for current and prior periods is subject to adjustment based upon the outcome of such audits 
the company believes it has adequately accrued for all probable income taxes payable 
starting january   the company was under examination with the irs for the company s federal income tax filing for the year starting february   the company was under examination with the irs for the company s federal income tax filing for the year also  the company was under examination by the state of illinois for the tax years and years that remain subject to examination are years and for illinois 
another of the company s critical accounting policies relates to the fair value measurement of various nonfinancial and financial instruments including investment securities  valuation of oreo  derivative instruments and the expanded fair value measurement disclosures that are related to accounting standards codification asc in detail in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
results of operations net interest income net interest and dividend income decreased million from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  average earning assets decreased million  or  during to billion as of december   as management continued to emphasize asset quality and funded new loan originations continued to be limited 
the million decrease in year to date average loans and loans held for sale was primarily due to the ongoing decreased demand from qualified borrowers in the bank s market area  charge off activity  and movement of loan assets to oreo  as well as maturities and payments on performing loans 
to utilize available liquid funds  management continued to increase securities available for sale in the fourth quarter of to of total assets up from at september   and at the end of at the same time  management reduced deposits that had previously provided funding for those assets by emphasizing relationship banking rather than single service customers 
as a result  average interest bearing liabilities 
table of contents decreased million  or  during to billion as of december  the net interest margin tax equivalent basis  expressed as a percentage of average earning assets  decreased slightly from in to in the average tax equivalent yield on earning assets decreased from in to  or basis points  in the company s net interest income can be significantly influenced by a variety of factors  including overall economic conditions  credit risk  the amount of nonearning assets including nonperforming loans and oreo  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice  variances in prepayment of loans and securities  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  and balance sheet growth or contraction 
the company s asset and liability committee alco seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring the company s balance sheet and off balance sheet positions  and this process is discussed in more detail in the interest rate risk section 
provision for loan losses in  the company recorded a million provision for loan losses  all of which was made in the first half of the year  as no provision was made in the third and fourth quarters 
in  the provision for loan losses was million  which included a provision of million in the fourth quarter 
provisions for loan losses are made to provide for probable and estimable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
nonperforming loans decreased to million at december   from million at december  charge offs  net of recoveries  totaled million in and improved from million in the distribution of the company s net charge off activity for the periods indicated is detailed in the first table below and the distribution of the company s remaining nonperforming loans and related specific allocations at december   are included in the following tables

the components of the classified loans were as follows in thousands classified loans commercial real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential consumer commercial real estate commercial real estate nonfarm cre loans remained the largest component of nonperforming loans at million  or of total nonperforming loans 
the dollar volume of nonperforming cre loans is down from million at december  these decreases resulted from loans moving to oreo during these periods  loans paying off and loans upgraded as a result of improved performance 
the class components of the cre segment at december   were as follows in thousands 
table of contents cre nonaccrual total days or more past due accruing restructured loans accruing total non performing loans non performing cre loans specific allocation owner occupied general purpose owner occupied special purpose non owner occupied general purpose non owner occupied special purpose retail properties non owner occupied  general purpose loans include credits that are collateralized by office  warehouse  and industrial properties and represented of total cre loans  and of nonperforming cre loans at the end of the fourth quarter of year to date charge offs in this category were million  with most of the charge offs coming from fully allocated credits  and management estimated that  of specific allocation was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  however  there can be no guarantee that actual losses in this category  and all other categories discussed in this section  will not exceed the amount specifically reserved for the category 
the owner occupied special purpose category had loans totaling million  representing of all cre loans 
with million of these loans nonperforming at december   these loans accounted for of total nonperforming cre 
owner occupied special purpose credits include loans collateralized by property types such as car washes  golf courses  restaurants  and medical office buildings 
charge offs in the year ended totaled million in this loan category  and management estimated that the specific allocation of  was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  portfolio loans secured by retail property  primarily retail strip malls  continue to experience financial stress as vacancies and lower rents needed to secure tenants hampered successful retail mall performance 
this class accounted for of all cre loans and of all nonperforming cre loans at december  for the year ended charge offs in the retail segment totaled million in this loan category and management estimated that the specific allocation of million was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  as of december   owner occupied general purpose loans comprised of cre  and of nonperforming cre loans 
charge offs totaled million in the year ending  and management estimated that specific allocations of  was sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure at december  non owner occupied special purpose loans represented of the cre portfolio  and of nonperforming cre loans at december  for the year ended december  there were charge offs of  management has reviewed all nonperforming loans and concluded no additional inherent losses are apparent which would require a specific reserve at december  in addition to the specific allocations detailed above  management estimates include a higher risk commercial real estate pool loss factor for certain cre loans 
these loans typically have a deficiency in cash flow coverage from the property securing the credit  but other supporting factors such as liquidity  guarantor capacity  sufficient global cash flow coverage or cooperation from the borrower is evident to support the credit 
these deficiencies in cash flow coverage are typically attributable to vacancies that are expected to be temporary or reduced operating income from the owner occupant due to continued economic stress in our market areas 
the pool also includes cases where the property securing the credit 
table of contents has adequate cash flow coverage  but the borrower has other economic stress indicators to warrant heightened risk treatment 
due to a decrease in the management factor in this pool and million decrease in the higher risk cre loans from december   management estimated a decrease of reserves of million in the year ending december  office space absorption in our markets  especially in the local tollway corridor  has improved as space in greater chicago is filled forcing tenants to locations in our markets 
healthcare relocations and expansions were evident in the market over the last year and the company was successful in winning a few healthcare related expansion projects 
the current office vacancy rate in the tollway corridor is the lowest seen in five years and medical office space is in expansion mode as smaller practices consolidate into larger medial groups 
similarly  the company s industrial property borrowers both owner and non owner occupied have not encountered high vacancies over the past twelve months 
construction and development at december   nonperforming construction and development c d loans totaled million  or of total nonperforming loans 
this is a decrease of million from million at december  of the million of total c d loans in the portfolio  were nonperforming as of december   as compared to at december  total c d charge offs for the year ending were million  as compared to million in the year ending following all charge off activity  management estimated that specific allocations of million were sufficient coverage for the remaining loss exposure in this segment at december  the majority of the bank s c d loans are located in suburban chicago markets  predominantly in the far western and southwestern suburbs 
the bank s loan exposure to credits secured by homebuilder inventory is down from a year ago 
management closely monitors the performing loans that have been rated as special mention or substandard but that are still accruing interest 
while some additional adverse migration is still possible  management believes that the remaining performing c d borrowers have demonstrated sufficient operating strength through an extended period of weak construction to avoid classification as an impaired credit at december  as a result  management believes future losses in the construction segment will generally continue to trend downward 
in addition to reviewing the operating performance of the borrowers when reviewing allowance estimates  management also continues to update underlying collateral valuation estimates to reflect the aggregate estimated credit exposure 
the c d portfolio no longer dominates the company s cre portfolio and in fact now represents one of the lowest dollar and volume concentrations in the company s loan portfolio 
additionally  overall repayment performance in this segment was substantially improved over the course of residential real estate nonperforming family owner occupied residential mortgages totaled million  or of the nonperforming loan total as of december  this segment totaled million at december  a decrease of 
while kendall  kane  and will counties experienced high rates of foreclosure in both and  the bank has recently experienced somewhat improved nonperforming totals 
the majority of all residential mortgage loans originated today are sold on the secondary market 
of the nonperforming loans in this category   or  are to homeowners enrolled in the bank s foreclosure avoidance program and were classified as restructured at december  the typical concessions granted in these cases were small and temporary rate reductions and a reduced monthly payment with the expectation that these borrowers will resume normal performance on their obligations when their earnings situation improves 
the usual profile of these borrowers includes a decrease in 
table of contents household income resulting from a change or loss of employment 
the remaining nonperforming loans in the family residential category are in nonaccrual status and most cases are in various stages of foreclosure 
management believes that deterioration in the segment relates primarily to the high rate of unemployment in our market areas  which is offset by some reductions from loans moved to oreo or upgraded as borrowers regain employment 
in addition  a significant portion of these nonperforming loans were supported by private mortgage insurance and at december   management estimated that a specific allocation of million was adequate loss coverage following million of charge offs that occurred during the year ending and allowing for recurring problems and delays in collecting on private mortgage insurance 
at december   there were loans of  that were greater than days past due and were still accruing interest in this portion of the portfolio 
additionally  at december   loans to days past due and still accruing totaled million  which was an improvement from million at december  nonperforming residential investor loans at december   consisted of multi family million and family properties million for a total of million  or of the total nonperforming loans 
this represented a decrease from million at december  following the charge offs for year ended of million  management estimated that a total specific allocation of  would provide sufficient loss reserves at december   for the remaining risk in this category 
the multi family and rental market segment is showing improved credit metrics as higher occupancy rates have driven stronger net operating income 
management has seen improvements in the residential real estate markets in our market areas 
with the exception of more remote rural and smaller suburban communities  residential property sales are returning to more normal levels 
other the remaining nonperforming credits included  in commercial loans  million in consumer home equity and second mortgage loans  million in farmland and agricultural loans and  in other loans 
these loan categories have shown stable credit characteristics and losses have been minimal during this economic cycle 
at december   management estimated that a total specific allocation of  on the commercial portfolio would be sufficient loss coverage for the remaining risk in those nonperforming credits and that  was sufficient loss coverage for the consumer home equity 
these estimated amounts were following charge offs during the year ending of  in commercial loans  and million in consumer home equity loans 
management has seen non real estate commercial borrowers receiving benefit from economic recovery as their customer demand is up 
to date  there has been a curtailment in borrowing as our significant commercial borrowers have accumulated cash reserves 
other troubled loans loans that were classified as performing but to days past due and still accruing interest increased to million at december   from million at december  at december   loans to days past due consisted of million in family owner occupied mortgages  million in commercial real estate credits   in residential investor credits   in construction and development   in commercial loans   in consumer loans and million in home equity loans 
tdrs accruing interest were million at december  allowance for loan losses alll the bank s alll methodology reasonably estimates loan and lease losses as of the financial statement 
table of contents date s and incorporates management s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process 
the methodology is done according to us generally accepted accounting practices including  but not limited to  guidance included in accounting standards codification asc and asc  formally known as fas and fas  respectively 
its analysis is prepared in accordance with guidelines established by generally accepted accounting principles  the sec  the ffiec  the aicpa audit and accounting guide for banks and savings institutions  and banking industry practices overall 
this methodology is periodically reviewed by the bank s independent accountants and banking regulators 
the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was as of december   which reflects an increase from as of december  a decrease of million  or  in nonperforming loans in drove the overall coverage ratio change 
management updated the estimated specific allocations in the fourth quarter after receiving more recent appraisal collateral valuations or information on cash flow trends related to the impaired credits 
the estimated general allocations decreased by million from december   as the overall loan balances subject to general factors decreased at december  management determined the estimated amount to include in the allowance for loan losses based upon a number of factors  including loan growth or contraction  the quality and composition of the loan portfolio and loan loss experience 
the latter item was also weighted more heavily based upon recent loss experience 
the c d portfolio has had diminished adverse migration and the remaining credits are exhibiting more stable credit characteristics leading to reduced general allocations at year end management estimates adequate reserves have been established for the remaining risk of loss in the c d portfolio 
management regularly reviews the performance of the higher risk pool within cre loans  and adjusts the population and the related loss factors taking into account adverse market trends including collateral valuation as well as its assessments of the credits in that pool 
those assessments capture management s estimate of the potential for adverse migration to an impaired status as well as its estimation of what the potential valuation impact from that migration would be if it were to occur 
the amount of assets subject to this pool factor decreased by million  or  at december   as compared to december  also  compared to december   management decreased the loss factor assigned to this pool by based on risk characteristics of the remaining credits 
management has also observed that many stresses in those credits were generally attributable to cyclical economic events that are showing some signs of stabilization 
those signs included a reduction in loan migration to watch status  as well as some stabilization in values of certain properties 
management conducts a full annual review of all home equity lines of credit heloc by looking at credit scores and collateral values 
when we are notified of a foreclosure on a first mortgage  our heloc loan is moved to nonaccrual and a decision is made if the loan is collectible 
we actively charge off loan balances in the absence of sufficient equity unless the borrower reaffirms or notifies us on an intention to reaffirm 
the above changes in estimates were made by management to be consistent with observable trends within loan portfolio segments and in conjunction with market conditions and credit review administration activities 
several environmental factors are also evaluated on an ongoing basis and are included in the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
when measured as a percentage of loans outstanding  the total allowance for loan losses decreased from of total loans as of december   to of total loans at december  in management s judgment  an adequate allowance for estimated losses has been established for inherent losses at december   however  there can be no assurance that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts in the future 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses consists of three components i specific allocations established for losses resulting from an analysis developed through reviews of individual impaired loans for which the recorded investment in the loan exceeds the measured value of the loan  ii reserves based on historical loss experience for each loan category  and iii reserves based on general current economic conditions as well as specific economic and other factors believed to be relevant to the company s loan portfolio 
the components of the allowance for loan losses represent an estimation performed pursuant to asc topic  contingencies  and asc topic  receivables including accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
see note on summary of significant accounting policies for further detail 
the analysis of these factors involves a high degree of judgment by management 
because of the imprecision surrounding these factors  the company estimates a range of inherent losses and maintains a general allowance that is not allocated to a specific category 
changes in the allowance for loan losses are detailed in note on the consolidated financial statements of this report 
noninterest income noninterest income increased in the year ending december   by million  or  to million as compared to million for the year most of the increase is from mortgage banking income including net gain on sales of mortgage loans  secondary market fees  and servicing income  which was million in  or an increase of million  or  from levels reflecting increases in sales of loans to investors 
trust income decreased by  in from million recorded in to million in the decrease in annual revenue was largely caused by three key client departures early in along with lower levels of new business development throughout the year 
discretionary assets under management were million and million at december  and  respectively 
substantially all of the decrease in discretionary assets in the trust department was attributable to the number of closed accounts and customers transfer of assets to other financial advisors

net realized gains on securities sales up  year over year also contributed to improved noninterest income for over noninterest expense noninterest expense totaled million in the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from million in the year ended december  salaries and benefits expense was million during the year ended december   which was a  increase from the prior year

net occupancy expense of million decreased  or  during compared with the million recorded in furniture and fixture expenses decreased by  to million in the year ended december  fdic costs decreased  or  for the year ended december   respectively  as compared to the same period of the prior year 
the methodology for the assessment calculation changed effective with the second quarter of the revised assessment approach applies to an adjusted average asset base rather than insured deposits 
the bank s reduced asset base contributed to the lower bank assessment 
in addition  the reduction in assets inherent in management s balance sheet strategy has also resulted in lower fdic premiums 
oreo expenses were flat in the year ended december  compared to the same period in there were decreases for the year to date period in insurance  taxes and general oreo expense 
professional and valuation expense increases offset these other decreases 
other noninterest expenses decreased  or  from approximately million in the year ended december  to approximately million in the same period of other expense decreases resulted primarily from the reduction of consulting and management fees  and collection expense 
income taxes the company did not record an income tax benefit for the year ended december   despite a  pre tax loss during that period  due to the establishment of a valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets which was first established as of december  under generally accepted accounting principles  income tax benefits and the related tax assets are only allowed to be recognized if they will more likely than not be fully realized 
as a result  at december   the net amount of the company s deferred tax assets related to operations has been reduced to zero 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ending december   and was the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgments concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including forecasts of future income  available tax planning strategies  and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
management considered both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of the deferred tax assets  which is largely dependent upon the ability to derive benefits based upon future taxable income 
management determined that realization of the deferred tax asset was not more likely than not as required by accounting principles and established a valuation allowance at december   to reflect this judgment 
a deferred tax asset related to accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from the net unrealized loss on available for sale securities decreased to  at december   from million at december  an increase in rates will generally cause a decrease in the fair value of individual securities and result in changes in unrealized loss on available for sale securities  while a decrease in rates generally causes an increase in fair value at a point in time 
in addition to the impact of rate changes upon pricing  uncertainty in the financial markets can cause reduced liquidity for certain investments and those changes are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements
