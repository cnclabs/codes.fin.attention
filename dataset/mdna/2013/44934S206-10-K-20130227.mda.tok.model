critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and obsolescence  intangible assets  goodwill  warrants  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 

table of contents additionally  the company uses assumptions and estimates in calculations to determine stock based compensation and the value of warrants 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  valuation of long lived and intangible assets  goodwill  warrants stock based compensation  income taxes 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue primarily from the sale of products and from the sale of services and supplies 
revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability of the related receivable is probable 
for product revenue  delivery has occurred upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
services and supplies revenue are considered to be delivered as the services are performed or over the estimated life of the supply agreement 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its digital  film based cad and ebx products and services in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc update no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu and asc update no 
 certain arrangements that contain software elements update no 

asu 
revenue for the sale of certain cad products is recognized in accordance with asc leases asc 
for multiple element arrangements  revenue is allocated to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
in such circumstances  a hierarchy is used to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price besp 
vsoe generally exists only when the deliverable is sold separately and is the price actually charged for that deliverable 
the process for determining besp for deliverables without vsoe or tpe considers multiple factors including relative selling prices  competitive prices in the marketplace  and management judgment  however  these may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each deliverable 
the company primarily uses customer purchase orders that are subject to the company s terms and conditions or  in the case of an original equipment manufacturer oem are governed by distribution agreements 
in accordance with our distribution agreements  the oem does not have a right of return  and title and risk of loss passes to the oem upon shipment 
the company 
table of contents generally ships free on board shipping point and uses shipping documents and third party proof of delivery to verify delivery and transfer of title 
in addition  the company assesses whether collection is probable by considering a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer  as obtained from third party credit references 
if the terms of the sale include customer acceptance provisions and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated  all revenue is deferred and not recognized until such acceptance occurs 
the company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  if any  and the installation process 
the company has determined that icad s digital  mri and film based sales generally follow the guidance of fasb asc topic revenue recognition asc as the software has been considered essential to the functionality of the product per the guidance of asu typically  the responsibility for the installation process lies with the oem partner 
on occasion  when icad is responsible for product installation  the installation element is considered a separate unit of accounting because the delivered product has stand alone value to the customer 
in these instances  the company allocates the deliverables based on the framework established within asu therefore  the installation and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed according to the vsoe of the element 
revenue from the digital  mri and film based equipment when there is installation is recognized based on the relative selling price allocation of the besp 
in prior years prior to asu  the company recognized the element on the residual method 
sales of the company s ebx product typically include a controller  accessories  and service and source agreements 
the company allocates revenue to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the besp in accordance with asu product revenue is generally recognized when the product has been delivered and service and source revenue is typically recognized over the life of the service and source agreement 
the company defers revenue from the sale of service contracts related to future periods and recognizes revenue on a straight line basis in accordance with asc topic  services 
the company provides for estimated warranty costs on original product warranties at the time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s policy is to maintain allowances for estimated losses from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial results  stability and payment history of each customer 
where appropriate  the company obtains credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying credit limits 
the company s senior management reviews accounts receivable on a periodic basis to determine if any receivables may potentially be uncollectible 
the company includes any accounts receivable balances that it determines may likely be uncollectible  along with a general reserve for estimated probable losses based on 
table of contents historical experience  in its overall allowance for doubtful accounts 
an amount would be written off against the allowance after all attempts to collect the receivable had failed 
based on the information available to the company  it believes the allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value  with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and or obsolete inventory primarily based upon historical usage of its inventory as well as other factors 
long lived assets long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the use of these assets 
when any such impairment exists  the related assets are written down to fair value 
intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of patents  technology intangibles  trade names  customer relationships and distribution agreements purchased in the company s previous acquisitions 
these assets are amortized on a straight line basis or the pattern of economic benefit over their estimated useful lives of to years 
goodwill in accordance with fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  asc  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events and circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of the company is less than the carrying value of the company 
the company operates in one segment and one reporting unit since operations are supported by one central staff and the results of operations are evaluated as one business unit 
in general the company s medical device products are similar in nature based on production  distribution  services provided and regulatory requirements 
the company uses market capitalization with a reasonable control premium market approach as the best evidence of fair value market capitalization is calculated using the quoted closing share price of the company s common stock multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding 
the company tests goodwill for impairment by comparing its market capitalization using the market approach to its carrying value at the same date as the basis to determine if a potential impairment exists 
the company also evaluates goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis the income approach to corroborate the market approach at its annual impairment testing date of october the company assesses the potential impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors the company considers important  which could trigger an impairment of such asset  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  
table of contents significant changes in the manner or use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in the company s market capitalization below net book value 
warrants in january  the company entered into several agreements with deerfield management  a healthcare investment fund deerfield  which included the issuance of warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  of which  shares of the company s common stock became immediately exercisable 
an additional  shares of common stock will become exercisable if the company elects to extend the debt as described in the agreements 
the company accounts for the warrants as debt in accordance with asc distinguishing liabilities from equity 
on a quarterly basis the company evaluates the fair value of warrants using a binomial lattice model 
inputs into the binomial lattice method include expected volatility  interest rate  and probabilities of a voluntary exercise of the warrants as well as the probability of major transaction ie company sale 
the inputs to determine the value of the warrants in the binomial lattice model require significant accounting judgment and estimates 
stock based compensation the company maintains stock based incentive plans  under which it provides stock incentives to employees  directors and contractors 
the company grants to employees  directors and contractors  restricted stock and or options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
the company follows fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  for all stock based compensation 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of its common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amounts recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes the company follows the liability method under fasb asc topic  income taxes asc 
the primary objectives of accounting for taxes under asc are to a recognize the amount of tax payable for the current year and b recognize the amount of deferred tax liability

asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  disclosure and transition 
in addition  uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination are initially estimated as of the acquisition date and the company revaluates these items quarterly  with any adjustments to preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill  provided that the company is within the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date and continues to collect information in order to determine their estimated values 
subsequent to the measurement period or final determination of the tax allowance s or contingency s estimated value  changes to these uncertain tax positions and tax related valuation allowances may affect the provision for income taxes presented in the company s statement of operations
