critical accounting policies and estimates the company has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified five policies  that as a result of judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of the company consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the methodology for the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of mortgage servicing rights msrs  the determination of other than temporary impairments in the market value of investment securities  the determination of goodwill impairment and the determination of the recorded value of other real estate owned 
these policies and the judgments  estimates and assumptions are described in greater detail in subsequent sections of management discussion and analysis contained herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in particular  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  generally describes the company accounting policies 
management believes that the judgments  estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the company consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time 
however  given the sensitivity of the company consolidated financial statements to these critical policies  the use of other judgments  estimates and assumptions could result in material differences in the company results of operations or financial condition 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the portfolio 
the allowance is based upon management comprehensive analysis of the pertinent factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio 
these factors include changes in the amount and composition of the loan portfolio  delinquency levels  actual loan loss experience  current economic conditions  and detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectibility may not be assured 
the detailed analysis includes methods to estimate the fair value of loan collateral and the existence of potential alternative sources of repayment 
the appropriate allowance for loan loss level is estimated based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
while the company believes it has established its existing allowance for loan losses in accordance with gaap  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing the company s loan portfolio  will not request the company to significantly increase or decrease its allowance for loan losses 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that substantial increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed elsewhere in this document 
although management believes the level of the allowance as of september  was adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  a decline in local economic conditions  results of examinations by the company s or the bank s regulators or other factors  could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses and may adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
mortgage servicing rights 
msrs are capitalized when acquired through the origination of loans that are subsequently sold with servicing rights retained and are amortized to servicing income on loans sold in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income 
the value of msrs at the date of the sale of loans is determined based on the discounted present value of expected future cash flows using key assumptions for servicing income and costs and prepayment rates on the underlying loans 
the estimated fair value is evaluated at least annually by a third party firm for impairment by comparing actual cash flows and estimated cash flows from the servicing assets to those estimated at the time servicing assets were originated 
the effect of changes in market interest rates on estimated rates of loan prepayments represents the predominant risk characteristic underlying the msrs portfolio 
the company methodology for estimating the fair value of msrs is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
for example  the determination of fair value uses anticipated prepayment speeds 
actual prepayment experience may differ and any difference may have a material effect on the fair value 
thus  any measurement of msrs fair value is limited by the conditions existing and assumptions as of the date made 
those assumptions may not be appropriate if they are applied at different times 
other than temporary impairment otti in the estimated fair value of investment securities 
unrealized investment securities losses on available for sale and held to maturity securities are evaluated at least quarterly by a third party firm to determine whether declines in value should be considered other than temporary and therefore be subject to immediate loss recognition through earnings for the portion related to credit losses 
although these evaluations involve significant judgment  an unrealized loss in the fair value of a debt security is generally deemed to be temporary when the fair value of the security is less than the recorded value primarily as a result of changes in interest rates  when there has not been significant deterioration in the financial condition of the issuer  and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
an unrealized loss in the value of an equity security is generally considered temporary when the fair value of the security is below the recorded value primarily as a result of current market conditions and not a result of deterioration in the financial condition of the underlying borrowers or the underlying collateral in the case of mutual funds and the company has the intent and the ability to hold the security for a sufficient time to recover the recorded value 
other factors that may be considered in determining whether a decline in the value of either a debt or equity security is other than temporary include ratings by recognized rating agencies  capital strength and near term prospects of the issuer  and recommendation of investment advisors or market analysts 
therefore  continued deterioration of current market conditions could result in additional impairment losses recognized within the company s investment portfolio 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite useful life and is analyzed annually for impairment 
an annual test is performed during the third quarter of each fiscal year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the recorded goodwill is impaired 
if the estimated fair value of the company sole reporting unit exceeds the recorded value of the reporting unit  goodwill is not considered impaired 
the goodwill impairment tests involves a two step process 
step one of the goodwill impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting unit utilizing the allocation of corporate value approach  the income approach and the market approach in order to derive an enterprise value for the company 
if the results of the company step one test indicate that the reporting unit estimated fair value is less than its recorded value  a step two analysis is performed 
in the step two analysis  the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities is calculated in order to determine the implied fair value of the company goodwill 
if the implied value of the goodwill exceeds the recorded value of goodwill  then goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of goodwill impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others  a significant decline in the expected future cash flows  a sustained  significant decline in the company stock price and market capitalization  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  adverse assessment or action by a regulator  and unanticipated competition 
key assumptions used in the annual goodwill impairment test are highly judgmental and include selection of comparable companies  amount of control premium  projected cash flows  discount rate applied to projected cash flows and method of estimating the fair value of loans 
any change in these indicators or key assumptions could have a significant negative impact on the company financial condition  impact the goodwill impairment analysis or cause the company to perform a goodwill impairment analysis more frequently than once per year 
during the quarter ended june   the company engaged a third party firm specializing in goodwill impairment valuations for financial institutions to help perform the annual test for goodwill impairment 
the test concluded that recorded goodwill was not impaired 
as of september   there have been no events or changes in the circumstances that would indicate a potential impairment 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future 
other real estate owned oreo and other repossessed assets 
oreo and other repossessed assets consist of properties or assets acquired through or in lieu of foreclosure  and are recorded initially at the estimated fair value of the properties less estimated costs of disposal 
costs relating to development and improvement of the properties or assets are capitalized while costs relating to holding the properties or assets are expensed 
valuations are periodically performed by management  and a charge to earnings is recorded if the recorded value of a property exceeds its estimated net realizable value
