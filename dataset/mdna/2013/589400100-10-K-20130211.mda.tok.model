item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for the years through  the company experienced unfavorable development of approximately million to million on prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the unfavorable development was primarily due to increases in the estimated loss severity for accident years through california bi losses  increases in pip reserves in florida resulting from court decisions that were adverse to the insurance industry  and development on and prior accident years new jersey bi reserves that settled for more than anticipated 
these were partially offset by reductions in estimates for loss adjustment expenses  particularly for the accident year  related to the transfer of a higher proportion of litigated claims to house counsel and a reduction in the estimate for florida sinkhole claims for accident year  resulting from many of those claims being denied due to the absence of sinkhole activity or structural damage to the houses 

table of contents for the years through  the company experienced unfavorable development of approximately million to million on prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the unfavorable development from these years related primarily to increases in loss severity estimates and loss adjustment expense estimates for the california bi coverage as well as increases in the provision for losses in new jersey and florida 
for  the unfavorable development related to an increase in the company s prior accident years loss estimates for personal automobile insurance in florida and new jersey 
in addition  an increase in estimates for loss severity for the accident year reserves for california and new jersey automobile lines of business contributed to the deficiencies 
for  the favorable development largely related to lower inflation than originally expected on the bi coverage reserves for the california automobile line of insurance 
in addition  the company experienced a reduction in expenditures to outside legal counsel for the defense of personal automobile claims in california 
this led to a reduction in the ultimate expense amount expected to be paid out and therefore favorable development in the reserves at december   partially offset by unfavorable development in the florida automobile lines of business 
for  the unfavorable development related to increases in the ultimate liability for bi  physical damage  and collision claims over what was originally estimated 
the increases in these losses related to increased severity over what was originally recorded and were the result of inflationary trends in health care  auto parts  and body shop labor costs 
statutory accounting principles the company s results are reported in accordance with gaap  which differ in some respects from amounts reported under sap prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities 
some of the significant differences under gaap are described below policy acquisition costs such as commissions  premium taxes  and other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the successful acquisition of new and renewal insurance contracts  are capitalized and amortized on a pro rata basis over the period in which the related premiums are earned  rather than expensed as incurred  as required by sap 
certain assets are included in the consolidated balance sheets whereas  under sap  such assets are designated as nonadmitted assets  and charged directly against statutory surplus 
these assets consist primarily of premium receivables outstanding more than days  deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition  furniture  equipment  leasehold improvements  capitalized software  and prepaid expenses 
amounts related to ceded reinsurance are shown gross as prepaid reinsurance premiums and reinsurance recoverables  rather than netted against unearned premium reserves and losses and loss adjustment expenses reserves  respectively  as required by sap 
fixed maturity securities are reported at fair value rather than at amortized cost  or the lower of amortized cost or fair value  depending on the specific type of security as required by sap 
goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the underlying assets and assessed periodically for impairment 
intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives 
under sap  goodwill is reported as the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the statutory book value and amortized over years 
its carrying value is limited to of adjusted surplus 
intangible assets are not recognized 
the differing treatment of income and expense items results in a corresponding difference in federal income tax expense 
changes in deferred income taxes are reflected as an item of income tax benefit or expense  rather than recorded directly to statutory surplus as regards policyholders  as required by sap 
admittance testing under sap may result in a charge to unassigned surplus for non admitted portions of deferred tax assets 
under gaap  a valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets and reflected as an expense 
certain assessments paid to regulatory agencies that are recoverable from policyholders in future periods are expensed rather than recorded as receivables under sap 
operating ratios sap basis loss and expense ratios loss and expense ratios are used to interpret the underwriting experience of property and casualty insurance companies 
under sap  losses and loss adjustment expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums earned because losses occur over the life of a policy  while underwriting expenses are stated as a percentage of premiums written rather than premiums earned because most underwriting expenses are incurred when policies are written and are not spread over the policy period 
the statutory 
table of contents underwriting profit margin is the extent to which the combined loss and expense ratios are less than 
the insurance companies loss ratio  expense ratio  combined ratio  and the private passenger automobile industry combined ratio  on a statutory basis  are shown in the following table 
the insurance companies ratios include lines of insurance other than private passenger automobile 
since these other lines represent only of premiums written  the company believes its ratios can be compared to the industry ratios included in the following table

the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
the investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified  investment grade  fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve a return on capital and profitable growth 
the company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults 
the company believes that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time 
the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  liquid and credit assets as well as for monitoring credit exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions 
tax considerations  including the impact of the alternative minimum tax amt  are important in portfolio management 
changes in loss experience  growth rates  and profitability produce significant changes in the company s exposure to amt liability  requiring appropriate shifts in the investment asset mix between taxable bonds  tax exempt bonds  and equities in order to maximize after tax yield 
the company closely monitors the timing and recognition of capital gains and losses to maximize the realization of any deferred tax assets arising from capital losses 
the company had no capital loss carryforward at december

at december   of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt state and municipal bonds 
for more detailed information including credit ratings  see liquidity and capital resources portfolio composition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the nominal average maturity of the overall bond portfolio was years years including all short term instruments at december   and is heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds 
fixed maturity investments purchased by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the call adjusted average maturity of the overall bond portfolio was years years including all short term instruments related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified duration of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years years including all short term instruments at december   including collateralized mortgage obligations with a modified duration of years and short term bonds that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
as it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield  and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
equity holdings consist of non redeemable preferred stocks  common stocks on which dividend income is partially tax sheltered by the corporate dividend received deduction  and a partnership interest in a private credit fund 
at year end  of short term investments consisted of highly rated short duration securities redeemable on a daily or weekly basis 
the company does not have any direct equity investment in subprime lenders 

table of contents investment results the following table presents the investment results of the company for the most recent five years year ended december  amounts in thousands average invested assets at cost net investment income before income taxes after income taxes average annual yield on investments before income taxes after income taxes net realized investment gains losses after income taxes fixed maturities and short term bonds at amortized cost  and equities and other short term investments at cost 
average invested assets at cost is based on the monthly amortized cost of the invested assets for each respective period 
net investment income and average annual yield decreased primarily due to the maturity and replacement of higher yielding investments  purchased when market interest rates were higher  with lower yielding investments purchased during the current low interest rate environment 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value option with changes in fair value reflected in net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
competitive conditions the company operates in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance industry subject to competition on pricing  claims handling  consumer recognition  coverage offered and other product features  customer service  and geographic coverage 
some of the company s competitors are larger and well capitalized national companies which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents 
reputation for customer service and price are the principal means by which the company competes with other automobile insurers 
in addition  the marketing efforts of independent agents can provide a competitive advantage 
based on the most recent regularly published statistical compilations of premiums written in  the company was the fifth largest writer of private passenger automobile insurance in california and the thirteenth largest in the united states 
the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with alternating hard and soft market conditions 
the company has historically seen significant premium growth during hard markets 
the company believes that the market may be hardening as growth has begun to improve throughout reinsurance the company has reinsurance through the florida hurricane catastrophe trust fund fhcf that provides coverage equal to approximately percent of million in excess of million per occurrence based on the latest information provided by fhcf 
as of december   the company no longer has any florida homeowners policies in force and will not be renewing fhcf coverage in the company has reinsurance for pip claims in michigan through the michigan catastrophic claims association  a private non profit unincorporated association created by the michigan legislature in the reinsurance covers losses in excess of  per person and has no maximum limit 
michigan law provides for unlimited lifetime coverage for medical costs caused by automobile accidents 
for california homeowners policies  the company has reduced its catastrophe exposure from earthquakes by placing earthquake risks directly with the california earthquake authority cea 
however  the company continues to have catastrophe exposure to fires following an earthquake 
for more detailed discussion  see regulation insurance assessments 

table of contents the company carries a commercial umbrella reinsurance treaty and seeks facultative arrangements for large property risks 
in addition  the company has other reinsurance in force that is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
if any reinsurers are unable to perform their obligations under a reinsurance treaty  the company will be required  as primary insurer  to discharge all obligations to its policyholders in their entirety 
regulation the insurance companies are subject to significant regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to operate business 
department of insurance oversight the powers of the doi in each state primarily include the prior approval of insurance rates and rating factors and the establishment of capital and surplus requirements  solvency standards  restrictions on dividend payments and transactions with affiliates 
doi regulations and supervision are designed principally to benefit policyholders rather than shareholders 
california proposition requires that property and casualty insurance rates be approved by the california doi prior to their use and that no rate be approved which is excessive  inadequate  unfairly discriminatory  or otherwise in violation of the provisions of the initiative 
the proposition specifies four statutory factors required to be applied in decreasing order of importance in determining rates for private passenger automobile insurance the insured s driving safety record  the number of miles the insured drives annually  the number of years of driving experience of the insured and whatever optional factors are determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to risk of loss and are adopted by regulation 
the statute further provides that insurers are required to give at least a discount to good drivers  as defined  from rates that would otherwise be charged to such drivers and that no insurer may refuse to insure a good driver 
the company s rate plan operates under these rating factor regulations 
on october   the company implemented the california doi approved rate increase of approximately on california private passenger automobile policies 
the rate increase has not had a significant impact on the number of new and renewal policies written 
in october  the company filed for a rate increase in caic private passenger automobile line of business  and plans to file for a rate increase in mic private passenger automobile line of business 
the company must obtain approval from the california doi before implementing these new rates 
in may  the company filed for a rate increase for its california homeowners line of business 
in may  the matter was referred to an administrative law judge for review 
after extensive evidentiary hearings  the administrative law judge delivered a proposed decision on the matter to the california insurance commissioner in september that recommended a rate reduction of approximately 
on october   the company received notice from the california insurance commissioner rejecting the administrative law judge proposed decision and referred the matter back to the administrative law judge to gather more evidence 
however  the california insurance commissioner recently issued a ruling to disregard his order to gather more evidence 
the company expects a final ruling from the california insurance commissioner on this matter in the near future 
the company does not agree with the proposed rate decrease and believes that recent homeowners loss trends support an increase 
consequently  the company recently filed for a rate increase of 
insurance rates in georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  and nevada require prior approval from the state doi  while insurance rates in illinois  texas  virginia  arizona  and michigan must only be filed with the respective doi before they are implemented 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate  or unfairly discriminatory 
the doi in each state in which the company operates is responsible for conducting periodic financial and market conduct examinations of the insurance companies in their states 
market conduct examinations typically review compliance with insurance statutes and regulations with respect to rating  underwriting  claims handling  billing  and other practices 
the following table presents a summary of current financial and market conduct examinations state exam type period under review status nv market conduct january to december doi terminated exam 
no report to be issued 
during the course of and at the conclusion of these examinations  the examining doi generally reports findings to the company  and none of the findings reported to date is expected to be material to the company s financial position 

table of contents for a discussion of current regulatory matters in california  see regulatory and legal matters in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the operations of the company are dependent on the laws of the states in which it does business and changes in those laws can materially affect the revenue and expenses of the company 
the company retains its own legislative advocates in california 
the company made direct financial contributions of  and  to officeholders and candidates in and  respectively 
the company believes in supporting the political process and intends to continue to make such contributions in amounts which it determines to be appropriate 
risk based capital the insurance companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premiums  a percentage of annualized loss  or risk based capital rbc requirements 
the rbc formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements  and a number of other factors 
at december   each of the insurance companies had sufficient capital to exceed the highest level of minimum required capital 
insurance assessments the california insurance guarantee association ciga was created to pay claims on behalf of insolvent property and casualty insurers 
each year  these claims are estimated by ciga and the company is assessed for its pro rata share based on prior year california premiums written in the particular line 
these assessments are limited to of premiums written in the preceding year and are recouped through a mandated surcharge to policyholders in the year after the assessment 
there were no ciga assessments in during  the company paid approximately million in assessments to the new jersey unsatisfied claim and judgment fund and the new jersey property liability insurance guaranty association for assessments relating to its personal automobile line of insurance 
as permitted by state law  the new jersey assessments paid during are recoupable through a surcharge to policyholders 
the company recouped a portion of these assessments in and expects to continue to recoup them in the future 
it is likely that there will be additional assessments in the cea is a quasi governmental organization that was established to provide a market for earthquake coverage to california homeowners 
the company places all new and renewal earthquake coverage offered with its homeowner policy directly with the cea 
the company receives a small fee for placing business with the cea  which is recorded as other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
upon the occurrence of a major seismic event  the cea has the ability to assess participating companies for losses 
these assessments are made after cea capital has been expended and are based upon each company s participation percentage multiplied by the amount of the total assessment 
based upon the most recent information provided by the cea  the company s maximum total exposure to cea assessments at april   the most recent date at which information was available  was million 
there was no assessment made in the insurance companies in other states are also subject to the provisions of similar insurance guaranty associations 
there were no material assessment payments during in other states 
holding company act the california companies are subject to california doi regulation pursuant to the provisions of the california insurance holding company system regulatory act the holding company act 
the california doi may examine the affairs of each of the california companies at any time 
the holding company act requires disclosure of any material transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
some transactions and dividends defined to be of an extraordinary type may not be made if the california doi disapproves the transaction within days after notice 
such transactions include  but are not limited to  extraordinary dividends  management agreements  service contracts  and cost sharing arrangements  all guarantees that are not quantifiable  derivative transactions or series of derivative transactions  certain reinsurance transactions or modifications thereof in which the reinsurance premium or a change in the insurer s liabilities equals or exceeds percent of the policyholders surplus as of the preceding december  sales  purchases  exchanges  loans  and extensions of credit  and investments  in the net aggregate  involving more than the lesser of of the respective california companies admitted assets or of statutory surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december an extraordinary dividend is a dividend which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s statutory policyholders surplus as of the preceding december or the insurance company s statutory net income for the preceding calendar year 

table of contents an insurance company is also required to notify the california doi of any dividend after declaration  but prior to payment 
there are similar limitations imposed by other states on the insurance companies ability to pay dividends 
as of december   the insurance companies are permitted to pay in  without obtaining doi approval for extraordinary dividends  million in dividends to mercury general  of which million is payable from the california companies 
the holding company act also provides that the acquisition or change of control of a california domiciled insurance company or of any person who controls such an insurance company cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the california doi 
in general  a presumption of control arises from the ownership of voting securities and securities that are convertible into voting securities  which in the aggregate constitute or more of the voting securities of a california insurance company or of a person that controls a california insurance company  such as mercury general 
a person seeking to acquire control  directly or indirectly  of the company must generally file with the california doi an application for change of control containing certain information required by statute and published regulations and provide a copy of the application to the company 
the holding company act also effectively restricts the company from consummating certain reorganizations or mergers without prior regulatory approval 
each of the insurance companies is subject to holding company regulations in the state in which it is domiciled 
these provisions are substantially similar to those of the holding company act 
assigned risks automobile liability insurers in california are required to sell bi liability  property damage liability  medical expense  and uninsured motorist coverage to a proportionate number based on the insurer s share of the california automobile casualty insurance market of those drivers applying for placement as assigned risks 
drivers seek placement as assigned risks because their driving records or other relevant characteristics  as defined by proposition  make them difficult to insure in the voluntary market 
in  assigned risks represented less than of total automobile direct premiums written and less than of total automobile direct premium earned 
the company attributes the low level of assignments to the competitive voluntary market 
many of the other states in which the company conducts business offer programs similar to that of california 
these programs are not a significant contributor to the business written in those states

risk factors the company s business involves various risks and uncertainties in addition to the normal risks of business  some of which are discussed in this section 
it should be noted that the company s business and that of other insurers may be adversely affected by a downturn in general economic conditions and other forces beyond the company s control 
in addition  other risks and uncertainties not presently known or that the company currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the company s business 
if any such risks or uncertainties  or any of the following risks or uncertainties  develop into actual events  there could be a materially adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
the information discussed below should be considered carefully with the other information contained in this annual report on form k and the other documents and materials filed by the company with the sec  as well as news releases and other information publicly disseminated by the company from time to time 

table of contents risks related to the company s business the company remains highly dependent upon california and several other key states to produce revenues and operating profits 
for the year ended december   the company generated of its direct automobile insurance premiums written in california  in florida  in new jersey  and in texas 
the company s financial results are subject to prevailing regulatory  legal  economic  demographic  competitive  and other conditions in these states and changes in any of these conditions could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
mercury general is a holding company that relies on regulated subsidiaries for cash operating profits to satisfy its obligations 
as a holding company  mercury general maintains no operations that generate revenue sufficient to pay operating expenses  shareholders dividends  or principal or interest on its indebtedness 
consequently  mercury general relies on the ability of the insurance companies  particularly the california companies  to pay dividends for mercury general to meet its obligations 
the ability of the insurance companies to pay dividends is regulated by state insurance laws  which limit the amount of  and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of  cash dividends 
generally  these insurance regulations permit the payment of dividends only out of earned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the inability of the insurance companies to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to enable the company to meet its cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition  and its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to minimum capital and surplus requirements  and any failure to meet these requirements could subject the company s insurance subsidiaries to regulatory action 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital standards and other minimum capital and surplus requirements imposed under applicable laws of their state of domicile 
the risk based capital standards  based upon the risk based capital model act adopted by the naic  require the company s insurance subsidiaries to report their results of rbc calculations to state departments of insurance and the naic 
if any of the company s insurance subsidiaries fails to meet these standards and requirements  the doi regulating such subsidiary may require specified actions by the subsidiary 
the company s success depends on its ability to accurately underwrite risks and to charge adequate premiums to policyholders 
the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity depend on its ability to underwrite and set premiums accurately for the risks it assumes 
premium rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset losses  loss adjustment expenses  and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 
in order to price its products accurately  the company must collect and properly analyze a substantial volume of data  develop  test  and apply appropriate rating formulae  closely monitor and timely recognize changes in trends  and project both severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy 
the company s ability to undertake these efforts successfully  and as a result  price accurately  is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to availability of sufficient reliable data  incorrect or incomplete analysis of available data  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  successful innovation of new pricing strategies  recognition of changes in trends and in the projected severity and frequency of losses  the company s ability to forecast renewals of existing policies accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in the company s claim settlement practices  changes in operating expenses  changing driving patterns  
table of contents extra contractual liability arising from bad faith claims  weather catastrophes  including those which may be related to climate change  losses from sinkhole claims  unexpected medical inflation  and unanticipated inflation in auto repair costs  auto parts prices  and used car prices 
such risks may result in the company s pricing being based on outdated  inadequate or inaccurate data  or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause the company to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  the company could underprice risks  which would negatively affect the company s margins  or it could overprice risks  which could reduce the company s volume and competitiveness 
in either event  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the company s business are uncertain and may have an adverse effect on the company s business 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the company s business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until sometime after the company has issued insurance policies that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under the company s insurance policies may not be known for many years after a policy is issued 
the company s insurance rates are subject to prior approval by the departments of insurance in most of the states in which the company operates  and to political influences 
in most of the states in which it operates  the company must obtain the doi prior approval of insurance rates charged to its customers  including any increases in those rates 
if the company is unable to receive approval of the rate changes it requests  or if such approval is delayed  the company s ability to operate its business in a profitable manner may be limited and its financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity may be adversely affected 
additionally  in california  the law allows for consumer groups to intervene in rate filings which frequently causes delays in the timeliness of rate approvals and can impact the level of rate that is ultimately approved 
from time to time  the auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators  legislators  and special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs  in the opinion of the company s management 
the homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure  particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states seek an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure 
in addition  various insurance underwriting and pricing criteria regularly come under attack by regulators  legislators  and special interest groups 
the result could be legislation  regulations  or new interpretations of existing regulations that would adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
loss of  or significant restriction on  the use of credit scoring in the pricing and underwriting of personal lines products could reduce the company s future profitability 
the company uses credit scoring as a factor in pricing and underwriting decisions where allowed by state law 
some consumer groups and regulators have questioned whether the use of credit scoring unfairly discriminates against some groups of people and are calling to prohibit or restrict the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing 
laws or regulations that significantly curtail or regulate the use of credit scoring  if enacted in a large number of states in which the company operates  could impact the company s future results of operations 
if the company cannot maintain its am best ratings  it may not be able to maintain premium volume in its insurance operations sufficient to attain the company s financial performance goals 
the company s ability to retain its existing business or to attract new business in its insurance operations is affected by its rating by am best company 
am best company currently rates all of the company s insurance subsidiaries with sufficient operating history to be rated as either a superior or a excellent 
if the company is unable to maintain its am best ratings  the company may not be able to grow its premium volume sufficiently to attain its financial performance goals  and if am best were to downgrade the company s ratings  the result may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents the company may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
the company s future capital requirements depend on many factors  including its ability to underwrite new business successfully  its ability to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses  the success of its current expansion plans and the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company may need to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing  sales of all or a portion of its investment portfolio or curtail its growth and reduce its assets 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may not be available on terms that are favorable to the company 
in the case of equity financing  the company s shareholders could experience dilution 
in addition  such securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges that are senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
if the company cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all  its business  financial condition  and results of operations could be adversely affected 
funding for the company s future growth may depend upon obtaining new financing  which may be difficult to obtain given prevalent economic conditions 
to accommodate the company s expected future growth  the company may require funding in addition to cash provided from current operations 
the company s ability to obtain financing may be constrained by current economic conditions affecting global financial markets 
specifically  with the recent trends affecting the banking industry  many lenders and institutional investors have ceased funding even the most credit worthy borrowers 
in addition  financial strength and claims paying ability ratings have become an increasingly important factor in the company s ability to access capital markets 
rating agencies assign ratings based upon an evaluation of an insurance company s ability to meet its financial obligations 
the company s current financial strength rating with fitch is a 
if the company were to seek financing through the capital markets in the future  it may need to apply for standard and poor s and moody s ratings 
the ratings could limit the company s access to the capital markets or adversely affect pricing of new debt sought in the capital markets 
if the company is unable to obtain necessary financing  it may be unable to take advantage of opportunities with potential business partners or new products or to otherwise expand its business as planned 
changes in market interest rates or defaults may have an adverse effect on the company s investment portfolio  which may adversely affect the company s financial results 
the company s results are affected  in part  by the performance of its investment portfolio 
the company s investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive investments  such as municipal and corporate bonds 
increases in market interest rates may have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing the value of fixed income securities 
declining market interest rates could have an adverse impact on the company s investment income as it invests positive cash flows from operations and as it reinvests proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could yield lower rates than the company s investments have historically generated 
defaults in the company s investment portfolio may produce operating losses and negatively impact the company s results of operations 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the company s control 
although the company takes measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  it may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
the company s mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio and managing the duration of the portfolio to reduce the effect of interest rate changes 
despite its mitigation efforts  a significant change in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s valuation of financial instruments may include methodologies  estimations  and assumptions that are subject to differing interpretations and could result in changes to valuations that may materially adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date using the exit price 
accordingly  when market observable data are not readily available  the company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that market participants would be presumed to use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
assets and liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with the input used to measure their fair value and the level of market price observability 
during periods of market disruption  including periods of significantly changing interest rates  rapidly widening credit spreads  inactivity or illiquidity  it may be difficult to value certain of the company s securities if trading becomes less frequent and or market data become less observable 
there may be certain asset classes in historically active markets with significant observable data that become illiquid due to changes in the financial environment 
in such cases  the valuations associated with 
table of contents such securities may rely more on management judgment and include inputs and assumptions that are less observable or require greater estimation as well as valuation methods  which are more sophisticated or require greater estimation 
the valuations generated by such methods may be different from the value at which the investments ultimately may be sold 
further  rapidly changing and unprecedented credit and equity market conditions could materially impact the valuation of securities as reported within the company s consolidated financial statements  and the period to period changes in value could vary significantly 
decreases in value may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
changes in the financial strength ratings of financial guaranty insurers issuing policies on bonds held in the company s investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on the company s investment results 
in an effort to enhance the bond rating applicable to certain bond issues  some bond issuers purchase municipal bond insurance policies from private insurers 
the insurance generally guarantees the payment of principal and interest on a bond issue if the issuer defaults 
by purchasing the insurance  the financial strength ratings applicable to the bonds are based on the credit worthiness of the insurer as well as the underlying credit of the bond issuer 
several financial guaranty insurers that have issued insurance policies covering bonds held by the company have experienced financial strength rating downgrades due to risk exposures on insurance policies that guarantee mortgage debt and related structured products 
these financial guaranty insurers are subject to doi oversight 
as the financial strength ratings of these insurers are reduced  the ratings of the insured bond issues correspondingly decrease 
although the company has determined that the financial strength rating of the underlying bond issues in its investment portfolio are within the company s investment policy without the enhancement provided by the insurance policies  any further downgrades in the financial strength ratings of these insurance companies or any defaults on the insurance policies written by these insurance companies may reduce the fair value of the underlying bond issues and the company s investment portfolio or may reduce the investment results generated by the company s investment portfolio  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
deterioration of the municipal bond market in general or of specific municipal bonds held by the company may result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
at december   of the company s total investment portfolio at fair value and of its total fixed maturity investments at fair value were invested in tax exempt municipal bonds 
with such a large percentage of the company s investment portfolio invested in municipal bonds  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  including the cash flows generated by the investment portfolio is significantly dependent on the performance of municipal bonds 
if the value of municipal bond markets in general or any of the company s municipal bond holdings deteriorate  the performance of the company s investment portfolio  financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity may be materially and adversely affected 
adoption of proposed changes in the tax exemption available for municipal bond interest will have an adverse effect on the value of the company municipal bond portfolio and the investment income generated by the company 
proposals have been made for the elimination or modification of the tax exempt status or tax rates applicable to municipal bonds as part of significant tax reform being considered  some of which would enact such changes retroactively 
because many states adopt changes in the internal revenue code as a part of the state taxation system  such changes to the federal income and or capital gains laws may result in changes to state tax laws  resulting in a loss of or reduction in the exemption of municipal bond interest for state income tax purposes as well 
any changes in tax rates or the tax exempt status applicable to municipal bonds actually adopted could significantly affect the demand for and supply of liquidity and marketability of such municipal bond obligations 
such changes would likely result in a decrease in the value of the company municipal bond portfolio and limit the ability of the company to acquire and dispose of municipal obligations at desirable yield and price levels 
such changes may also materially reduce the after tax income earned by the company investment securities 
if the company s loss reserves are inadequate  its business and financial position could be harmed 
the process of establishing property and liability loss reserves is inherently uncertain due to a number of factors  including underwriting quality  the frequency and amount of covered losses  variations in claims settlement practices  the costs and uncertainty of litigation  and expanding theories of liability 
while the company believes that its actuarial techniques and databases are sufficient to estimate loss reserves  the company s approach may prove to be inadequate 
if any of these contingencies  many of which are beyond the company s control  results in loss reserves that are not sufficient to cover its actual losses  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
there is uncertainty involved in the availability of reinsurance and the collectability of reinsurance recoverable 
the company reinsures a portion of its potential losses on the policies it issues to mitigate the volatility of the losses on its financial condition and results of operations 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to market conditions  which are outside of the company s control 
from time to time  market conditions have limited  and in some cases prevented  insurers from 
table of contents obtaining the types and amounts of reinsurance that they consider adequate for their business needs 
as a result  the company may not be able to successfully purchase reinsurance and transfer a portion of the company s risk through reinsurance arrangements 
in addition  as is customary  the company initially pays all claims and seeks to recover the reinsured losses from its reinsurers 
although the company reports as assets the amount of claims paid which the company expects to recover from reinsurers  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to collect from its reinsurers 
if the amounts actually recoverable under the company s reinsurance treaties are ultimately determined to be less than the amount it has reported as recoverable  the company may incur a loss during the period in which that determination is made 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods employed by the company could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
various provisions of the company s policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage which are intended to limit the company s risks  may not be enforceable in the manner the company intends 
in addition  the company s policies contain conditions requiring the prompt reporting of claims and the company s right to decline coverage in the event of a violation of that condition 
while the company s insurance product exclusions and limitations reduce the company s loss exposure and help eliminate known exposures to certain risks  it is possible that a court or regulatory authority could nullify or void an exclusion or legislation could be enacted modifying or barring the use of such endorsements and limitations in a way that would adversely affect the company s loss experience  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss  which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters  man made catastrophes and other catastrophic events  particularly hurricanes  earthquakes  hail storms  explosions  tropical storms  fires  sinkholes  war  acts of terrorism  severe winter weather and other natural and man made disasters 
such events typically increase the frequency and severity of automobile and other property claims 
because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable  historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations  and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in substantial volatility in the company s financial condition and results of operations from period to period 
although the company attempts to manage its exposure to such events  the occurrence of one or more major catastrophes in any given period could have a material and adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations and could result in substantial outflows of cash as losses are paid 
the company depends on independent agents who may discontinue sales of its policies at any time 
the company sells its insurance policies through approximately  independent agents 
the company must compete with other insurance carriers for these agents business 
some competitors offer a larger variety of products  lower prices for insurance coverage  higher commissions  or more attractive non cash incentives 
to maintain its relationship with these independent agents  the company must pay competitive commissions  be able to respond to their needs quickly and adequately  and create a consistently high level of customer satisfaction 
if these independent agents find it preferable to do business with the company s competitors  it would be difficult to renew the company s existing business or attract new business 
state regulations may also limit the manner in which the company s producers are compensated or incentivized 
such developments could negatively impact the company s relationship with these parties and ultimately reduce revenues 
the company s expansion plans may adversely affect its future profitability 
the company intends to continue to expand its operations in several of the states in which the company has operations and into states in which it has not yet begun operations 
the intended expansion will necessitate increased expenditures 
the company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flow from operations 
the expansion may not occur  or if it does occur  may not be successful in providing increased revenues or profitability 
if the company s cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover the increased costs of the expansion  or if the expansion does not provide the benefits anticipated  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and ability to grow its business may be harmed 
any inability of the company to realize its deferred tax assets may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences related to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and for tax credits 
the company evaluates its deferred tax assets for recoverability based on available evidence  including assumptions about future profitability and capital gain generation 
although management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized  some or all of the company s deferred tax assets could expire unused if the company is unable to generate taxable income of an appropriate character and in a sufficient amount to utilize these tax benefits in the future 

table of contents if the company determines that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce the deferred tax asset through a charge to earnings in the period in which the determination is made 
this charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the assumptions used to make this determination are subject to change from period to period based on changes in tax laws or variances between the company s projected operating performance and actual results 
as a result  significant management judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
for these reasons and because changes in these assumptions and estimates can materially affect the company s results of operations and financial condition  management has included the assessment of a deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a critical accounting estimate 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets could be subject to an impairment write down 
at december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected approximately million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
the company evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that suggest that the fair values of its intangible assets are below their respective carrying values 
the determination that the fair value of the company s intangible assets is less than its carrying value may result in an impairment write down 
the impairment write down would be reflected as expense and could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations during the period in which it recognizes the expense 
in the future  the company may incur impairment charges related to the goodwill and other intangible assets already recorded or arising out of future acquisitions 
the company relies on its information technology systems to manage many aspects of its business  and any failure of these systems to function properly or any interruption in their operation could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company depends on the accuracy  reliability  and proper functioning of its information technology systems 
the company relies on these information technology systems to effectively manage many aspects of its business  including underwriting  policy acquisition  claims processing and handling  accounting  reserving and actuarial processes and policies  and to maintain its policyholder data 
the company is developing and deploying new information technology systems that are designed to manage many of these functions across all of the states in which it operates and all of the lines of insurance it offers 
see overview technology in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the failure of hardware or software that supports the company s information technology systems  the loss of data contained in the systems  or any delay or failure in the full deployment of the company s new information technology systems could disrupt its business and could result in decreased premiums  increased overhead costs  and inaccurate reporting  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
in addition  despite system redundancy  the implementation of security measures  and the existence of a disaster recovery plan for the company s information technology systems  these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquake  fire  flood and other natural disasters  terrorist attacks and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power loss  unauthorized access  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
it is possible that a system failure  accident  or security breach could result in a material disruption to the company s business 
in addition  substantial costs may be incurred to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions 
following implementation of its new information technology systems  the company may from time to time install new or upgraded business management systems 
to the extent that a critical system fails or is not properly implemented and the failure cannot be corrected in a timely manner  the company may experience disruptions to the business that could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality  integrity  and availability of internal or policyholder systems and data could result in damages to the company reputation and or subject us to expenses  fines or lawsuits 
the company collects and retains large volumes of internal and policyholder data  including personally identifiable information  for business purposes including underwriting  claims and billing purposes  and relies upon the various information technology systems that enter  process  summarize and report such data 
the company also maintains personally identifiable information about its employees 
the confidentiality and protection of our policyholder  employee and company data are critical 
table of contents to the company business 
the company policyholders and employees have a high expectation that it will adequately protect their personal information 
the regulatory environment  as well as the requirements imposed by the payment card industry and insurance regulators  governing information  security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve 
maintaining compliance with applicable information security and privacy regulations may increase the company operating costs and or adversely impact its ability to market products and services to its policyholders 
furthermore  a penetrated or compromised information technology system or the intentional  unauthorized  inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft  loss  fraudulent or unlawful use of policyholder  employee or company data which could harm the company reputation or result in remedial and other expenses  fines or lawsuits 
changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting bodies may adversely affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements are subject to the application of gaap  which is periodically revised and or expanded 
accordingly  the company is required to adopt new or revised accounting standards from time to time issued by recognized authoritative bodies  including the fasb 
it is possible that future changes the company is required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that the company applies to its consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs 
the ultimate adoption of such standards could negatively impact its financial condition or results of operations 
although not yet required  the company could be required to adopt ifrs  which differs from gaap  for the company s accounting and reporting standards 
the ultimate implementation and adoption of new standards could materially impact the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect acts of fraud 
the company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the securities exchange act of  as amended  is accumulated and communicated to management and is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec s rules and forms 
the company s management  including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer  believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  the company cannot provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been prevented or detected 
these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and the company cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of  as amended  and the related rules and regulations promulgated by the sec require the company to include in its annual report on form k a report by its management regarding the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of its fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in the company s internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
areas of the company s internal control over financial reporting may require improvement from time to time 
if management is unable to assert that the company s internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if the company s independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of those internal controls  investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of the company s financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on the company s stock price 
the ability of the company to attract  develop and retain talented employees  managers and executives  and to maintain appropriate staffing levels  is critical to the company s success 
the company is constantly hiring and training new employees and seeking to retain current employees 
an inability to attract  retain and motivate the necessary employees for the operation and expansion of the company s business could hinder its ability to conduct its business activities successfully  develop new products and attract customers 

table of contents the company s success also depends upon the continued contributions of its executive officers  both individually and as a group 
the company s future performance will be substantially dependent on its ability to retain and motivate its management team 
the loss of the services of any of the company s executive officers could prevent the company from successfully implementing its business strategy  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
challenging economic conditions may negatively affect the company s business and operating results 
challenging economic conditions could adversely affect the company in the form of consumer behavior and pressure on its investment portfolio 
consumer behavior could include policy cancellations  modifications  or non renewals  which may reduce cash flows from operations and investments  may harm the company s financial position  and may reduce the insurance companies statutory surplus 
challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability of the company s customers to pay premiums as they fall due  and as a result  the company s bad debt reserves and write offs could increase 
it is also possible that claims fraud may increase 
the recent sovereign debt crisis in europe is leading to weaker global economic growth  heightened financial vulnerabilities and some negative rating actions 
the company s investment portfolios could be adversely affected as a result of deteriorating financial and business conditions affecting the issuers of the securities in the company s investment portfolio 
in addition  declines in the company s profitability could result in a charge to earnings for the impairment of goodwill  which would not affect the company s cash flow but could decrease its earnings  and its stock price could be adversely affected 
many businesses are experiencing a slow recovery from the severe economic recession  and economic uncertainty is expected to continue due in large part to continuing political disagreements in washington that may cause businesses and consumers to hold back spending 
the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of the current global economic conditions and their impact on the united states  and in california  where the majority of the company s business is produced 
if economic conditions do not show significant improvement  there could be an adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
the company may be adversely affected if economic conditions result in either inflation or deflation 
in an inflationary environment  established reserves may become inadequate and increase the company s loss ratio  and market interest rates may rise and reduce the value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio  while increasing interest expense on its libor based debt 
the dois may not approve premium rate increases in time for the company to adequately mitigate inflated loss costs 
in a deflationary environment  some fixed maturity issuers may have difficulty meeting their debt service obligations and thereby reduce the value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio  equity investments may decrease in value  and policyholders may experience difficulties paying their premiums to the company  which could adversely affect premium revenue 
the company s business is vulnerable to significant losses related to sinkhole claims  which could have an adverse effect on its results of operations 
in  the company began its withdrawal from the florida homeowners market due to the high incidence of sinkhole claims 
while the company has closed many sinkhole claims  and believes it has adequately reserved for the remaining open claims  it remains possible for legal or legislative action to require opening closed claims that could impair profitability 
the company completed its withdrawal from the florida homeowners market in september risks related to the company s industry the private passenger automobile insurance industry is highly competitive  and the company may not be able to compete effectively against larger  better capitalized companies 
the company competes with many property and casualty insurance companies selling private passenger automobile insurance in the states in which the company operates 
many of these competitors are better capitalized than the company and have higher am best ratings 
the superior capitalization of the competitors may enable them to offer lower rates  to withstand larger losses  and to more effectively take advantage of new marketing opportunities 
the company s competition may also become increasingly better capitalized in the future as the traditional barriers between insurance companies and banks and other financial institutions erode and as the property and casualty industry continues to consolidate 
the company s ability to compete against these larger  better capitalized competitors depends on its ability to deliver superior service and its strong relationships with independent agents 
the company may undertake strategic marketing and operating initiatives to improve its competitive position and drive growth 
if the company is unable to successfully implement new strategic initiatives or if the company s marketing campaigns do not attract new customers  the company s competitive position may be harmed  which could adversely affect the company s business and results of operations 
additionally  in the event of a failure of any competitor  the company and other insurance 
table of contents companies would likely be required by state law to absorb the losses of the failed insurer and would be faced with an unexpected surge in new business from the failed insurer s former policyholders 
the company may be adversely affected by changes in the private passenger automobile insurance industry 
of the company s direct written premiums for the year ended december  were generated from private passenger automobile insurance policies 
adverse developments in the market for personal automobile insurance or the personal automobile insurance industry in general  whether related to changes in competition  pricing or regulations  could cause the company s results of operations to suffer 
the property casualty insurance industry is also exposed to the risks of severe weather conditions  such as rainstorms  snowstorms  hail and ice storms  hurricanes  tornadoes  wild fires  sinkholes  earthquakes and  to a lesser degree  explosions  terrorist attacks  and riots 
the automobile insurance business is also affected by cost trends that impact profitability 
factors which negatively affect cost trends include inflation in automobile repair costs  automobile parts costs  used car prices  and medical care 
the company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions  including legal  regulatory and social responses thereto  may have on its business 
various scientists  environmentalists  international organizations  regulators and other commentators believe that global climate change has added  and will continue to add  to the unpredictability  frequency and severity of natural disasters including  but not limited to  hurricanes  tornadoes  freezes  other storms and fires in certain parts of the world 
in response  a number of legal and regulatory measures and social initiatives have been introduced in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas and other carbon emissions that may be chief contributors to global climate change 
the company cannot predict the impact that changing climate conditions  if any  will have on its business or its customers 
it is also possible that the legal  regulatory and social responses to climate change could have a negative effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
the insurance industry is subject to extensive regulation  which may affect the company s ability to execute its business plan and grow its business 
the company is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision by government agencies in each of the states in which its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  sell insurance products  issue policies  or handle claims 
some states impose restrictions or require prior regulatory approval of specific corporate actions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to operate  innovate  obtain necessary rate adjustments in a timely manner or grow its business profitably 
these regulations provide safeguards for policyholders and are not intended to protect the interests of shareholders 
the company s ability to comply with these laws and regulations  and to obtain necessary regulatory action in a timely manner is  and will continue to be  critical to its success 
some of these regulations include required licensing 
the company operates under licenses issued by the doi in the states in which the company sells insurance 
if a regulatory authority denies or delays granting a new license  the company s ability to enter that market quickly or offer new insurance products in that market may be substantially impaired 
in addition  if the doi in any state in which the company currently operates suspends  non renews  or revokes an existing license  the company would not be able to offer affected products in the state 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
transactions between the insurance companies and their affiliates including the company generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior approval of the applicable regulator is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated 
state regulators may refuse to approve or delay approval of some transactions  which may adversely affect the company s ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which the company conducts business require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
if  as permitted in some states  the company begins using new rates before they are approved  it may be required to issue refunds or credits to the company s policyholders if the new rates are ultimately deemed excessive or unfair and disapproved by the applicable state regulator 
in other states  prior approval of rate changes is required and there may be long delays in the approval process or the rates may not be approved 
accordingly  the company s ability to respond to market developments or increased costs in that state can be adversely affected 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
most of the states in which the company operates have laws and regulations that limit its ability to exit a market 
for example  these states may limit a private passenger auto insurer s ability to cancel and non renew policies or they may prohibit the company from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state unless prior approval is received from the state insurance department 
in some states  these regulations extend to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
laws and regulations that limit the 
table of contents company s ability to cancel and non renew policies in some states or locations and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict the company s ability to exit unprofitable markets  which may harm its business and results of operations 
other regulations 
the company must also comply with regulations involving  among other matters the use of non public consumer information and related privacy issues  the use of credit history in underwriting and rating  limitations on the ability to charge policy fees  limitations on types and amounts of investments  the payment of dividends  the acquisition or disposition of an insurance company or of any company controlling an insurance company  involuntary assignments of high risk policies  participation in reinsurance facilities and underwriting associations  assessments and other governmental charges  reporting with respect to financial condition  periodic financial and market conduct examinations performed by state insurance department examiners  and the other regulations discussed in this annual report on form k 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations may also result in regulatory actions  fines and penalties  and in extreme cases  revocation of the company s ability to do business in that jurisdiction 
in addition  the company may face individual and class action lawsuits by insured and other parties for alleged violations of certain of these laws or regulations 
in addition  from time to time  the company may support or oppose legislation or other amendments to insurance regulations in california or other states in which it operates 
consequently  the company may receive negative publicity related to its support or opposition of legislative or regulatory changes that may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
regulation may become more extensive in the future  which may adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
no assurance can be given that states will not make existing insurance related laws and regulations more restrictive in the future or enact new restrictive laws 
new or more restrictive regulation in any state in which the company conducts business could make it more expensive for it to continue to conduct business in these states  restrict the premiums the company is able to charge or otherwise change the way the company does business 
in such events  the company may seek to reduce its writings in or to withdraw entirely from these states 
in addition  from time to time  the united states congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
the company cannot predict whether and to what extent new laws and regulations that would affect its business will be adopted  the timing of any such adoption and what effects  if any  they may have on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds  second injury funds  catastrophe funds  and other mandatory pooling arrangements may reduce the company s profitability 
virtually all states require insurers licensed to do business in their state to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some insured parties as the result of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
many states also have laws that established second injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury which are funded by either assessments based on paid losses or premium surcharge mechanisms 
in addition  as a condition to the ability to conduct business in various states  the insurance subsidiaries must participate in mandatory property and casualty shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements  which provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage from private insurers 
the effect of these assessments and mandatory shared market mechanisms or changes in them could reduce the company s profitability in any given period or limit its ability to grow its business 

table of contents the insurance industry faces risks related to litigation  which  if resolved unfavorably  could result in substantial penalties and or monetary damages  including punitive damages 
in addition  insurance companies incur material expenses in the defense of litigation and their results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected if they fail to accurately project litigation expenses 
insurance companies are subject to a variety of legal actions including employee benefit claims  wage and hour claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims  and fraud and misrepresentation claims 
in addition  insurance companies incur and likely will continue to incur potential liability for claims related to the insurance industry in general and the company s business in particular  such as claims by policyholders alleging failure to pay for  termination or non renewal of coverage  interpretation of policy language  sales practices  claims related to reinsurance matters  and other matters 
such actions can also include allegations of fraud  misrepresentation  and unfair or improper business practices and can include claims for punitive damages 
court decisions and legislative activity may increase exposures for any of the types of claims insurance companies face 
there is a risk that insurance companies could incur substantial legal fees and expenses  including discovery expenses  in any of the actions companies defend in excess of amounts budgeted for defense 
the company and its insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants in a number of lawsuits 
these lawsuits are described more fully at overview b 
regulatory and legal matters in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation  by its very nature  is unpredictable and the outcome of these cases is uncertain 
the precise nature of the relief that may be sought or granted in any lawsuit is uncertain and may negatively impact the manner in which the company conducts its business and results of operations  which could materially increase the company s legal expenses 
in addition  potential litigation involving new claim  coverage  and business practice issues could adversely affect the company s business by changing the way policies are priced  extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent  or increasing the size of claims 
risks related to the company s stock the company is controlled by small number of shareholders who will be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  including change of control transactions 
george joseph and gloria joseph collectively own more than of the company s common stock 
accordingly  george joseph and gloria joseph have the ability to exert significant influence on the actions the company may take in the future  including change of control transactions 
this concentration of ownership may conflict with the interests of the company s other shareholders and lenders 
future sales of common stock may affect the market price of the company s common stock and the future exercise of options and warrants will result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
the company may raise capital in the future through the issuance and sale of shares of its common stock 
the company cannot predict what effect  if any  such future sales will have on the market price of its common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of its common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of the company s outstanding common stock  and may make it more difficult for shareholders to sell common stock at a time and price that the shareholder deems appropriate 
in addition  the company has issued options to purchase shares of its common stock 
in the event that any options to purchase common stock are exercised  shareholders will suffer dilution in their investment 
applicable insurance laws may make it difficult to effect a change of control of the company or the sale of any of its insurance subsidiaries 
before a person can acquire control of a us insurance company or any holding company of a us insurance company  prior written approval must be obtained from the doi of the state where the insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of the insurer or holding company  the state doi will consider a number of factors relating to the acquirer and the transaction 
these laws and regulations may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of the company or the sale by the company of any of its insurance subsidiaries  including transactions that some or all of the company s shareholders might consider to be desirable 
although the company has consistently paid cash dividends in the past  it may not be able to pay cash dividends in the future 
the company has paid cash dividends on a consistent basis since the public offering of its common stock in november however  future cash dividends will depend upon a variety of factors  including the company s profitability  financial condition  capital needs  future prospects  and other factors deemed relevant by the board of directors 
the company s ability to pay dividends may also be limited by the ability of the insurance companies to make distributions to the company  which may 
table of contents be restricted by financial  regulatory or tax constraints  and by the terms of the company s debt instruments 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to pay dividends even if the necessary financial and regulatory conditions are met and if sufficient cash is available for distribution

overview a 
general the operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to significant quarter to quarter and year to year fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing  the frequency and severity of losses  the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses  general economic conditions  the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates  state regulation of premium rates  changes in fair value of investments  and other factors such as changes in tax laws 
the property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical  with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity 
these cycles can have a large impact on the company s ability to grow and retain business 

table of contents the company is headquartered in los angeles  california and operates primarily as a personal automobile insurer selling policies through a network of independent agents in thirteen states 
the company also offers homeowners  commercial automobile and property  mechanical breakdown  fire  and umbrella insurance 
private passenger automobile lines of insurance accounted for of the billion of the company s direct premiums written in of the private passenger automobile premiums were written in california 
the company also operates in arizona  florida  georgia  illinois  michigan  nevada  new jersey  new york  oklahoma  pennsylvania  texas  and virginia 
the company expects to continue its growth by expanding into new states in the future to achieve greater geographic diversification 
there are challenges and risks involved in entering each new state  including establishing adequate rates without any operating history in the state  working with a new regulatory regime  hiring and training competent personnel  building adequate systems  and finding qualified agents to represent the company 
the company does not expect to enter into any new states during this section discusses some of the relevant factors that management considers in evaluating the company s performance  prospects  and risks 
it is not all inclusive and is meant to be read in conjunction with the entirety of management s discussion and analysis  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and all other items contained within this annual report on form k 
financial performance summary the company s net income for the year ended december  decreased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for the same period in approximately million in pre tax investment income was generated during on a portfolio of approximately billion at fair value at december   compared to million pre tax investment income during on a portfolio of approximately billion at fair value at december  included in net income are net realized investment gains of million and million in and  respectively 
net realized investment gains include gains of million and million in and  respectively  due to changes in the fair value of total investments pursuant to application of the fair value accounting option 
during  the company continued its marketing efforts to enhance name recognition and lead generation 
the company believes that its marketing efforts  combined with its ability to maintain relatively low prices and a strong reputation  make the company very competitive in california and in other states 
the company believes its thorough underwriting process gives it an advantage over competitors 
the company views its agent relationships and underwriting process as one of its primary competitive advantages because it allows the company to charge lower rates yet realize better margins than many competitors 
the company s operating results and growth have allowed it to consistently generate positive cash flow from operations  which was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
cash flow from operations has been used to pay shareholder dividends and help support growth 
economic and industry wide factors regulatory uncertainty the insurance industry is subject to strict state regulation and oversight and is governed by the laws of each state in which each insurance company operates 
state regulators generally have substantial power and authority over insurance companies including  in some states  approving rate changes and rating factors  and establishing minimum capital and surplus requirements 
in many states  insurance commissioners may emphasize different agendas or interpret existing regulations differently than previous commissioners 
there is no certainty that current or future regulations and the interpretation of those regulations by insurance commissioners and the courts will not have an adverse impact on the company 
cost uncertainty because insurance companies pay claims after premiums are collected  the ultimate cost of an insurance policy is not known until well after the policy revenues are earned 
consequently  significant assumptions are made when establishing insurance rates and loss reserves 
while insurance companies use sophisticated models and experienced actuaries to assist in setting rates and establishing loss reserves  there can be no assurance that current rates or current reserve estimates will be adequate 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that insurance regulators will approve rate increases when the company s actuarial analysis shows that they are needed 
economic conditions many businesses are experiencing a slow recovery from the severe economic recession  and economic uncertainty is expected to continue in due in large part to continuing political disagreements in washington that may cause businesses and consumers to hold back spending 
further  the sovereign debt crisis in europe continues to lead to weaker global economic growth  heightened financial vulnerabilities and some negative 
table of contents rating actions 
the company is unable to predict the duration and severity of current global economic conditions and their impact on the united states  and california  where the majority of the company s business is produced 
if economic conditions do not show improvement  there could be an adverse impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity 
inflation the largest cost component for automobile insurers is losses  which include medical costs  replacement automobile parts  and labor costs 
there can be significant variation in the overall increases in medical cost inflation  and it is often a year or more after the respective fiscal period ends before sufficient claims have closed for the inflation rate to be known with a reasonable degree of certainty 
therefore  it can be difficult to establish reserves and set premium rates  particularly when actual inflation rates may be higher or lower than anticipated 
loss frequency another component of overall loss costs is loss frequency  which is the number of claims per risk insured 
there has been a long term trend of declining loss frequency in the personal automobile insurance industry 
however  in recent years  the trend has shown increasing loss frequency  and the company may not be able to accurately predict the trend of loss frequency in the future 
underwriting cycle and competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly cyclical  with alternating hard and soft market conditions 
the company has historically seen significant premium growth during hard markets 
the company believes that the market may be hardening as growth has begun to improve throughout technology in  the company continued to enhance its internet agency portal  mercury first 
mercury first is a single entry point for agents providing a broad suite of capabilities 
one of its most powerful tools is a point of sale pos system that allows agents to easily obtain and compare quotes and write new business 
mercury first is designed as an easy to use agency portal that provides a customized work queue for each agency user showing new business leads  underwriting requests and other pertinent customer information in real time 
agents can also assist customers with processing payments  reporting claims or updating their records 
the system enables quick access to documents and forms and empowers the agents with several self service capabilities 
the nextgen system is designed to be a multi state  multi line system 
nextgen serves as the primary platform for all underwriting  billing  claims  and commission functions supporting the private passenger auto line in seven states virginia  new york  florida  california  georgia  illinois  and texas 
during  the company launched guidewire  a commercially available software solution  to replace legacy platforms and implemented it for the nevada homeowners line 
in  the company expanded the guidewire implementation to texas  georgia  illinois  pennsylvania  and oklahoma for the homeowners line of business and for the texas commercial auto line of business 
in  the company continued to expand the guidewire implementation to california  oklahoma  georgia  and arizona for the commercial auto line and to michigan and nevada for the private passenger automobile line 
the company plans to expand guidewire to other states and lines of business during in  as part of its continuing commitment to service excellence  the company enhanced the web capability for customers in california and georgia to bind and pay for new policies online 
these policies are serviced by the company s agents 
the company plans to expand this capability to other states in the future 
b 
regulatory and legal matters the process for implementing rate changes varies by state  with california  georgia  new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  and nevada requiring prior approval from the respective doi before a rate change may be implemented 
illinois  texas  virginia  arizona  and michigan only require that rates be filed with the doi 
oklahoma and florida have a modified version of prior approval laws 
in all states  the insurance code provides that rates must not be excessive  inadequate  or unfairly discriminatory 
for the company s two largest lines of business  private passenger automobile and homeowners  the company filed rate increases in thirteen states during the california doi uses rating factor regulations requiring automobile insurance rates to be determined in decreasing order of importance by driving safety record  miles driven per year  years of driving experience  and other factors as determined by the california doi to have a substantial relationship to the risk of loss and adopted by regulation 
on october   the company implemented the california doi approved rate increase of approximately on california private passenger automobile policies 
the rate increase has not had a significant impact on the number of new and renewal policies written 
in october  the company filed for a rate increase in caic private passenger automobile 
table of contents line of business  and plans to file for a rate increase in mic private passenger automobile line of business 
the company must obtain approval from the california doi before implementing these new rates 
in may  the company filed for a rate increase for its california homeowners line of business 
in may  the matter was referred to an administrative law judge for review 
after extensive evidentiary hearings  the administrative law judge delivered a proposed decision on the matter to the california insurance commissioner in september that recommended a rate reduction of approximately 
on october   the company received notice from the california insurance commissioner rejecting the administrative law judge proposed decision and referred the matter back to the administrative law judge to gather more evidence 
however  the california insurance commissioner recently issued a ruling to disregard his order to gather more evidence 
the company expects a final ruling from the california insurance commissioner on this matter in the near future 
the company does not agree with the proposed rate decrease and believes that recent homeowners loss trends support an increase 
consequently  the company recently filed for a rate increase of 
in january  the california doi approved auto body repair regulation to strengthen consumer protection 
this regulation builds on existing protection by requiring insurers to settle automobile insurance claims using repair standards described by the regulation and not by the insurers own standards 
the new ruling will become effective in march the full extent of the impact is currently unknown 
in april  the california doi issued a notice of non compliance nnc to mercury insurance company mic  mercury casualty company mcc  and california automobile insurance company caic based on a report of examination of the rating and underwriting practices of these companies issued by the california doi in february the nnc includes allegations of instances of noncompliance with applicable california insurance law and seeks to require that each of mic  mcc  and caic change its rating and underwriting practices to rectify the alleged noncompliance and may also seek monetary penalties 
in april  the company submitted a statement of compliance and notice of defense to the nnc  in which it denied the allegations contained in the nnc and provided specific defenses to each allegation 
the company also requested a hearing in the event that the statement of compliance and notice of defense does not establish to the satisfaction of the california doi that the alleged noncompliance does not exist  and the matters described in the nnc are not otherwise able to be resolved informally with the california doi 
however  no assurance can be given that efforts to resolve the nnc informally will be successful 
in march  the california doi issued an amended notice of non compliance to a notice of non compliance originally issued in february as amended  nnc alleging that the company charged rates in violation of the california insurance code  willfully permitted its agents to charge broker fees in violation of california law  and willfully misrepresented the actual price insurance consumers could expect to pay for insurance by the amount of a fee charged by the consumer insurance broker 
the california doi seeks to impose a fine for each policy in which the company allegedly permitted an agent to charge a broker fee and a penalty for each on which the company allegedly used a misleading advertisement and to suspend certificates of authority for a period of one year 
in january  the administrative law judge bifurcated the nnc between a the california doi s order to show cause  in which the california doi asserts the false advertising allegations and accusation  and b the california doi s notice of noncompliance  in which the california doi asserts the unlawful rate allegations 
in february  the administrative law judge submitted a proposed decision dismissing the california doi s nnc 
in march  the california insurance commissioner rejected the administrative law judge s proposed decision 
the company challenged the rejection in los angeles superior court in april  and the california insurance commissioner filed a demurrer to the company petition 
following a hearing  the trial court sustained the california insurance commissioner s demurrer without leave to amend because it found the company must first exhaust its administrative remedies 
the company has appealed the trial court s decision and on january   filed a petition to stay the administrative proceeding pending a determination of its appeal 
the court of appeal did not stay the adminstrative proceeding but has allowed the appeal to continue 
the company has filed its opening appellate brief  and the court granted the company request for an expedited appeal 
on january   the administrative law judge heard various pending motions that had originally been filed by the company in june the administrative law judge has not yet ruled on the motions 
the company denies the allegations in the and nnc matters  and believes that no monetary penalties are warranted  and the company intends to defend itself against the allegations vigorously 
the company has been subject to fines and penalties by the california doi in the past due to alleged violations of the california insurance code 
the largest and most recent of these was settled in for  however  prior settlement amounts are not necessarily indicative of the potential results in the current notice of non compliance matters 
based upon its understanding of the facts and the california insurance code  the company does not expect that the ultimate resolution of the and nnc matters will be material to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
the company has accrued a liability for the estimated cost to defend itself in the notice of non compliance matters 

table of contents the company is  from time to time  named as a defendant in various lawsuits or regulatory actions incidental to its insurance business 
the majority of lawsuits brought against the company relate to insurance claims that arise in the normal course of business and are reserved for through the reserving process 
for a discussion of the company s reserving methods  see critical accounting estimates and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company also establishes reserves for non insurance claims related lawsuits  regulatory actions  and other contingencies for which the company is able to estimate its potential exposure and when the company believes a loss is probable 
for loss contingencies believed to be reasonably possible  the company also discloses the nature of the loss contingency and an estimate of the possible loss  range of loss  or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made 
while actual losses may differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of the company s pending actions is generally not yet determinable  the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in all cases  the company vigorously defends itself unless a reasonable settlement appears appropriate 
for a discussion of legal matters  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies litigation 
c 
critical accounting estimates reserves preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires judgment and estimates 
the most significant is the estimate of loss reserves 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult process as many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and  therefore  the reserve that is required 
changes in the regulatory and legal environment  results of litigation  medical costs  the cost of repair materials  and labor rates  among other factors  can impact ultimate claim costs 
in addition  time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of a claim  the more variable the ultimate settlement amount could be 
accordingly  short tail claims  such as property damage claims  tend to be more reasonably predictable than long tail liability claims 
the company calculates a point estimate rather than a range of loss reserve estimate 
there is inherent uncertainty with estimates and this is particularly true with estimates for loss reserves 
this uncertainty comes from many factors which may include changes in claims reporting and settlement patterns  changes in the regulatory or legal environment  uncertainty over inflation rates and uncertainty for unknown items 
the company does not make specific provisions for these uncertainties  rather it considers them in establishing its reserve by looking at historical patterns and trends and projecting these out to current reserves 
the underlying factors and assumptions that serve as the basis for preparing the reserve estimate include paid and incurred loss development factors  expected average costs per claim  inflation trends  expected loss ratios  industry data  and other relevant information 
the company also engages an independent actuarial consultant to review the company s reserves and to provide the annual actuarial opinions required under state statutory accounting requirements 
the company does not rely on the actuarial consultant for gaap reporting or periodic report disclosure purposes 
the company analyzes loss reserves quarterly primarily using the incurred loss  claim count development  and average severity methods described below 
the company also uses the paid loss development method to analyze loss adjustment expense reserves as part of its reserve analysis 
when deciding among methods to use  the company evaluates the credibility of each method based on the maturity of the data available and the claims settlement practices for each particular line of business or coverage within a line of business 
when establishing the reserve  the company will generally analyze the results from all of the methods used rather than relying on a single method 
while these methods are designed to determine the ultimate losses on claims under the company s policies  there is inherent uncertainty in all actuarial models since they use historical data to project outcomes 
the company believes that the techniques it uses provide a reasonable basis in estimating loss reserves 
the incurred loss development method analyzes historical incurred case loss case reserves plus paid losses development to estimate ultimate losses 
the company applies development factors against current case incurred losses by accident period to calculate ultimate expected losses 
the company believes that the incurred loss development method provides a reasonable basis for evaluating ultimate losses  particularly in the company s larger  more established lines of business which have a long operating history 
the average severity method analyzes historical loss payments and or incurred losses divided by closed claims and or total claims to calculate an estimated average cost per claim 
from this  the expected ultimate average cost per claim can be estimated 
the average severity method coupled with the claim count development method provide meaningful information regarding inflation and frequency trends that the company believes is useful in establishing reserves 
the claim count development method analyzes historical claim count development to estimate future incurred claim count 
table of contents development for current claims 
the company applies these development factors against current claim counts by accident period to calculate ultimate expected claim counts 
the paid loss development method analyzes historical payment patterns to estimate the amount of losses yet to be paid 
the company uses this method for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the company analyzes catastrophe losses separately from non catastrophe losses 
for catastrophe losses  the company determines claim counts based on claims reported and development expectations from previous catastrophes and applies an average expected loss per claim based on reserves established by adjusters and average losses on previous similar catastrophes 
there are many factors that can cause variability between the ultimate expected loss and the actual developed loss 
while there are certainly other factors  the company believes that the following three items tend to create the most variability between expected losses and actual losses 
inflation for the company s california automobile lines of business  total reserves are comprised of the following bi reserves approximately of total reserves material damage md reserves  including collision and comprehensive property damage approximately of total reserves loss adjustment expenses reserves approximately of total reserves 
loss development on md reserves is generally insignificant because md claims are generally settled in a shorter period than bi claims 
the majority of the loss adjustment expense reserves are estimated costs to defend bi claims  which tend to require longer periods of time to settle as compared to md claims 
bi loss reserves are generally the most difficult to estimate because they take longer to close than other coverages 
bi coverage in the company s policies includes injuries sustained by any person other than the insured  except in the case of uninsured or underinsured motorist bi coverage  which covers damages to the insured for bi caused by uninsured or underinsured motorists 
bi payments are primarily for medical costs and general damages 
the following table presents the typical closure patterns of bi claims in the california automobile insurance coverage of total claims closed dollars paid bi claims closed in the accident year reported bi claims closed one year after the accident year reported bi claims closed two years after the accident year reported bi claims closed three years after the accident year reported bi claims closed in the accident year reported are generally the smaller and less complex claims that settle for approximately  to  on average  whereas the total average settlement  once all claims are closed in a particular accident year  is approximately  to  the company creates incurred and paid loss triangles to estimate ultimate losses utilizing historical payment and reserving patterns and evaluates the results of this analysis against its frequency and severity analysis to establish bi reserves 
the company adjusts development factors to account for inflation trends it sees in loss severity 
as a larger proportion of claims from an accident year are settled  there becomes a higher degree of certainty for the reserves established for that accident year 
consequently  there is a decreasing likelihood of reserve development on any particular accident year  as those periods age 
at december   the company believes that the accident years that are most likely to develop are the through accident years  however  it is possible that older accident years could develop as well 
in general  the company expects that historical claims trends will continue with costs tending to increase  which is generally consistent with historical data  and therefore the company believes that it is reasonable to expect inflation to continue 
the company is experiencing inflation at a rate that is higher than in recent years 
many potential factors can affect the bi inflation rate  including changes in claims handling process  statutes and regulations  the number of litigated files  increased use of medical procedures such as mris and epidural injections  general economic factors  timeliness of claims adjudication  vehicle safety  weather patterns  and gasoline prices  among other factors  however  the magnitude of such impact on the inflation rate is unknown 

table of contents it is a common practice in the insurance industry for companies to provide small settlement offers at the inception of a claim to bi claimants who have minor injuries 
these claims are settled quickly  reducing the likelihood that bi claimants require larger settlements later on 
it also results in some claimants receiving payments that would not have received any payments if an extended adjudication of the claim had occurred 
when a large percentage of the total claims are small dollar value claims resulting from this practice  it has the effect of lowering the total average cost for all claims severity but increasing the total number of claims frequency 
mercury has historically used this approach to handle its bi claims 
beginning late in and continuing through the end of  the company changed its claims handling procedures and discontinued the practice of providing small settlement offers to bi claimants at the inception of the claim 
this had the effect of increasing loss severity and decreasing loss frequency for the accident year 
the prior practice was reinstated in  which resulted in decreased loss severity and increased loss frequency in compared to the company has continued this practice with even greater emphasis on settling small claims quickly 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that the california automobile bi severity could vary from recorded amounts by as much as   and for   and  respectively 
for example  at december   the loss severity for the amounts recorded at december  increased by   and for the   and accident years  respectively 
the following table presents the effects on the   and accident year california bi loss reserves based on possible variations in the severity recorded  however  the variation could be more or less than these amounts

the change in the implied inflation rate in and is skewed by the change in claims handling process noted above 
the inflation rate estimated for reflects the consideration of recent trends experienced on accident year claims that closed in while these claims represent just of the ultimate dollars expected to be paid  they serve as an early indicator of inflation 
the higher inflation may result from an increase in medical procedures and an increased prevalence of large losses 
claim count development the company generally estimates ultimate claim counts for an accident period based on development of claim counts in prior accident periods 
since  for california automobile bi claims  the company has experienced that approximately to additional claims will be reported in the year subsequent to an accident year 
however  such late reported claims could be more or less than the company s expectations 
typically  almost every claim is reported within one year following the end of an accident year and at that point the company has a high degree of certainty as to what the ultimate claim count will be 
there are many other potential factors that can affect the number of claims reported after a period end 
these factors include changes in weather patterns  a change in the number of litigated files  the number of automobiles insured  and whether the last day of the year falls on a weekday or a weekend 
however  the company is unable to determine which  if any  of the factors actually impact the number of claims reported and  if so  by what magnitude 
at december   there were  bi claims reported for the accident year and the company estimates that these are expected to ultimately grow by approximately 
the company believes that while actual development in recent years has ranged between approximately and  it is reasonable to expect that the range could be as great as between and 
actual development may be more or less than the expected range 
the following table presents the effect on loss development based on different claim count within the broader possible range at december  
table of contents california bodily injury claim count reserve sensitivity analysis accident year claims reported amount recorded at at claim count development total expected amount if claim count development is total expected amount if claim count development is claim count approximate average cost per claim not meaningful total dollars not meaningful total loss development favorable unfavorable unexpected large losses from older accident periods unexpected large losses are generally not provided for in the current reserve because they are not known or expected and tend to be unquantifiable 
once known  the company establishes a provision for the losses  but it is not possible to provide any meaningful sensitivity analysis as to the potential size of any unexpected losses 
these losses can be caused by many factors  including unexpected legal interpretations of coverage  ineffective claims handling  regulation extending claims reporting periods  assumption of unexpected or unknown risks  adverse court decisions as well as many unknown factors 
unexpected large losses are fairly infrequent but can have a large impact on the company s losses 
to mitigate this risk  the company has established claims handling and review procedures 
however  it is still possible that these procedures will not prove entirely effective  and the company may have material unexpected large losses in future periods 
it is also possible that the company has not identified and established a sufficient reserve for all unexpected large losses occurring in the older accident years  even though a comprehensive claims file review was undertaken 
the company may experience additional development on these reserves 
discussion of losses and loss reserves and prior period loss development at december  at december  and  the company recorded its point estimate of approximately  million and million  respectively  in losses and loss adjustment expense liabilities which include approximately million and million  respectively  of ibnr loss reserves 
ibnr includes estimates  based upon past experience  of ultimate developed costs  which may differ from case estimates  unreported claims that occurred on or prior to december  and estimated future payments for reopened claims 
management believes that the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses is adequate to cover the ultimate net cost of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to date  however  since the provisions are necessarily based upon estimates  the ultimate liability may be more or less than such provisions 
during  the company experienced severe losses due to hurricane sandy which made landfall in new jersey on october  and caused significant damage to large portions of the northeastern united states 
the company total losses from hurricane sandy are estimated to be approximately million 
the company also recognized catastrophe losses due to wind and hail storms in the midwest region totaling million 
the company evaluates its reserves quarterly 
when management determines that the estimated ultimate claim cost requires a decrease for previously reported accident years  favorable development occurs and a reduction in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
if the estimated ultimate claim cost requires an increase for previously reported accident years  unfavorable development occurs and an increase in losses and loss adjustment expenses is reported in the current period 
for  the company reported unfavorable development of approximately million on the and prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expense reserves  which at december  totaled approximately million 
the unfavorable development in is largely the result of re estimates of california bi losses that have experienced both higher average severities and more late reported claims claim count development than originally estimated at december  premiums the company s insurance premiums are recognized as income ratably over the term of the policies and in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
unearned premiums are carried as a liability on the balance sheet and are computed on a monthly pro rata basis 
the company evaluates its unearned premiums periodically for premium deficiencies by comparing the sum of expected claim costs  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs partially offset by investment income to related unearned premiums 
to the extent that any of the company s lines of business become unprofitable  a premium deficiency reserve may be required 

table of contents investments the company s fixed maturity and equity investments are classified as trading and carried at fair value as required when applying the fair value option  with changes in fair value reflected in net realized investment gains or losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the majority of equity holdings  including non redeemable fund preferred stocks  is actively traded on national exchanges or trading markets  and is valued at the last transaction price on the balance sheet dates 
fair value of financial instruments the financial instruments recorded in the consolidated balance sheets include investments  receivables  interest rate swap agreements  accounts payable  equity contracts  and secured notes payable 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
due to their short term maturity  the carrying values of receivables and accounts payable approximate their fair market values 
all investments are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s financial instruments include securities issued by the us government and its agencies  securities issued by states and municipal governments and agencies  certain corporate and other debt securities  equity securities  and exchange traded funds 
approximately of the fair value of the financial instruments held at december  is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary by financial instrument 
observable market prices and pricing parameters of a financial instrument  or a related financial instrument  are used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
the company may hold or acquire financial instruments that lack observable market prices or market parameters currently or in future periods because they are less actively traded 
the fair value of such instruments is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular financial instrument 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
the price transparency of the particular financial instrument will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of financial instrument  whether it is a new financial instrument and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
financial instruments for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  financial instruments that are thinly traded or not quoted will generally have diminished price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced from time to time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a financial instrument provides a source of transparency for products that are otherwise not actively quoted 
for a further discussion  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes at december   the company s deferred income taxes were in a net liability position materially due to deferred tax liabilities generated by deferred acquisition costs and unrealized gains on securities held 
these deferred tax liabilities were substantially offset by deferred tax assets resulting from unearned premiums  expense accruals  loss reserve discounting  and amt and other tax credit carryforwards 
the company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realized and  to the extent management does not believe these assets are more likely than not to be realized  a valuation allowance is established 
management s recoverability assessment of its deferred tax assets which are ordinary in character takes into consideration the company s strong history of generating ordinary taxable income and a reasonable expectation that it will continue to generate ordinary taxable income in the future 
further  the company has the capacity to recoup its ordinary deferred tax assets through tax loss carryback claims for taxes paid in prior years 
finally  the company has various deferred tax liabilities which represent sources of future ordinary taxable income 
management s recoverability assessment with regard to its capital deferred tax assets is based on estimates of anticipated capital gains and tax planning strategies available to generate future taxable capital gains  both of which would contribute to the realization of deferred tax benefits 
the company expects to hold certain quantities of debt securities  which are currently in loss positions  to recovery or maturity 
management believes unrealized losses related to these debt securities  which represent a portion of the unrealized loss positions at period end  are fully realizable at maturity 
management believes its long term time horizon for holding these securities allows it to avoid any forced sales prior to maturity 
the company also has unrealized gains in its investment portfolio which could be realized through asset dispositions  at management s discretion 
further  the company has the capability to generate additional realized capital gains by entering into a sale leaseback transaction using one or more of its appreciated real estate holdings 

table of contents the company has the capability to implement tax planning strategies as it has a steady history of generating positive cash flow from operations  as well as the reasonable expectation that its cash flow needs can be met in future periods without the forced sale of its investments 
this capability assists management in controlling the timing and amount of realized losses it generates during future periods 
by prudent utilization of some or all of these strategies  management believes that it has the ability and intent to generate capital gains  and minimize tax losses  in a manner sufficient to avoid losing the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
management will continue to assess the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
the company s effective income tax rate can be affected by several factors 
these generally include tax exempt investment income  non deductible expenses  and periodically  non routine tax items such as adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits related to tax uncertainties 
the effective tax rate for was  compared to for the decrease in the effective tax rate is mainly due to a decrease in taxable income relative to tax exempt investment income 
the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily as a result of tax exempt investment income earned 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets arise from business acquisitions and consist of the excess of the cost of the acquisitions over the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company annually evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
the company also reviews its goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets may exceed the implied fair value 
as of december   the fair value of the company s reporting units exceeded their carrying value 
contingent liabilities the company has known  and may have unknown  potential liabilities which include claims  assessments  lawsuits  or regulatory fines and penalties relating to the company s business 
the company continually evaluates these potential liabilities and accrues for them and or discloses them in the notes to the consolidated financial statements where required 
the company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal or regulatory proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows

results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues net premiums earned and net premiums written in increased and  respectively  from net premiums written by the company california operations and non california operations increased by million and million  respectively  from the increase in net premiums written is primarily due to an increase in the number of policies in force and slightly higher average premiums per policy 
the increase in average premiums per policy partially reflects a modest shift for the california personal automobile line from six month policies to twelve month policies 
premiums on twelve month policies are typically twice that of six month policies 
for  fewer than of california personal automobile policies were written on a twelve month basis and more than were written on a six month basis  whereas in  fewer than of the california personal automobile policies were written on a twelve month basis and over were written on a six month basis 
in addition  the company increased private passenger automobile insurance rates in twelve states outside california and grew its homeowners business in several states outside of california during net premiums written is a non gaap financial measure which represents the premiums charged on policies issued during a fiscal period less any applicable reinsurance 
net premiums written is a statutory measure designed to determine production levels 
net premiums earned  the most directly comparable gaap measure  represents the portion of net premiums written that is recognized as revenue in the financial statements for the period presented and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the policies

the following table presents the company s consolidated loss  expense  and combined ratios determined in accordance with gaap loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio loss ratio is calculated by dividing losses and loss adjustment expenses by net premiums earned 
the company s loss ratio was affected by unfavorable development of approximately million and million on prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the unfavorable development in is largely the result of re estimates of california bi losses which have experienced both higher average severities and more late reported claims claim count development than originally estimated at december  the loss ratio was also negatively impacted by a total of million of catastrophe losses mostly due to hurricane sandy and wind and hail storms in the midwest region during in addition  the loss ratio was negatively impacted by rising loss frequency and increasing severity on the california private passenger automobile line of business 
the loss ratio was negatively impacted by a total of million of catastrophe losses due to california winter storms  hurricane irene  and georgia tornadoes during expense ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of policy acquisition costs plus other operating expenses by net premiums earned 
the improvement in the expense ratio in was mainly due to ongoing cost reduction efforts and lower profitability related expenses 
combined ratio is the key measure of underwriting performance traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance industry 
a combined ratio under generally reflects profitable underwriting results  and a combined ratio over generally reflects unprofitable underwriting results

under current insurance law  the insurance companies are entitled to pay ordinary dividends of approximately million in to mercury general 
the insurance companies paid mercury general ordinary dividends of approximately million during as of december   mercury general had approximately million in investments and cash that could be utilized to satisfy its direct holding company obligations 
the principal sources of funds for the insurance companies are premiums  sales and maturity of invested assets  and dividend and interest income from invested assets 
the principal uses of funds for the insurance companies are the payment of claims and related expenses  operating expenses  dividends to mercury general  payment of debt  and the purchase of investments 
b 
cash flows the company has generated positive cash flow from operations for over twenty consecutive years 
because of the company s long track record of positive operating cash flows  it does not attempt to match the duration and timing of asset maturities with those of liabilities 
rather  the company manages its portfolio with a view towards maximizing total return with an emphasis on 
table of contents after tax income 
with combined cash and short term investments of million at december   the company believes its cash flow from operations is adequate to satisfy its liquidity requirements without the forced sale of investments 
investment maturities are also available to meet the company liquidity needs 
however  the company operates in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the company s sources of funds will be sufficient to meet its liquidity needs or that the company will not be required to raise additional funds to meet those needs or for future business expansion  through the sale of equity or debt securities or from credit facilities with lending institutions 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease was primarily due to the increased payment of income taxes and losses and lower investment income as a result of the lower interest rate environment  partially offset by increased premiums collected 
the company utilized the cash provided by operating activities primarily for the payment of dividends to its shareholders

invested assets portfolio composition an important component of the company s financial results is the return on its investment portfolio 
the company s investment strategy emphasizes safety of principal and consistent income generation  within a total return framework 
the investment strategy has historically focused on maximizing after tax yield with a primary emphasis on maintaining a well diversified  investment grade  fixed income portfolio to support the underlying liabilities and achieve return on capital and profitable growth 
the company believes that investment yield is maximized by selecting assets that perform favorably on a long term basis and by disposing of certain assets to enhance after tax yield and minimize the potential effect of downgrades and defaults 
the company continues to believe that this strategy maintains the optimal investment performance necessary to sustain investment income over time 
the company s portfolio management approach utilizes a market risk and consistent asset allocation strategy as the primary basis for the allocation of interest sensitive  liquid and credit assets as well as for determining overall below investment grade exposure and diversification requirements 
within the ranges set by the asset allocation strategy  tactical investment decisions are made in consideration of prevailing market conditions

included in the gains and losses were million in gains due to changes in the fair value of the company s fixed maturity portfolio and million in losses due to changes in the fair value of the company equity security portfolio  as a result of applying the fair value option 
fixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities include debt securities  which may have fixed or variable principal payment schedules  may be held for indefinite periods of time  and may be used as a part of the company s asset liability strategy or sold in response to changes in interest rates  anticipated prepayments  risk reward characteristics  liquidity needs  tax planning considerations  or other economic factors 
short term investments include money market accounts  options  and short term bonds that are highly rated short duration securities and redeemable within one year 
a primary exposure for the fixed maturity securities is interest rate risk 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
as assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s historical investment philosophy has resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
the nominal average maturities of the overall bond portfolio were years and years years and years including all short term instruments at december  and  respectively 
the portfolio is heavily weighted in investment grade tax exempt municipal bonds 
fixed maturity investments purchased by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the call adjusted average maturities of the overall bond portfolio were years and years years 
table of contents and years including all short term instruments at december  and  respectively  related to holdings which are heavily weighted with high coupon issues that are expected to be called prior to maturity 
the modified durations of the overall bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls were years and years  years and years including all short term instruments  including collateralized mortgage obligations with a modified duration of years and years at december  and  respectively  and short term bonds that carry no duration 
modified duration measures the length of time it takes  on average  to receive the present value of all the cash flows produced by a bond  including reinvestment of interest 
as it measures four factors maturity  coupon rate  yield  and call terms which determine sensitivity to changes in interest rates  modified duration is considered a better indicator of price volatility than simple maturity alone 
another exposure related to the fixed maturity securities is credit risk  which is managed by maintaining a weighted average portfolio credit quality rating of aa  at fair value  consistent with the average rating at december  to calculate the weighted average credit quality ratings as disclosed throughout this annual report on form k  individual securities were weighted based on fair value and a credit quality numeric score that was assigned to each rating grade 
tax exempt bond holdings are broadly diversified geographically 
taxable holdings consist principally of investment grade issues 
at december   fixed maturity holdings rated below investment grade and non rated bonds totaled million and million  respectively  at fair value  and represented and  respectively  of total fixed maturity securities 
at december   below investment grade and non rated fixed maturity holdings totaled million and million  respectively  at fair value  and represented and  respectively  of total fixed maturity securities 
the following table presents the credit quality ratings of the company s fixed maturity portfolio by security type at december  at fair value 
the company s estimated credit quality ratings are based on the average of ratings assigned by nationally recognized securities rating organizations 
credit ratings for the company s fixed maturity portfolio were stable as compared to the prior year  with of fixed maturity securities at fair value experiencing no change in their overall rating 
of fixed maturity securities at fair value experienced upgrades  partially offset by in credit downgrades

the company had million  of its fixed maturity portfolio  at fair value in us government bonds and agencies and mortgage backed securities agencies 
in august  standard and poor s downgraded the us government s long term sovereign credit rating from aaa to aa 
this downgrade has triggered significant volatility in prices for a variety of investments 
while moody s and fitch affirmed their aaa ratings  they placed a negative outlook in november and warned of a potential downgrade if no long term deficit agreement was reached over the next two years 
the negative outlook reflects these rating agencies declining confidence that timely fiscal measures will be forthcoming to place us public finances on a sustainable path and secure the aaa ratings 
standard and poor s affirmed the us treasury s short term credit rating of aaa indicating that the short term capacity of the us to meet its financial commitment on its outstanding obligations is strong 
the company understands 
table of contents that market participants continue to use rates of return on us government debt as a risk free rate 
in addition  since the downgrade  market participants continued to invest in us treasury securities and the current yields on us treasury securities are lower than before the downgrade 
municipal securities the company had billion at fair value billion at amortized cost in municipal bonds at december   of which billion were insured by bond insurers 
for insured municipal bonds that have underlying ratings  the average underlying rating was a at december  at december   the bond insurers providing credit enhancement were assured guaranty corporation and national public finance guarantee corporation  which covered approximately of the insured municipal securities 
the average rating of the company s insured municipal bonds by these bond insurers was a  with an underlying rating of a 
of the remaining insured bonds are non rated or below investment grade  and the company does not believe that these insurers provide credit enhancement to the municipal bonds that they insure 
the company considers the strength of the underlying credit as a buffer against potential market value declines which may result from future rating downgrades of the bond insurers 
in addition  the company has a long term time horizon for its municipal bond holdings which generally allows it to recover the full principal amounts upon maturity and avoid forced sales prior to maturity of bonds that have declined in market value due to the bond insurers rating downgrades 
based on the uncertainty surrounding the financial condition of these insurers  it is possible that there will be additional downgrades to below investment grade ratings by the rating agencies in the future  and such downgrades could impact the fair value of municipal bonds 
mortgage backed securities the mortgage backed securities portfolio is categorized as loans to prime borrowers except for million and million million and million at amortized cost of alt a mortgages at december  and  respectively 
alt a mortgage backed securities are at fixed or variable rates and include certain securities that are collateralized by residential mortgage loans issued to borrowers with stronger credit profiles than sub prime borrowers  but do not qualify for prime financing terms due to high loan to value ratios or limited supporting documentation

regulatory capital requirement the insurance companies must comply with minimum capital requirements under applicable state laws and regulations  and must have adequate reserves for claims 
the minimum statutory capital requirements differ by state and are generally based on balances established by statute  a percentage of annualized premiums  a percentage of annualized loss  or rbc requirements 
the rbc requirements are based on guidelines established by the naic 
the rbc formula was designed to capture the widely varying elements of risks undertaken by writers of different lines of insurance having differing risk characteristics  as well as writers of similar lines where differences in risk may be related to corporate structure  investment policies  reinsurance arrangements  and a number of other factors 
at december   each of the insurance companies had sufficient capital to exceed the highest level of minimum required capital 
among other considerations  industry and regulatory guidelines suggest that the ratio of a property and casualty insurer s annual net premiums written to statutory policyholders surplus should not exceed to based on the combined surplus of all the insurance companies of billion at december   and net premiums written of billion  the ratio of premiums written to surplus was to

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is subject to various market risk exposures primarily due to its investing and borrowing activities 
primary market risk exposures are changes in interest rates  equity prices  and credit risk 
adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in the liquidity of a market  or to changes in market perceptions of creditworthiness and risk tolerance 
the following disclosure reflects estimates of future performance and economic conditions 
actual results may differ 
overview the company s investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and investment risks  including accountability and controls over risk management activities  and specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity  surplus  product profile  and regulatory requirements of the subsidiaries 
executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the company s investment committee 
the company s investment committee focuses on strategies to enhance after tax yields  mitigate market risks  and optimize capital to improve profitability and returns 
the company manages exposures to market risk through the use of asset allocation  duration  and credit ratings 
asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class 
duration limits on the fixed maturities portfolio place restrictions on the amount of interest rate risk that may be taken 
comprehensive day to day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies 
credit risk credit risk is due to uncertainty in a counterparty s ability to meet its obligations 
credit risk is managed by maintaining a high credit quality fixed maturities portfolio 
as of december   the estimated weighted average credit quality rating of the fixed maturities portfolio was aa  at fair value  consistent with the average rating at december  historically  the ten year default rate per moody s for aa rated municipal bonds has been less than 
the company s municipal bond holdings  which represent of its fixed maturity portfolio at december   at fair value  are broadly diversified geographically 

table of contents of municipal bond holdings are tax exempt 
the following table presents municipal bond holdings by state in descending order of holdings at fair value at december  states fair value average rating amounts in thousands texas aa california a florida a illinois a indiana aa other states a total the portfolio is broadly diversified among the states and the largest holdings are in populous states such as texas and california 
these holdings are further diversified primarily among cities  counties  schools  public works  hospitals and state general obligations 
the company has no holdings in the three california municipalities that recently declared bankruptcy stockton  mammoth lakes  and san bernardino 
the company seeks to minimize overall credit risk and ensure diversification by limiting exposure to any particular issuer 
taxable fixed maturity securities represented of the company s fixed maturity portfolio 
of the company s taxable fixed maturity securities were comprised of us government bonds and agencies and mortgage backed securities agencies  which were rated aaa at december  of the company s taxable fixed maturity securities  representing of the total fixed maturity portfolio  were rated below investment grade 
below investment grade issues are considered watch list items by the company  and their status is evaluated within the context of the company s overall portfolio and its investment policy on an aggregate risk management basis  as well as their ability to recover their investment on an individual issue basis 
equity price risk equity price risk is the risk that the company will incur losses due to adverse changes in the equity markets 
at december   the company s primary objective for common equity investments was current income 
the fair value of the equity investments consists of million in common stocks  million in non redeemable preferred stocks  and million in a partnership interest in a private credit fund 
common stock equity assets are typically valued for future economic prospects as perceived by the market 
the company invests more of its portfolio in the energy and utility sector than what is represented in the s p index 
common stocks represented of total investments at fair value 
beta is a measure of a security s systematic non diversifiable risk  which is the percentage change in an individual security s return for a change in the return of the market 
the average beta for the company s common stock holdings was at december  based on a hypothetical or reduction in the overall value of the stock market  the company estimates that the fair value of the common stock portfolio would decrease by million or million  respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the company will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates relative to the interest rate characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities 
the company faces interest rate risk  as it invests substantial funds in interest sensitive assets and issues interest sensitive liabilities 
interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in us treasury yields and other key benchmarks  as well as changes in interest rates resulting from the widening credit spreads and credit exposure to collateralized securities 
the value of the fixed maturity portfolio  which represented of total investment at fair value  is subject to interest rate risk 
as market interest rates decrease  the value of the portfolio increases and vice versa 
a common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is modified duration  a calculation that utilizes maturity  coupon rate  yield and call terms to calculate an average age of the expected cash flows 
the longer the duration  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
the company has historically invested in fixed maturity investments with a goal of maximizing after tax yields and holding assets to the maturity or call date 
since assets with longer maturity dates tend to produce higher current yields  the company s 
table of contents historical investment philosophy resulted in a portfolio with a moderate duration 
bond investments made by the company typically have call options attached  which further reduce the duration of the asset as interest rates decline 
the decrease in municipal bond credit spreads in caused overall interest rates to decrease  which resulted in a decrease in the duration of the company s portfolio 
consequently  the modified duration of the bond portfolio reflecting anticipated early calls was years at december  compared to years and years at december  and  respectively 
given a hypothetical parallel increase of or basis points in interest rates  the company estimates that the fair value of its bond portfolio at december  would decrease by million or million  respectively 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease  the fair value of the company bond portfolio would rise  and it may cause a higher number of the company bonds to be called away 
the proceeds from the called bonds would likely be reinvested at lower yields which would result in lower overall investment income for the company
