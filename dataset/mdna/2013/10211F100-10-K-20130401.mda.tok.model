the electrosurgical line sells electrosurgical products which include desiccators  generators  electrodes  electrosurgical pencils and various ancillary disposable products 
these products are used in surgery for the cutting and coagulation of tissue 
battery operated cauteries are used for precise hemostasis to stop bleeding in ophthalmology and in other fields 
our other revenues are derived from nerve locators  disposable and reusable penlights  medical lighting  license fees  development fees and other miscellaneous income 
most of our products currently are marketed through medical distributors  which distribute to more than  hospitals  doctors offices  and other healthcare facilities 
new distributors are contacted through responses to our advertising in international and domestic medical journals and domestic or international trade shows 
international sales represented of total revenues in and in and our products are sold in more than countries through local dealers which are coordinated by sales and marketing personnel at the clearwater  florida facility

table of contents overall sales increased by or approximately million for the period ending december  when compared to the same period in in  we continued to experience an upward trend in our sales in all three areas of our business 
the largest dollar increase of approximately  was in our cautery product line  which we attribute to us gaining market share due to a reduction in competitors in the marketplace 
the next largest dollar increase was in our electrosurgical product line consisting of a  increase in electrosurgery generators sold primarily to a major oem customer and approximately  increased sales of electrodes 
we also increased our sales of third party medical lighting products by approximately  and various other products by approximately  our sales for the twelve months ended december  outpaced sales for the same period in by approximately million  or 
the increase in sales has been driven mainly by increased demand for our electrosurgical generators both domestically and internationally which amounted to an approximate increase of  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in sales of our new distribution products released this year  coated blades which are categorized as electrosurgical and medical lighting systems which are categorized as other products  amounted to increases of approximately  and  respectively for the year ended december  compared to the same period in however  increases in electrosurgical sales were offset by an approximate decrease of  related to discontinued sales of an oem disposable electrosurgical device for the twelve month period compared to the same period in in addition cautery sales were down by approximately  for the current year ended compared to the same period in we continue to see increased demand for our third party medical lighting products and as part of our ongoing business strategy we will be bringing on more third party medical products to offer through our distribution channel

however  our gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 
this decrease in gross profit percent was due to the product mix that was sold  specifically with the increased sales of our lower margin third party medical lighting sales 
additional contributing factors to the lower gross profit percentage were an increase in labor costs as a percentage of sales from salary increases  increased medical insurance costs and increased overtime required to meet the increase in sales coupled with slight increases in material costs related to our other products sold 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in manufactured overhead cost 
we improved our gross profit margin on a dollar basis by or approximately  during the year ended december   compared to the same period in as a result of a combination of increased sales mentioned above and a net reduction in some of our costs attributed to those sales 
our cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased by mainly as a result of reductions approximating  in direct and indirect labor costs and  eliminated from our consolidating the canadian facility 
the total of these cost savings was offset by approximately  due to higher material cost related to our third party medical lighting sales when compared to our manufactured product lines

to secure our obligations  we granted livneh a security interest in all of our rights and interest of the company in the seal n cut device  including all intellectual property pertaining thereto 
since the loss was quantifiable and known in december  we recognized this settlement loss in in accordance with gaap and all payments hereunder were accrued during the fourth quarter

the total financial impact of this settlement agreement to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  was approximately million 
asset impairment in december  after evaluating the future outlook of our patent related to our seer product line  we determined that the asset value was impaired and further calculated the impairment loss to be approximately million

interest income interest expense total other income expense other income expense as a percentage of revenue change in fair value of liabilities  net other gain as a percentage of sales net interest expense decreased by approximately  or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to principal reductions during of our industrial revenue bonds associated with the acquisition of our clearwater  florida facility 
net interest expense increased by approximately  or for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the refinancing of the industrial revenue bonds in late the change in fair value of liabilities was related to the warrants associated with our equity issuance in april of and adjustment for the fair value of the lican liability 
the derivative warrant liability was valued at approximately  at the issuance date and was valued at approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
this resulted in a year to date gain of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the lican liability fair value was approximately  and  at december  and this resulted in a gain of  for the year ended december interest expense remained relatively similar from through  with a slight increase in due to the refinancing of our industrial revenue bonds associated with the acquisition of our clearwater  florida facility 
we expect that our interest expense for should be similar to the amount incurred in 
table of contents income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
the tax effects of these temporary differences representing the components of deferred tax assets liabilities at december were approximately as follows in thousands deferred tax assets  current us net operating loss carryforwards state net operating loss carryforwards research and development credits amt credits accounts receivable reserves inventory charitable accrued expenses accrued settlement non current estimate of loss and credit carryforwards total deferred tax assets  current deferred tax assets  non current investment in subsidiary loss and credit carryforwards stock based compensation total deferred tax assets  non current deferred tax liabilities  non current inventory state taxes capital property and equipment intangibles unrecognized tax benefit liability for non current temporary differences total deferred tax liabilities  non current net non current deferred income tax asset we consider all positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  including past operating results and future sources of taxable income 
us net operating losses will begin to expire in years beginning in we assess the financial statement impact of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not of being sustained 
all of our positions arise from taxable temporary differences and  as such  the liability has been recognized in the net deferred tax asset  current and non current items to which they relate 
the calculated amount of penalties and interest related to these timing differences were immaterial at december  and in addition  because the amounts are related to temporary timing differences  there would be no material impact on our effective tax rate if recognized

the number of days worth of sales in inventory  which is the total inventory available for production divided by the month average cost of materials  decreased days to days equating to an inventory turn ratio of at december  from days and an inventory turn ratio of at december  the lower number of days worth of sales in inventory which translated into a higher inventory turnover rate is mainly due to the increase in sales related to our generator product lines which contain a greater number of component parts compared to all our other products 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million in net cash used in investing activities was approximately  for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities was approximately  during the change was due mainly to increased purchases of equipment  molds and test fixtures to support our new products 
we used cash from financing activities of approximately  during year ended december  compared to cash used from financing activities of approximately  during year ended december  the change resulted primarily from repayment of principal on our industrial revenue bonds  which totaled approximately  in compared to net repayments of long term debt and capital lease of  in we currently have approximately million outstanding under industrial revenue bonds which we previously used for the purchase and renovation of our clearwater  florida facility 
during these bonds were refinanced through pnc bank  na the bonds  which are being amortized over a year term  balloon in november and bear interest at a fixed interest rate of 
scheduled maturities of this indebtedness are approximately     and  for    and  respectively and approximately million thereafter 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents at december  we believe our cash on hand  as well as anticipated cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to meet our operating cash commitments for the next year 
should additional funds be required  we have secured additional borrowing capacity with pnc bank 
see below 
table of contents in addition  we continue to make substantial investments in the development and marketing of our j plasma technology  which may adversely affect our profitability and cash flow in the next to months 
while we believe that these investments may generate additional revenues and profits in the future  there can be no assurance that j plasma will be successful or that such future revenues and profitability will be realized 
since june of through december   we have invested approximately million in the development and marketing of our j plasma technology 
we have a million secured revolving line of credit facility with pnc bank  which at december  had a zero balance 
advances under the million line of credit are due on demand and bear interest at a rate of daily libor plus and are secured by a perfected first security interest in our inventory and accounts receivable 
in addition we have a separate additional credit facility with pnc bank for up to million specific to financing new equipment purchases 
this credit facility  as amended  provides for a year draw up to the conversion date of october  prior to the conversion dates amounts outstanding bear an interest rate of daily libor plus 
upon conversion  the term is years and will bear an interest rate of daily libor plus 
the note would be secured by a perfected first security interest in the new equipment purchased 
we did not draw on this line during subsequent available borrowings for both these credit facilities are subject to a borrowing base utilizing a percentage of eligible receivables  inventories  and any assigned cash along with certain financial ratios  specifically maintaining i a ratio of tangible net worth of less than to and ii a ratio of minimum fixed charge of to measured on a rolling four quarter basis 
at december   we were in full compliance with the loan covenants and ratios of both the credit facilities 
according to our most recent borrowing base calculation  we had approximately million total availability under the million credit line  of which we currently have a zero balance 
we also have available approximately million under the equipment line of credit 
our future contractual obligations for agreements with initial terms greater than one year and agreements to purchase materials in the normal course of business are summarized as follows in thousands description years ending december  thereafter operating leases employment agreements purchase commitments long term debt total critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  we have adopted various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  fair valued liabilities  sales returns and discounts  stock based compensation and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 

table of contents estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following inventory reserves when necessary we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including property and equipment and intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors that are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
liabilities valued at fair value we generally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow risks or market risks 
however  certain financial instruments  such as warrants  which are indexed to our common stock  are classified as liabilities when either a the holder possesses rights to net cash settlement or b physical or net share settlement is not within our control 
in such instances  net cash settlement is assumed for financial accounting and reporting purposes  even when the terms of the underlying contracts do not provide for net cash settlement 
such financial instruments are initially recorded  and continuously carried  at fair value 
determining the fair value of these instruments involves judgment and the use of certain relevant assumptions including  but not limited to  interest rate risk  historical volatility and stock price  estimated life of the derivative  anti dilution provisions  and conversion redemption privileges 
the use of different assumptions or changes in those assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
stock based compensation under our stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with fasb asc topic  share based payment  with compensation expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date  which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense 

table of contents litigation contingencies from time to time  we are exposed to claims and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and use various methods to resolve these matters in a manner that we believe serves the best interest of the company and our shareholders 
there can be no assurance these actions or other third party assertions will be resolved without costly litigation  or in a manner that is not adverse to our financial position 
we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation matters will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
however  given uncertainties associated with any litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
income taxes the provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are computed based on the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted marginal tax rates 
valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
deferred income tax expenses or credits are based on the changes in the asset or liability from period to period 
we have net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available in certain jurisdictions to reduce future taxable income 
future tax benefits for net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
to the extent that the probable tax outcome of these uncertain tax positions changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
at december   we believe we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax positions 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or we are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 
since inception  we have been subject to tax by both federal and state taxing authorities 
until the respective statutes of limitations expire which may be as much as years while we have unused nol s  we are subject to income tax audits in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
inflation inflation has not materially impacted the operations of our company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements at this time 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our short term investments consist of cash  cash equivalents and overnight investments 
as such we do not believe we are exposed to significant interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid overnight money market investments 
if a change in interest rates were to have occurred on december   this change would not have had a material effect on the fair value of our investment portfolio as of that date
