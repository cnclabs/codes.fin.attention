critical accounting policies and estimates our financial condition and results of operations are based upon certain critical accounting policies  which include estimates  assumptions  and judgments on the part of management 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstance  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the following discussion highlights those policies and the underlying estimates and assumptions  which we consider critical to an understanding of the financial information in this report 
use of estimates and assumptions the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue  expenses  and contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on various factors and information which may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  and current economic conditions and information from third party professionals that is believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents investments we invest our excess cash primarily in debt instruments of high quality corporate and government issuers 
all highly liquid instruments with maturities at the date of purchase greater than ninety days are considered investments 
all instruments with maturities greater than one year from the balance sheet date are considered long term investments unless management intends to liquidate such securities in the current operating cycle 
such securities are classified as short term investments 
these securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
changes in value of these investments are primarily related to changes in interest rates and are considered to be temporary in nature 
except for declines in fair value that are not considered temporary  net unrealized gains or losses on these investments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
we recognize realized gains and losses upon sale of investments using the specific identification method 
fair value of financial instruments our estimates of fair value for assets and liabilities is based on a framework that establishes a hierarchy of the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available 
the disclosure of fair value estimates is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable 
in determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed  the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions 
the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows level unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that we have the ability to access 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets  or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable eg  interest rates  yield curves  default rates  etc 
or can be corroborated by observable market data 
level valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable 
the unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
revenue recognition our online search advertising revenue is composed of per click fees that we charge customers and profit sharing arrangements we enter with intermediaries 
the per click fee charged for keyword targeted listings is calculated based on the results of online bidding for keywords or page content  up to a maximum cost per keyword or page content set by the customer 
the company has profit sharing agreements with several customers that call for the sharing of profits and losses 
profit sharing arrangements are governed by contractual agreement 
revenue from these profit sharing agreements is reported net of the customer s share of profit 
revenue also includes revenue share from licensing of private labeled versions of our adcenter platform 
revenues associated with online advertising products  including advertiser networks  are generally recognized once collectability is established  delivery of services has occurred  all performance obligations have been satisfied  and no refund obligations exist 
we pay distribution network partners based on clicks on the advertiser s ad that are displayed on the websites of these distribution network partners 
these payments are called tac and are included in cost of revenue 
the revenue derived from these arrangements that involve traffic supplied by distribution network partners is reported gross of the payment to the distribution network partners 
this revenue is reported gross due to the fact that we are the primary obligor to the advertisers who are the customers of the advertising service 
we also enter into agreements to provide private labeled versions of our products  including licenses to the adcenter platform technology 
these license arrangements may include some or all of the following elements revenue sharing based on the publisher s customer s monthly revenue generated through the adcenter application  upfront fees  minimum monthly fees  and other license fees 
we recognize upfront fees over the term of the arrangement or the expected period of performance  other license fees over the term of the license  and revenue sharing portions over the period in which such revenue is earned 
in all cases  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service is performed  and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we provide a provision against revenue for estimated reductions resulting from billing adjustments and customer refunds 
the amounts of these provisions are evaluated periodically based upon customer experience and historical trends 

table of contents deferred revenue is recorded when payments are received in advance of performance in underlying agreements 
customer deposits are recorded when customers make prepayments for online advertising 
the company evaluates individual arrangements with customers to make a determination under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc revenue recognition 
we test and record revenue accordingly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers failing to make required payments 
this valuation allowance is reviewed and adjusted on a periodic basis 
the review is based on factors including the application of historical collection rates to current receivables and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts are considered and recorded if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than we anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as bankruptcy 
concentrations  credit risk and credit risk evaluation concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  investments  and accounts receivable 
as of december  and december   we placed our cash equivalents and investments through one financial institution  city national bank cnb  and mitigated the concentration of credit risk by placing percentage limits on the maximum portion of the investment portfolio which may be invested in any one investment instrument 
these amounts at times may exceed federally insured limits 
we have not experienced any credit losses on these cash equivalents and investment accounts and do not believe we are exposed to any significant credit risk on these funds 
the fair value of these accounts is subject to fluctuation based on market prices 
credit risk  customer and vendor evaluation accounts receivable are unsecured and are derived from sales to customers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
we apply judgment as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables based primarily on our evaluation of the customer s financial condition and past collection history and record a specific allowance 
in addition  we record an allowance based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
historically  such losses have been within our expectations 
revenue concentrations our largest category of customers is  and is expected to continue to be  intermediaries 
revenue from intermediary business declined approximately in the year ended december   as compared to the same period in  and has continued to decline in the first quarter of property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  except when an impairment analysis requires use of fair value  and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows computer equipment to years furniture and fixtures to years software to years leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the lease term 
when assets are retired or otherwise disposed of  the cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from their respective accounts  and any gain or loss on such sale or disposal is reflected in operating expenses 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures that substantially increase an asset s useful life are capitalized 
at december   the company determined that continuing losses associated with the use of long lived assets and a projection of associated future cash flows required the adjustment of long lived assets to fair market value at december  accordingly  long lived assets including capitalized software  computer equipment  furniture and fixtures  software and leasehold improvements with a recorded net book value of million were reduced to fair market value of million at december  
table of contents internal use software development costs we capitalize external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing and obtaining internal use computer software and the payroll and payroll related costs of employees who devote time to developing internal use computer software 
we exercise judgment in determining when costs related to a project may be capitalized  in assessing the ongoing value of the capitalized costs  and in determining the amortization period for the capitalized costs  which is generally years 
we expect to continue to invest in internally developed software 
restructuring charges in august  the company entered into an agreement to sublease its office space in san francisco under terms generally equivalent to its existing commitment 
the company had million in restructuring costs associated with the sub lease of the san francisco headquarters in the year ended december  in january  our board of directors approved a plan of termination that resulted in a reduction of the workforce of approximately full time positions  or approximately 
in the year ended december  the company recorded million in pre tax restructuring charges associated with this action 
all restructuring charges have been classified as such on the consolidated statement of operations 
traffic acquisition costs we enter into agreements of varying durations with our distribution network partners that display our listings ads on their sites in return for a percentage of the revenue per click that we receive when the ads are clicked on those partners sites 
we also enter into agreements of varying durations with third party affiliates 
these affiliate agreements provide for variable payments based on a percentage of our revenue or based on a certain metric  such as number of searches or paid clicks 
tac expense is recorded in cost of revenue 
advertising costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses as incurred 
product development costs of new product ideas and enhancements to existing products are charged to expense as incurred 
share based compensation we recognize share based compensation costs for all share based payment transactions  including grants of stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan  over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using the black scholes method 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense in our consolidated statement of operations over the requisite service periods 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is determined at the end of each fiscal quarter  based on historical rates 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we record liabilities  where appropriate  for all uncertain income tax positions 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within operations as income tax expense
