item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview income 
our primary source of income is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments  and interest expense  which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings 
other sources of income include earnings from customer service fees mostly from service charges on deposit accounts  bank owned life insurance  fees from investment management services and gains on the sale of securities 
provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level representing management s best estimate of inherent losses in the loan portfolio  based upon management s evaluation of the portfolio s collectibility 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged against income 
charge offs  if any  are charged to the allowance 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
allocation of the allowance may be made for specific loans or pools of loans  but the entire allowance is available for the entire loan portfolio 
expenses 
the noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and equipment  data processing  federal deposit insurance and other general and administrative expenses 
our noninterest expenses have increased as a result of operating as a public company 
these additional expenses consist primarily of stock related compensation  legal and accounting fees  expenses of stockholder communications and meetings and stock exchange listing fees 
salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees  payroll taxes  and expenses for health insurance  retirement plans and other employee benefits 
we will recognize additional annual employee compensation expenses stemming from the adoption of the employee stock ownership plan esop and the new equity incentive plan 
the actual amount of these new stock related compensation and benefit expenses are based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock or related stock options at specific points in the future 
occupancy and equipment expenses  which are the fixed and variable costs of buildings and equipment  consist primarily of depreciation charges  rental expenses  furniture and equipment expenses  maintenance  real estate taxes and costs of utilities 
depreciation of premises and equipment is computed using a straight line method based on the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from to years  or the expected lease terms  if shorter 
data processing expenses are the fees we pay to third parties for the use of their software and for processing customer information  deposits and loans 
federal deposit insurance premiums are payments we make to the federal deposit insurance corporation for insurance of our deposit accounts 
our contribution to the charitable foundation in connection with the bank s stock conversion was an additional operating expense that reduced net income during the first quarter of the contribution to the foundation resulted in a million after tax expense in the first quarter of this expense will not be a recurring expense 
other expenses include expenses for professional services  advertising  office supplies  postage  telephone  insurance and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
business strategy our primary objective is to operate and grow a profitable community oriented financial institution serving customers in our primary market areas 
we have sought to achieve this through the adoption of a business strategy designed to maintain a strong capital position and high asset quality 
our operating strategy includes the following increasing our deposit market share within wellesley  massachusetts and the surrounding communities 
since its inception in  wellesley bank has primarily served the town of wellesley  massachusetts and the immediate surrounding communities 
despite considerable competition from larger financial institutions with greater resources than wellesley bank  we have made significant progress in recent years to increase our market presence in the town of wellesley 
our deposits have increased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  at june  latest available  we had of the deposits in the town of wellesley  which represented the third largest market share out of financial institutions with branches in the town of wellesley 
we believe the wellesley market area will continue to provide us opportunities for growth  and we intend to continue to increase our market share in the town of wellesley through our third wellesley branch office that opened in april continuing to emphasize our commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loans  as well as increasing our commercial business depository relationships in our market area 
we have worked to increase our commercial relationships by diversifying our loan portfolio beyond residential mortgage loans and offering business deposit and checking products 
since december   our commercial real estate  construction and commercial business loan portfolio has increased million  or  and at december  was of our total loan portfolio 
in connection with the increase in our commercial business loan portfolio  we also have focused on providing a full banking relationship and  as a result  experienced an increase in our business deposit and checking accounts 
since december   our business deposit and checking accounts increased million  or  of which  million was attributable to the revised sweep account program  and at december   represented of our total deposits 
with the additional capital raised in the offering  we expect to continue to pursue the larger lending relationships associated with commercial real estate and construction lending 
in addition  we will continue to expand and develop our business deposit and checking products to better serve our commercial customers 
increasing our residential mortgage lending in our market area 
we believe there are significant opportunities to increase our residential mortgage lending in our market areas 
the town of wellesley and its surrounding communities has a sound economy and has not been as negatively affected by the recent recession as other regions of the united states 
as a result  the demand for residential mortgage loans in our market area  in particular larger jumbo loans  has not been significantly impacted by the downturn in the economy 
early in  we hired an additional residential mortgage lender to complement our existing residential mortgage lending operations  and have expanded our lending territory to include sections of boston in suffolk county and cambridge in middlesex county 
we believe this provides additional lending opportunities and further diversifies our residential loan portfolio 
continuing conservative underwriting practices while maintaining a high quality loan portfolio 
we believe that strong asset quality is a key to long term financial success 
we have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and manageable credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and by diligent monitoring and collection efforts 
nonperforming loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  at december   nonperforming loans were of the total loan portfolio and of total assets 
the decrease in nonperforming loans is the result of the payoff of certain troubled residential and commercial relationships and the return to performing status of one commercial real estate loan totaling million 
although we intend to increase our commercial real estate  construction and commercial business lending  we intend to continue our philosophy of managing large loan exposures through conservative loan underwriting and sound credit administration standards 
seeking to enhance fee income by growing investment advisory services 
our profits rely heavily on the spread between the interest earned on loans and securities and interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
in order to decrease our reliance on net interest income  we have pursued initiatives to increase noninterest income 
in particular  we offer a full array of investment advisory services for individuals  nonprofits  institutions  endowments  and other registered investment advisors through our wholly owned subsidiary  wellesley investment partners  llc  a registered investment advisor 
investment management fees relating to our investment advisory services totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we intend to continue to enhance our fee income through wellesley investment partners by continuously evaluating potential additional hires or acquisitions if appropriate 
emphasizing lower cost core deposits to maintain low funding costs 
we seek to increase net interest income by controlling costs of funding 
over the past several years  we have sought to reduce our dependence on traditional higher cost certificates of deposits in favor of stable lower cost demand deposits 
we have utilized additional product offerings  technology and a focus on customer service in working toward this goal 
in addition  we intend to seek demand deposits by growing commercial banking relationships 
core deposits demand  now  money market and savings accounts comprised of our total deposits at december   as compared to at december  and at december  critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions by management that have  or could have  a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income to be critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is established through the provision for loan losses  which is charged to income 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses necessarily involves a high degree of judgment 
among the material estimates required to establish the allowance are the likelihood of default  the loss exposure at default  the amount and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  the value of collateral  and the determination of loss factors to be applied to the various elements of the portfolio 
all of these estimates are susceptible to significant change 
management reviews the level of the allowance at least quarterly and establishes the provision for loan losses based upon an evaluation of the portfolio  past loss experience  current economic conditions and other factors related to the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary if economic or other conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation and massachusetts commissioner of banks  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize adjustments to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
a large loss could deplete the allowance and require increased provisions to replenish the allowance  which would adversely affect earnings 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this document 
deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
management reviews deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to identify any uncertainties pertaining to realization of such assets 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required against deferred tax assets  management assesses historical and forecasted operating results  including a review of eligible carryforward periods  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical estimate because the underlying assumptions can change from period to period 
for example  tax law changes or variances in future projected operating performance could result in a change in the valuation allowance 
should actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  the actual realization of net deferred tax assets could differ materially from the amounts recorded in the financial statements 
if we were not able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the related valuation allowance would be charged to income tax expense in the period such determination was made and could have a negative impact on earnings 
in addition  if actual factors and conditions differ materially from those used by management  we could incur penalties and interest imposed by taxing authorities

risk management overview 
managing risk is an essential part of successfully managing a financial institution 
our most prominent risk exposures are credit risk  interest rate risk  market risk and liquidity risk 
credit risk is the risk of not collecting the interest and or the principal balance of a loan or security when it is due 
interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income as a result of changes in interest rates 
market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments  such as available for sale securities that are recorded at fair value 
liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations to depositors  lenders or borrowers when due 
other risks that we face are operational risks and reputation risk 
operational risks include risks related to fraud  regulatory compliance  processing errors  technology and disaster recovery 
reputation risk is the risk that negative publicity or press  whether true or not  could cause a decline in our customer base or revenue 
credit risk management 
our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having well defined credit policies and uniform underwriting criteria and providing prompt attention to potential problem loans 
this strategy also emphasizes conservative loan to value ratios and guarantees of construction and commercial real estate loans by parties with substantial net worth 
in addition  during each calendar year  we engage an outside loan review firm to perform a thorough review of our loan portfolio 
this review involves analyzing all large borrowing relationships  delinquency trends and loan collateral valuation in order to identify impaired loans 
we do not originate interest only mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties nor do we offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal such as option arm loans where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on their loan 
additionally  we generally do not offer subprime loans loans that are made with low down payments to borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies  previous charge offs  judgments or bankruptcies  or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity or alt a loans loans to borrowers having less than full documentation 
when a borrower fails to make a required loan payment  management takes a number of steps to have the borrower cure the delinquency and restore the loan to current status 
management makes initial contact with the borrower when the loan becomes days past due 
if payment is not then received by the th day of delinquency  additional letters and phone calls generally are made  and a plan of collection is pursued for each individual loan 
a particular plan of collection may lead to foreclosure  the timing of which depends on the prospects for the borrower bringing the loan current  the financial strength and commitment of any guarantors  the type and value of the collateral securing the loan and other factors 
if a foreclosure action is instituted and the loan is not brought current  paid in full  or refinanced before the foreclosure sale  the real property securing the loan generally is sold at foreclosure 
we may consider loan workout arrangements with certain borrowers under certain circumstances  as well as the sale of the nonperforming loans 
management informs the board of directors on a monthly basis of the amount of loans delinquent more than days 
management also provides detailed reporting of loans greater than days delinquent  all loans in foreclosure and all foreclosed and repossessed property that we own 
analysis of nonperforming and classified assets 
we consider foreclosed assets  loans that are maintained on a nonaccrual basis and loans that are past days or more and still accruing to be nonperforming assets 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they are classified as impaired or when they become days or more past due 
loans are classified as impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that wellesley bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
at the time a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the accrual of interest ceases and interest income previously accrued on such loans is reversed against current period interest income 
payments received on a nonaccrual loan are first applied to the outstanding principal balance when collectability of principal is in doubt 
real estate that we acquire as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as real estate owned until it is sold 
when property is acquired it is recorded at the lower of its cost or fair market value at the date of foreclosure 
any holding costs and declines in fair value after acquisition of the property result in charges against income 
troubled debt restructurings occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower s financial difficulties 
these concessions may include  but are not limited to  modifications of the terms of the debt  the transfer of assets or the issuance of an equity interest by the borrower to satisfy all or part of the debt  or the substitution or addition of borrower s 
we will not return a troubled debt restructuring to accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make principal and interest payments under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months 
the following table provides information with respect to our nonperforming assets  including troubled debt restructurings  at the dates indicated 
we did not have any accruing loans past due days or more at the dates presented

income related to nonaccrual loans included in interest income for the years ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded for the years ended december  and had accruing troubled debt restructurings been current according to their original terms amounted to  and  respectively 
income related to accruing troubled debt restructurings included in interest income for the years ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
total nonperforming loans decreased from december  to december  as a result of the payoff of certain residential and commercial relationships and the return to performing status of one commercial real estate loan totaling million 
total nonperforming loans increased from december  to december  as a result of one residential and two commercial relationships which were identified as impaired due to deteriorating credit conditions specific to each borrower 
federal regulations require us to review and classify assets on a regular basis 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation and the massachusetts commissioner of banks have the authority to identify problem assets and  if appropriate  require them to be classified 
there are three classifications for problem assets substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets must have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted 
when management classifies an asset as substandard or doubtful  a specific allowance for loan losses may be established 
if management classifies an asset as loss  an amount equal to of the portion of the asset classified loss is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
the regulations also provide for a special mention category  described as assets that do not currently expose wellesley bank to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving wellesley bank s close attention 
wellesley bank also utilizes an eleven grade internal loan rating system for commercial real estate  construction and commercial loans to assist in evaluating individual loans and determining assets classifications 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table shows the aggregate amounts of our criticized and classified assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands special mention assets substandard assets doubtful assets loss assets total at december   and  none of the special mention loans were nonaccrual 
substandard assets at december  and december  consisted solely of nonaccrual loans while none of the substandard assets at december  included nonaccrual loans 
all doubtful assets in the table above consist of nonaccrual loans 
the decrease in loans classified as substandard in was due in part to a reduction in outstanding balances to two large borrowers and subsequent upgrading of our internal classification of another commercial relationship 
the increase in special mention assets in was the result of the addition of one commercial loan relationship with declining cash flow characteristics 
other than as disclosed in the above tables  there are no other loans where management has serious doubts about the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
delinquencies 
the following table provides information about delinquencies in our loan portfolio at the dates indicated 
at december  at december  in thousands days past due days past due days past due days past due days past due days past due real estate loans residential mortgage commercial real estate construction commercial loans consumer loans total at december  in thousands days past due days past due days past due real estate loans residential mortgage commercial real estate construction commercial loans consumer loans total the increase in delinquencies in is primarily attributable to deteriorating cash flow for certain commercial real estate loan customers 
several of these relationships were brought current during january analysis and determination of the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
we evaluate the need to establish allowances against losses on loans on a quarterly basis 
when additional allowances are necessary  a provision for loan losses is charged to earnings 
our methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses consists of an allocated component related to impaired loans  a general component related to the remainder of the loan portfolio  and an unallocated component related to overall uncertainties that could affect management s estimate of probable losses 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
allowance on impaired loans 
the allocated component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are individually evaluated and determined to be impaired 
the allowance for each impaired loan is determined by either the present value of expected future cash flows or  if the loan is collateral dependent  by the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell 
we identify a loan as impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
management evaluates loans other than smaller balance homogeneous loans for impairment 
if a loan is determined to be impaired  an individual loss assessment is performed to determine the probability of a loss and  if applicable  the estimated measurement of the loss 
smaller balance homogeneous loans  such as residential real estate loans and consumer loans  are generally excluded from an individual impairment analysis and are collectively evaluated by management to estimate losses inherent in those loans 
however  certain smaller balance homogeneous loans will be individually evaluated for impairment when they reach nonperforming status or become subject to a restructuring agreement 
allowance on the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the general component of the allowance for loan losses relates to loans that are not determined to be impaired 
management determines the appropriate loss factor for each group of loans with similar risk characteristics within the portfolio based on loss experience and qualitative and environmental factors for loans in each group 
loan categories will represent groups of loans with similar risk characteristics and may include types of loans categorized by product  large credit exposures  concentrations  loan grade  or any other characteristic that causes a loan s risk profile to be similar to another 
we consider qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our existing portfolio to differ from historical loss experience including changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  changes in experience  ability and depth of loan management  changes in the volume and severity of past due loans  nonaccrual loans and adversely graded or classified loans  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence of or changes in concentrations of credit  changes in economic or business conditions  and the effect of competition  legal and regulatory requirements on estimated credit losses 
our qualitative and environmental factors are reviewed on a quarterly basis and our historical loss experience is reviewed annually to ensure they are reflective of current conditions in our loan portfolio and economy 
unallocated allowance 
management maintains an unallocated component within the allowance for loan losses to cover uncertainties that could affect our overall estimate of probable losses 
this component recognizes the imprecision inherent in the assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating the allocated and general components of the allowance  and is generally not a significant component of the overall allowance 
we identify loans that may need to be charged off as a loss by reviewing all impaired loans and related loss analyses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when we believe the uncollectibility of the loan balance is confirmed 
a borrower s inability to make payments under the terms of the loan and a shortfall in collateral value would generally result in our charging off the loan to the extent of the loss deemed to be confirmed

furthermore  while we believe we have established our allowance for loan losses in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  there can be no assurance that the federal deposit insurance corporation and the massachusetts commissioner of banks  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not require us to increase our allowance for loan losses based on judgments different from ours 
in addition  because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty  there can be no assurance that the existing allowance for loan losses is adequate or that increases will not be necessary should the quality of any loans deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above 
any material increase in the allowance for loan losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation

we manage the interest rate sensitivity of our interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets in an effort to minimize the adverse effects of changes in the interest rate environment 
deposit accounts typically react more quickly to changes in market interest rates than mortgage loans because of the shorter maturities of deposits 
as a result  sharp increases in interest rates may adversely affect our earnings while decreases in interest rates may beneficially affect our earnings 
to reduce the potential volatility of our earnings  we have sought to improve the match between asset and liability maturities and rates  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk emphasizes originating adjustable rate loans for retention in our loan portfolio  selling in the secondary market substantially all newly originated conforming fixed rate residential mortgage loans  promoting core deposit products and short term time deposits  adjusting the maturities of borrowings and adjusting the investment portfolio mix and duration 
we currently do not participate in hedging programs  interest rate swaps or other activities involving the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have an asset liability committee  which includes members of management  to communicate  coordinate and control all aspects of asset liability management 
the committee establishes and monitors the volume  maturities  pricing and mix of assets and funding sources with the objective of managing assets and funding sources to provide results that are consistent with liquidity  growth  risk limits and profitability goals 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest and net income 
interest rate risk analysis 
we analyze our interest rate sensitivity position to manage the risk associated with interest rate movements through the use of interest income and equity simulations 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest sensitive 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
our goal is to manage asset and liability positions to moderate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income and the present value of our equity 
interest income and equity simulations are completed quarterly and presented to the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
the simulations provide an estimate of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and the present value of our equity under a range of assumptions 
the numerous assumptions used in the simulation process are reviewed by the asset liability committee on a yearly basis 
changes to these assumptions can significantly affect the results of the simulation 
the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the potential timing in the repricing of certain assets and liabilities when market rates change and the changes in spreads between different market rates 
the simulation analysis incorporates management s current assessment of the risk that pricing margins will change adversely over time due to competition or other factors 
simulation analysis is only an estimate of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time 
we continually review the potential effect changes in interest rates could have on the repayment of rate sensitive assets and funding requirements of rate sensitive liabilities 
the table below sets forth an approximation of our exposure as a percentage of estimated net interest income for the next month period using interest income and equity simulations 
the simulations use projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  on the basis of contractual maturities  anticipated repayments and scheduled rate adjustments 
prepayment rates can have a significant impact on the simulations 
because of the large percentage of loans we hold  rising or falling interest rates have a significant impact on the prepayment speeds of our earning assets that in turn affect the rate sensitivity position 
when interest rates rise  prepayments tend to slow 
when interest rates fall  prepayments tend to rise 
our asset sensitivity would be reduced if prepayments slow and would increase if prepayments accelerated 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates will approximate actual future mortgage backed security and loan repayment activity

liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term and long term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan repayments  maturities and sales of securities  borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds and prepayments on loans are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
management regularly adjusts our investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities  and the objectives of our interest rate risk and investment policies 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  interest bearing deposits in other banks  and debt securities 
the levels of these assets depend on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
securities classified as available for sale  whose aggregate market value exceeds cost  provide additional sources of liquidity and had a market value of million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow a total of approximately million in additional funds from the federal home loan bank of boston 
on december   we had million of borrowings outstanding  all of which were federal home loan bank of boston advances 
in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow million from the co operative central bank  and million from the federal reserve bank under a collateralized borrowing program  none of which was outstanding at that date 
at december   we had million in loan commitments outstanding  which included million in available lines of credit for individuals and corporate customers  and unadvanced funds on construction loans 
certificates of deposit due within one year of december  totaled million  or of certificates of deposit 
the large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers hesitancy to invest their funds for long periods 
if these maturing deposits are not renewed  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including other certificates of deposit and borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit 
management believes  however  based on past experience that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will be renewed 
we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
in addition  we believe that our branch network  which is presently comprised of three full service retail banking offices located in our primary market area  and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities  will afford us sufficient long term liquidity 
the following table presents certain of our contractual obligations as of december  december  payments due by period in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years contractual obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total financing and investing activities our primary investing activities are the origination of loans and the purchase of securities 
primary financing activities consist of transactions in deposit accounts and federal home loan bank borrowings 
deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us  local competitors  and other factors 
management generally manages the pricing of deposits to be competitive and to increase core deposit and customer relationships 
occasionally  management offers promotional rates on certain deposit products to attract deposits

we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal deposit insurance corporation and the massachusetts commissioner of banks  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at december   we exceeded all of our regulatory capital requirements 
we are considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
see regulation and supervision federal regulations capital requirements and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the capital from our offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources 
over time  the initial level of liquidity will be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes  including the funding of lending activities 
our financial condition and results of operations will be enhanced by the capital from the offering  resulting in increased net interest earning assets and income 
however  the large increase in equity resulting from the capital raised in the offering will  initially  have an adverse impact on our return on equity 
we may also use capital management tools such as cash dividends and common share repurchases to enhance stockholder value 
on october   the board of directors announced the repurchase of up to  shares  or approximately of the company s outstanding stock 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in our financial statements 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
for information about our loan commitments and unused lines of credit  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  we did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion of the impact of recent accounting pronouncements  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  which require the measurement of financial positions and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short term and long term interest rates 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than do general levels of inflation 
although inflation expectations do affect interest rates  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services
