item properties 
we conduct our retail vehicle operations in two basic formats production and non production superstores 
production superstores are those locations at which vehicle reconditioning is performed 
production superstores have more service bays and require additional space for work in process inventory and  therefore  are generally larger than non production stores 
in determining whether to construct a production or a non production superstore on a given site  we take several factors into account  including the anticipated long term regional reconditioning needs and the available acreage of the sites in that market 
as a result  some superstores that are constructed to accommodate reconditioning activities may initially be operated as non production superstores until we expand our presence in that market 
as of february   we operated production superstores and non production superstores 
as of february   we operated wholesale auctions  most of which were located at production superstores 
stores at which auctions are conducted generally have additional space to store wholesale inventory 
as of february   we also operated one new car store  which was located adjacent to our used car superstore in laurel  maryland 
our remaining three new car franchises are operated as part of our used car superstores 
production superstores are generally  to  square feet on to acres  but a few range from  to  square feet on to acres 
non production superstores are generally  to  square feet on to acres

we owned the remaining stores currently in operation 
we also owned our home office building in richmond  virginia  and land associated with planned future store openings 
expansion since opening our first used car superstore in  we have grown organically  through the construction and opening of company operated stores 
we do not franchise our operations 
as of february   we operated used car superstores in us markets  which represented approximately of the us population 
we believe that further geographic expansion and additional fill in opportunities in existing markets will provide a foundation for future sales and earnings growth 
in december  we temporarily suspended store growth due to the weak economic and sales environment 
we resumed store growth in fiscal  opening superstores that year  superstores in fiscal and superstores in fiscal we currently plan to open superstores in fiscal and between and in each of the following fiscal years

item legal proceedings 
on april   mr 
john fowler filed a putative class action lawsuit against carmax auto superstores california  llc and carmax auto superstores west coast  inc in the superior court of california  county of los angeles 
subsequently  two other lawsuits  leena areso et al 
v 
carmax auto superstores california  llc and justin weaver v 
carmax auto superstores california  llc  were consolidated as part of the fowler case 
the allegations in the consolidated case involved failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof  failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks and overtime  failure to pay overtime  failure to comply with itemized employee wage statement provisions  unfair competition  and california s labor code private attorney general act 
the putative class consisted of sales consultants  sales managers  and other hourly employees who worked for the company in california from april   to the present 
on may   the court dismissed all of the class claims with respect to the sales manager putative class 
on june   the court dismissed all claims related to the failure to comply with the itemized employee wage statement provisions 
the court also granted carmax motion for summary adjudication with regard to carmax alleged failure to pay overtime to the sales consultant putative class 
the plaintiffs appealed the court ruling regarding the sales consultant overtime claim 
on may   the california court of appeal affirmed the ruling in favor of carmax 
the plaintiffs filed a petition of review with the california supreme court  which was denied 
as a result  the plaintiffs overtime claims are no longer a part of the lawsuit 
the claims currently remaining in the lawsuit regarding the sales consultant putative class are failure to provide meal and rest breaks or compensation in lieu thereof  failure to pay wages of terminated or resigned employees related to meal and rest breaks  unfair competition  and california s labor code private attorney general act 
on june   the court entered a stay of these claims pending the outcome of a california supreme court case involving unrelated third parties but related legal issues 
subsequently  carmax moved to lift the stay and compel the plaintiffs remaining claims into arbitration on an individual basis  which the court granted on november  the plaintiffs appealed the court s ruling to the california court of appeal 
on march   the california court of appeal reversed the trial court order granting carmax motion to compel arbitration 
carmax intends to pursue an appeal of this decision 
the fowler lawsuit seeks compensatory and special damages  wages  interest  civil and statutory penalties  restitution  injunctive relief and the recovery of attorneys fees 
we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these matters 
we are involved in various other legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
based upon our evaluation of information currently available  we believe that the ultimate resolution of any such proceedings will not have a material adverse effect  either individually or in the aggregate  on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
