company overview meetme is a social network for meeting new people that makes meeting new people fun through social games and applications 
the meetme service  both on the web and in its mobile applications on iphone  android  ipad and other tablets  includes a combination of traditional social networking features eg profiles  messaging  friend lists and unique social discovery applications that facilitate interactions among users and encourage users to connect with each other 
an example of such an application is the live feed  a location based news feed that displays text  photo  and video posts of users geographically proximate to the viewing user 
through the live feed and other features like photoboard  locals  and match  users are able to discover relevant people around them 
once users connect through such a feature  some portion of those users will take other actions with respect to particular users  including viewing their profiles and sending them messages 
the platform s health is a function of its number of active users  the number of new users joining per day  and the average revenue per user 
highlights to the extent that the metric data presented below contains the entire year of  it combines the pre acquisition period  january to november   with the post merger data 
we averaged million monthly active users maus on the core meetme platform in the fourth quarter of  an increase of as compared to million average maus on the core meetme platform in the fourth quarter of we averaged million daily active users daus on the core meetme platform in the fourth quarter of  an increase of as compared to million average daus on the core meetme platform in the fourth quarter of we averaged million maus of our mobile products in the fourth quarter of  an increase of as compared to million average maus of our mobile products in the fourth quarter of we averaged million daus of our mobile products in the fourth quarter of  an increase of as compared to million average daus of our mobile products in the fourth quarter of our highly engaged user base generated over billion total page views in  up from the billion page views in the same period of for the meetme platforms 
in march  we launched a paid virtual currency product in our mobile apps  credits  representing our first initiative toward monetizing our rapidly growing mobile audience through in app purchases 
revenue attributed to our mobile products was million in the fourth quarter of  an increase of as compared to million in the fourth quarter of  with of mobile revenue in the fourth quarter of attributed to virtual currency 
mobile average revenue per daily active user arpdau increased from to during the same period 
as of october   our consumer properties were combined under a single brand  meetme 
this transition of our legacy quepasa 
com users onto the meetme platform marked the final step of the merger integration that began on november   when quepasa corporation merged with insider guides  inc we successfully internationalized the core meetme platform  launching in spanish and portuguese in august  and expanding to french  german  and italian in december and to traditional chinese  japanese  and russian in february as a result of these launches  of our maus in december came from outside the united states and canada  as compared to of our maus coming from outside the united states and canada in june factors affecting our performance number of maus and daus we believe ability to grow web and mobile maus and daus affects our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of advertisements we are able to show  the value of those ads  and the volume of virtual currency purchases  as well as our expenses and capital expenditures 
user engagement changes in user engagement patterns we believe also affect our revenue and financial performance 
specifically  the number of visits and page views each mau or dau generates affects the number of advertisements we are able to display and therefore the rate at which we are able to monetize our active user base 
we continue to create new features and enhance existing features to drive additional engagement 
platform trends increasing use of meetme on mobile devices may affect our revenue and financial results  as we currently display fewer ads on average to mobile users compared to users on personal computers  and we earn less revenue per ad impression as a result of the mobile advertising market being less established than the web advertising market 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  over of our daus on average accessed meetme on mobile devices  yet we generated only of our core platform revenue from our mobile usage 
improving the rate at which we monetize our growing mobile traffic is a key priority in  as we expect our users to continue to shift their usage from web to mobile for the foreseeable future 
the transition in our user access to mobile may impact revenues negatively in the short term and medium term as mobile monetization continues to mature slowly 
advertising rates similar to many other publishers  the revenue we earn per thousand ad impressions cpm on the web is on a downward trend  while cpm in our mobile applications has been rising  but remains significantly lower as compared to the web 
our revenue and financial results are materially dependent on these broader industry trends  and to the extent cpm continues declining on the web and is not offset by the rising cpm on mobile  our operating results may be impacted 
we expect to continue investing in new types of advertising and new placements  especially in our mobile applications 
additionally  we are prioritizing initiatives that generate revenue directly from users  including new virtual currency products and a premium subscription product  in part to reduce our dependency on advertising revenue 
user geography the geography of our users influences our revenue and financial results because we currently monetize users in distinct geographies at varying average rates 
for example  arpu in the united states and canada is significantly higher than in latin america 
in and early  we laid the foundation for future international growth by localizing the core meetme service into five additional languages with a focus on western europe and three additional languages with a focus on asia 
we plan to continue to invest in user growth across the world  including in geographies where current per user monetization rates are relatively lower than in the united states and canada 
new user sources the percentage of our new users that are acquired through inorganic  paid sources has a material impact on our financial performance  specifically with regard to arpu for web and mobile 
inorganically acquired users tend to have lower engagement rates  tend to generate fewer visits and ad impressions and to be less likely to buy virtual currency products 
when paid marketing campaigns are ongoing  our overall usage and traffic increases due to the influx of inorganically acquired users  but the rate at which we monetize the average active user overall declines as a result 
ad inventory management our revenue trends are affected by advertisement inventory management changes affecting the number  size  or prominence of advertisements we display 
in general  more prominently displayed advertising units will generate more revenue per impression 
our social theater campaign expenses are materially dependent on the percentage of social theater campaigns that run on meetme 
com and the percentage that run on our partners cross platform networks 
we work to maximize the share of social theater campaigns that run on meetme 
com and run campaigns on our partners networks only when necessary to increase their reach 
increased social theater competition a significant portion of the revenue generated by the social theater is derived from advertising campaigns  powered by social theater technology  that run on our partners cross platform networks and not on meetme 
com 
a recent increase in competitors offering similar technology solutions  and in some cases their own cross platform distribution networks  may make it difficult to compete on price and win business 
we expect this downward pressure on price to continue and impact our operating results in the future 
seasonality advertising spending is traditionally seasonal with a peak in the fourth quarter of each year 
we believe that this seasonality in advertising spending affects our quarterly results  which generally reflect a growth in advertising revenue between the third and fourth quarters and a decline in advertising spending between the fourth and subsequent first and second quarters of each year 
headcount our employee headcount decreased during as a result of termination related to process re engineering and discontinued operations 
we expect to leverage and supplement our current talent pool through managed growth 
we intend to hire additional software engineers  other personnel with technology expertise  and sales personnel to support domestic and international expansion 
growth trends in web and mobile maus and daus are critical variables that affect our revenue and financial results by influencing the number of advertisements we are able to show  the value of those ads  the volume of payments transactions  as well as our expenses and capital expenditures 
changes in user engagement patterns from web to mobile and international diversification also affect our revenue and financial performance 
we believe that overall engagement as measured by the percentage of users who create content such as status posts  messages  or photos or generate feedback increases as our user base grows 
we continue to create new apps and enhance existing apps to lift social sharing and increase monetization 
the launch of additional languages to the platform facilitates international user growth 
we believe our revenue trends are also affected by advertisement inventory management changes affecting the number  size  or prominence of advertisements we display and traditional seasonality 
social theater is a revenue product for the meetme platform and on third party sites 
social theater growth may be affected by large brand penetration  the ability to grow the advertiser base and advertiser spending budgets 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries  quepasa 
com de mexico  quepasa servi os em solucoes de publicidade e tecnologia ltda inactive  meetme online s s ltda formerly quepasa games s s ltda from march   and insider guides  inc formerly known as ig acquisition company from november  until it merged into meetme  inc effective january  
on june  the company discontinued its game development and hosting operations 
accordingly  games operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
most significant estimates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the allowance on accounts receivable  valuation of notes receivable  valuation of deferred tax assets  valuation of stock based award for employees and non employees  valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  evaluating goodwill and long lived assets for impairment  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  and the measurement and accrual of restructuring costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable allowances we maintain an allowance for potential credit losses and for potential discounts based on historical experience and other information available to management 
discounts historically represent less than of the related revenues 
the fees associated with display advertising are often based on impressions  which are created when the ad is viewed 
the amount of impressions often differs between tracking systems  resulting in discounts on some payments 
we have hundreds of customers that advertise on thousands of publishers  and it is not possible for all of the parties to agree to designate a single standardized system for measuring impressions 
differences between ad serving platforms with respect to impressions is primarily due to lag time between serving of ads and other technical differences 
for example in the publisher s platform an impression might be counted as soon as the web page opens  however  if the user were to close his or her web browser window as soon as the page is rendered  that impression data might not be counted by the advertisers tracking system  nor would the advertiser consider it a valid impression 
the discounts would be determined by taking the difference in impressions between the two tracking systems and applying the appropriate cpm cost per thousand that the impressions were being served  so if we agreed to a cpm of with an advertiser  and we reported  impressions  and the advertiser had  impressions  the discount would be calculated as follows  impressions divided by  multiplied by to come up with a discount of 
concentration of credit risk during the year ended december   customers and comprised approximately and of total revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december   and customer  a principal shareholder of the company  matt inc and its parent company  comprised   and  respectively  of total revenues 
three customers comprised and of total accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively 
our advertising revenue is a combination of two components  remnant advertising sales  and social theater campaigns 
social theater campaigns may produce individually significant revenue based upon the timing of the delivery of the campaign 
the company integrates sales with aggregators for remnant internet advertising that represent thousands of different clients 
there are many of these aggregators that could provide similar sources of advertising revenue 
our business is not dependent on any one or a few major customers  however our advertising revenue composition may result in significant customer concentrations due to the timing of large social theater campaigns and advertising aggregators 
goodwill goodwill is subject to impairment tests on an annual basis or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
goodwill is evaluated using specific methods  including potentially  a discounted cash flows method to determine the fair value of a reporting unit and comparison of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
the analysis necessarily involves significant management judgment to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  determined by conducting a valuation  then the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
management initially performs a qualitative assessment of goodwill to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value including goodwill 
in the event facts and circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  the goodwill carrying value will be reduced to its implied fair value through a charge to operating expenses 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including legal costs and restructuring costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as facts concerning contingencies become known we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the consolidated financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters that are subject to change as events evolve and additional information becomes available 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements which will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates and laws 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that  based on available evidence  is more likely than not to be realized 
dividends we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business  and we do not expect to declare or pay any dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value recognition provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
the fair values of share based payments are estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model  based on weighted average assumptions 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock 
we have elected to use the simplified method described in the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin topic c to estimate the expected term of employee stock options 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
revenue sources and recognition during the years ended december   and  our revenue was generated from two principal sources revenue earned from the sales of advertising on our websites and virtual currency products 
advertising revenue advertising and custom sponsorship revenues consist primarily of advertising fees earned from the display of advertisements and click throughs on text based links on our websites 
revenue from online advertising is recognized as impressions are delivered 
an ad impression refers to an image or video placed with the web page or mobile screen to promote a product or company 
an ad impression is delivered when an advertisement appears on pages viewed by members 
revenue from the display of click throughs on text based links is recognized as click throughs occur 
consistent with gaap  we recognize advertising revenue from customers that are advertising networks on a net basis  while advertising revenues earned directly from advertisers are recognized on a gross basis 
sponsorship revenue is recognized over the time period in which the sponsorship on the website occurs 
approximately  and of our revenue came from advertising during the years ended december   and  respectively 
virtual currency products revenue revenue is earned from virtual currency monetization products sold to our website users 
the company offers credits and lunch money as virtual currency to our platform users 
users buy lunch money and credits to purchase the company s virtual products which put them in the spotlight  helping to get more attention from the community and thereby meet more people faster on our platform 
these virtual products are consumed immediately 
lunch money is virtual currencies purchased using paypal by our users to buy premium virtual products on our platform 
credits can be purchased using paypal on the website and mobile applications and have a value of credits to 
platform users do not own the credits but have limited right to use the credits on virtual products offered for sale on the company s platform 
credits are non refundable  we may change the purchase price of credits at any time  and we reserve the right to stop issuing credits in the future 
the company s virtual currencies are not transferable  cannot be sold or exchanged outside our platform  are not redeemable for any sum of money  and can only be used for virtual products sold on our platform 
lunch money is purchased by users and used and recorded as revenue immediately 
credits are recorded in deferred revenue when purchased and recorded as revenue when used 
for vip and other subscriptions based products  the company recognizes revenue over the one month period of the subscription 
the company also earns revenue from advertisement products from currency engagement actions ie sponsored engagement advertisements by users on all of our platforms  including cost per action cpa currency incented promotions and sales on our proprietary cross platform currency monetization product  social theater 
the company controls and develops the social theater product and cpa promotions and acts as a principal in these transactions and recognizes the related revenue on a gross basis when collections are reasonably assured and upon delivery of the virtual currency to the user s account 
when a user performs an action  the user earns virtual currency and the company earns product revenue from the advertiser 
social theater is a product that allows us to offer advertisers a way to leverage the facebook platform through guaranteed actions by facebook s user base 
social theater is also hosted on the company s platform 
typical guaranteed actions available to advertisers are video views  fan page growth  quizzes and surveys 
social theatre revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonable assured  and the service has been rendered 
the social theater prices are both fixed and determinable based on the contract with the advertiser 
the user completes an action and the electronic record of the transaction triggers the revenue recognition 
the collection of the social theater revenue is reasonably assured by contractual obligation and historical payment performance 
the delivery of virtual currency from the hosting platform to a user evidences the completion of the action required by the customer that the service has been rendered for social theater revenue recognition 
we pay a distribution fee to the hosting platform when social theater is distributed outside of our platform and mobile applications 
social theater is classified as virtual currency product revenue  since users earn virtual currency every time they complete a social theater engagement  although we earn product revenue from the advertiser 
effective november in connection with the merger with myyearbook  the company s dsm product became a part of social theater  a cross platform  virtual currency product 
approximately of our revenue came from virtual currency product revenues during the year ended december  approximately and of our revenue came from social theater cross platform dsm campaigns during the years ended december  and operating expenses our principal operating expenses are divided into the following categories sales and marketing expenses our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  and non cash share based compensation for our employees engaged in sales  sales support  and marketing

in addition our general and administrative expenses include outside consulting  legal and accounting services  and facilities and other supporting overhead costs 
depreciation and amortization expenses our depreciation and amortization are non cash expenses which have consisted primarily of depreciation and amortization related to our property and equipment  and intangible assets 
currently the majority of our depreciation and amortization expense is attributable to tangible and intangible assets associated with the acquisition of myyearbook 
acquisition and restructuring costs acquisition and restructuring costs  include costs incurred related to the business acquisitions made by the company and costs incurred in conjunction with the restructuring of the company s business processes 
acquisition costs include the fees for broker commissions  investment banking  legal  accounting and other professional services  proxy  printing and filing costs  and travel costs incurred by the company during the acquisition process 
restructuring costs include employee termination and relocation costs recorded as incurred  and exit costs for the office closures 
other income expense other income expense consists primarily of interest earned  interest expense and earned grant income 
we have invested our cash in aaa rated  fully liquid instruments 
interest income relates to our notes receivable discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements and our cash balances 
interest expense relates to our loan and notes payable discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
earned grant income represents the amortized portion of a cash grant received from the mexican government for approved capital expenditures 
the grant is being recognized on a straight line basis over the useful lives of the purchased assets 
discontinued operations from quepasa games on june   the company discontinued its games development and hosting operations 
accordingly games operations have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
game revenue was recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price was fixed or determinable  collectability was reasonable assured  and the service was rendered 
for the purpose of determining when the service had been provided to the player  we determined an implied obligation existed to the paying player to continue displaying the purchased virtual items within the online game of a paying player over their estimated life 
the virtual goods were categorized as either consumable or durable 
consumable goods represent goods that are consumed immediately by a specific player action and have no residual value 
revenue from consumable goods was recognized at the time of sale 
durable goods add to the player s game environment over the playing period 
durable items  that otherwise do not have a limitation on repeated use  were recorded as deferred revenue at time of sale and recognized as revenue ratably over the estimated average playing period of a paying player 
for these items  the company considered the average playing period that the paying players typically play the game  to be months 
if we did not have the ability to differentiate revenue attributable to durable virtual goods from the consumable virtual goods for the specific game  we recognized revenue on the sale of the virtual goods for the game ratably over the estimated average playing period that paying players typically play the game 
any adjustments arising from changes in the average playing period would have been applied prospectively on the basis that such changes are caused by new information indicating a change in the game player behavior patterns 
as the company controlled the game process and acted as a principal in the transaction  revenue for internally developed games was recognized on a gross basis from sales proceeds reported by pay aggregators which were net of payment rejections  charge backs and reversals 
games expenses represented the direct expenses for hosting  marketing  site fees  reporting and foreign taxes 
games product development and content expenses included salaries  benefits  and share based compensation for our employees  utility charges  and production office costs  were charged to discontinuing operations as incurred 
game exit costs included severance costs of terminated employees and exit costs of office closure expenses and were charged to discontinuing operations as incurred

non gaap financial measure the following discussion and analysis includes both financial measures in accordance with gaap  as well as a non gaap financial measure 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
non gaap financial measures should be viewed as supplemental to  and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  operating income  and cash flow from operating activities  liquidity or any other financial measures 
they may not be indicative of the historical operating results of the company nor is it intended to be predictive of potential future results 
investors should not consider non gaap financial measures in isolation or as substitutes for performance measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
we believe that both management and shareholders benefit from referring to the following non gaap financial measure in planning  forecasting and analyzing future periods 
our management uses this non gaap financial measure in evaluating its financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period to period comparison 
our management uses and relies on the following non gaap financial measure the company defines adjusted ebitda as earnings or loss from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  amortization of stock based compensation  nonrecurring acquisition  restructuring or other expenses and goodwill impairment charges 
the company excludes stock based compensation because it is non cash in nature 
our management believes adjusted ebitda is an important measure of our operating performance because it allows management  investors and analysts to evaluate and assess our core operating results from period to period after removing the impact of acquisition related costs  and other items of a non operational nature that affect comparability 
our management recognizes that adjusted ebitda has inherent limitations because of the excluded items 
we have included a reconciliation of our non gaap financial measure to the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
we believe that providing the non gaap financial measure  together with the reconciliation to gaap  helps investors make comparisons between the company and other companies 
in making any comparisons to other companies  investors need to be aware that companies use different non gaap measure to evaluate their financial performance 
investors should pay close attention to the specific definition being used and to the reconciliation between such measure and the corresponding gaap measure provided by each company under applicable sec rules 
the following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss from continuing operations allocable to common shareholders  a gaap financial measure for the years ended december  net loss from continuing operations allocable to common shareholders interest expense depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense loss contingency for lawsuit settlements acquisition and restructuring costs adjusted ebitda loss new accounting pronouncements see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for discussion of recent accounting pronouncements
