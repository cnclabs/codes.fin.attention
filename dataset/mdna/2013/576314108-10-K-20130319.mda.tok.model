table of contents part i item business 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for serious or life threatening diseases with significant unmet needs 
we are leveraging our molecular adhesion sealant technology  or mast  platform  derived from over two decades of clinical  nonclinical and manufacturing experience with purified and non purified poloxamers  to develop mst for diseases and conditions characterized by microcirculatory insufficiency endothelial dysfunction and or impaired blood flow 
we believe the pharmacologic effects of mst support its development in more than one setting and we intend to develop mst in multiple clinical indications  both independently and through collaborations 
in january  we initiated epic evaluation of purified in children  a pivotal phase study of mst in sickle cell disease 
in february  we announced our plans to develop mst for complications of arterial disease  initially as an adjunct to thrombolytics in acute limb ischemia  and that in late or early we intend to initiate a phase  clinical proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mst in this indication 
additionally  we plan to conduct certain nonclinical studies to investigate the safety and or efficacy of mst in additional indications  including resuscitation of shock following major trauma and acute decompensated heart failure 
however  even if these nonclinical studies are positive  it is unlikely we will initiate clinical studies in these indications without a strategic collaboration or funding from the us government 
we may evaluate mst in other conditions in which its pharmacologic effects may translate into improved clinical outcomes 
over the past several years  we have changed fundamentally our priorities  personnel and business focus 
in  substantially all of the business operations of our company had been suspended and there were only two employees 
a restructuring process was implemented that year and  as a result  we now have a substantially new board of directors and management team  which terminated development of our prior reformulated chemotherapeutic programs  raised capital to fund our current strategic direction  acquired mst and focused our resources on its development  and managed substantial internal growth 
to reflect this fundamental change in our company  effective march   we changed our name from adventrx pharmaceuticals  inc to mast therapeutics  inc we are a development stage company and have not yet marketed or sold any products or generated any significant revenue 
business strategy our goal is to be a successful biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for serious or life threatening diseases with significant unmet needs 
near term activities that underlie our business strategy include the following complete the phase study and seek regulatory approval of mst in sickle cell disease 
our top priority is enrolling subjects in our phase study of mst in sickle cell disease 
although predicting the rate of enrollment for epic is subject to a number of assumptions and the actual rate may differ materially  we expect to complete enrollment in if study results are positive  we plan to submit a new drug application  or nda  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  based in large part on the data from this study 

table of contents develop mst for complications of arterial disease 
data from experimental models demonstrate the potential for mst  when used alone or in combination with thrombolytics  to improve outcomes in patients experiencing complications of arterial disease resulting from atherosclerotic and thromboembolic processes 
we believe that  based on the similar pathophysiology of atherosclerotic arterial disease plaque obstructed arteries reducing the flow of blood to tissue  an agent that is effective in one form of occlusive arterial disease also may be effective in its other manifestations 
our strategy in arterial disease is first to demonstrate the utility of mst in patients with acute limb ischemia  or ali  an advanced form of atherosclerosis  where we believe the potential to demonstrate a treatment effect is greatest 
by generating clinical proof of concept data in ali  we believe we increase development and partnering opportunities in other forms of occlusive arterial disease 
our near term goals include obtaining orphan drug designation for mst for ali  soliciting fda input on a planned phase  clinical proof of concept study in ali  and initiating the phase study in late or early with relatively modest investment  we expect to generate clinical proof of concept data in a relatively short period of time 
we plan to leverage the data generated in the planned phase study in ali to find a partner to develop mst in larger market indications within arterial disease  such as ischemic stroke 
secure funding from the us government to develop mst for resuscitation of shock following major trauma  or other trauma conditions 
the potential clinical benefits of mst in hemorrhagic shock are suggested by the results of a variety of experimental models  including statistically significant improvements in survival 
if the survival advantage observed in experimental models can be demonstrated in clinical studies  it would represent a multi billion dollar opportunity and a significant benefit to both civilian and military populations 
we plan to conduct additional nonclinical studies this year to support the development of mst in resuscitation of shock following trauma 
we also plan to seek funding from the us government to conduct a dose finding  phase  clinical proof of concept study in that indication  the protocol for which already has been developed in collaboration with a leading university in the research and care of trauma patients 
establish partnerships to accelerate the development of mst in multiple jurisdictions and indications 
we are focused on developing mst in the us and plan to seek partners to develop and commercialize mst outside of the us collaborating with companies with country specific development  regulatory and commercial expertise will enhance the overall value of mst and allow us to remain focused on our core competencies  which are in us markets 
in addition  establishing partnerships outside of the us  whether on an indication or product basis  will help fund development of mst in sickle cell disease  ali and other indications within the us the mast platform the mast platform describes the repository of both proprietary to us and non proprietary poloxamer related data  know how and other information that has been developed over the course of several decades by numerous sponsors  most recently by our company 
it reflects the accumulated knowledge of over pharmacology studies  more than clinical studies in multiple indications in which over  subjects have been exposed to both purified and non purified poloxamer  and over two decades of experience manufacturing and purifying poloxamers 
this knowledge  and those aspects that are proprietary to us in particular  provide us with unique insight into the mechanism of action of  and areas of potential clinical benefit with  mst the mast platform provides us with several key benefits as we develop mst in particular  we believe it accelerates development of mst in new indications  at reduced cost 
proof of concept in pharmacologic studies or experimental models has been demonstrated in a wide range of diseases and conditions and  for most new indications we plan to pursue  we believe we will not need to re conduct many of the preclinical activities that consume substantial time and resources in drug development eg  ind enabling toxicology  pharmacokinetic  absorption distribution metabolism excretion studies 
further  we already have evaluated mst in healthy volunteers and a study to evaluate its effect on cardiac ventricular repolarization is underway 
furthermore  we already have successfully manufactured clinical trial material 
as a result  we expect to move mst directly into phase studies and generate clinical proof of concept data in new indications in relatively short time frames with relatively modest investment 
by leveraging already completed pre clinical and phase clinical activities  we can focus on later stage  higher value activities  as well as save time and money both in terms of the costs to conduct these activities and by maintaining a more streamlined infrastructure 

table of contents provides broad based  indication agnostic exclusivity for mst we have filed for patent protection and continue to develop patent positions that we expect will provide exclusivity around the use of mst in new indications and in combination with other therapies 
in addition  the mast platform allows us to augment our proprietary position around broadly applicable  indication agnostic activities that we believe will provide additional barriers to entry for mst competitors 
for example  for macromolecules such as mst  acceptance criteria for starting materials and in process and release specifications are critical to the quality of drug product 
without these proprietary specifications  we believe competitors will be unable to manufacture products that are equivalent to mst in the manner that regulatory agencies will require and  therefore  will be required to invest in and take the time to conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of their follow on products 
we also are evaluating the use of proprietary analytical standards and bioanalytical assays to further augment our control over product quality  as well as developing our own proprietary process for manufacturing api starting material  which we expect would further enhance our proprietary position around mst without regard to indication 
increases partnering interest in and value of mst we believe that we increase our ability to attract collaborators by pursuing multiple development programs within the mst franchise and  if advantageous  partnering different indications in different jurisdictions 
we intend to structure all partnering transactions  whether indication or product based and whether regional or global  to ensure that we realize the financial benefit of the development  regulatory and commercial success of mst  regardless of the partnered indication  including through milestones  accelerating tiered royalties and  possibly  contingent value rights 
reduces our overall risk profile 
pursuing multiple development programs reduces the risk associated with any one program  assuming mst has an acceptable safety profile in each indication 
importantly  this diversification can be achieved without the costs typically associated with product pipeline expansion 
by leveraging the mast platform to move mst directly into phase studies  we expect to be able to expand into new indications without the time  expense and distraction needed to identify  negotiate and acquire new product candidates 
mst we are leveraging the mast platform to develop mst mst is formulated using a purified form of poloxamer substantial research has demonstrated that poloxamer  the active ingredient in mst  has cytoprotective and hemorheologic properties and inhibits inflammatory processes and thrombosis 
as described below  purified poloxamer was designed to preserve the activity but eliminate certain impurities and other substances that we believe were the cause of the acute renal dysfunction observed in clinical studies of non purified poloxamer conducted by a prior sponsor 
composition and proposed mechanism of action the active ingredient in mst is poloxamer  a nonionic  block copolymer comprised of a central linear chain of hydrophobic polyoxypropylene flanked on both sides by linear hydrophilic polyoxyethylene chains 
the activity of mst is not based on specific receptor ligand binding interactions  which are the mechanistic bases for most drugs 
rather  its binding activity and pharmacologic effects are driven by hydrophobic adhesive interactions 
the cell membrane is comprised predominantly of lipids and proteins 
the fundamental structure of the cell membrane is a phospholipid bilayer that forms a fluid  yet stable  selectively permeable barrier between the aqueous environments of both the cell interior and exterior 
the exterior surface of healthy cell membranes normally is hydrophilic  comprised of the polar head groups of lipid molecules that bury their hydrophobic tails in the interior of the bilayer 
when a cell membrane is damaged  the interior hydrophobic regions of the lipid bilayer become exposed 

table of contents the cell membrane serves many functions  but one of its primary roles is to regulate the passage of ions and large molecules into and out of the cell and  in particular  to maintain critical transmembrane ion concentrations 
damaged cell membranes result in increased diffusion of ions between the intracellular and extracellular environments 
the integrity of a cell membrane can be compromised by chemical agents eg  air pollutants  free radicals  poisons  physical trauma eg  electric shock  frostbite  radiation  thermal burns  hypovolemia and disease 
cells have evolved endogenous mechanisms for membrane repair  but membrane injury can exceed the cell s natural repair capacity 
if the damage is not repaired  cell ion pumps become overwhelmed and subsequently deplete the cell s energy stores  leading to cell death 
after intravenous administration  the mst hydrophobic polyoxypropylene core is believed to adhere to hydrophobic domains on cell membranes  which  as described above  become exposed when the membrane is damaged 
at sites of adhesion  it physically occupies the available area  minimizing or preventing other hydrophobic adhesive interactions  while displacing water and causing lipid molecules to pack more tightly  effectively sealing the damaged area and arresting unchecked transport of ions across the membrane 
mst does not bond covalently with the cell membrane and the adhesive interaction is reversible 
if the phospholipid density is restored  the physical adhesion may be reversed and mst dislodges from the cell membrane and returns to circulation 
while mst adheres specifically to hydrophobic domains  these domains may be widespread in sick or injured patients 
as a result  mst s activity broadly targets hydrophobic domains  without regard to the cause of the underlying damage  and  as described below  simultaneously may resolve multiple pathophysiologic processes 
at the same time  mst has demonstrated little or no affinity for hydrophilic domains and  thus  does not adhere to healthy cells 
pharmacodynamics mst is believed to exert multiple pharmacologic effects as a result of its adhesion to hydrophobic domains 
first  it protects cells by interrupting the pathological cascade associated with cell membrane dysfunction and the resulting diffusion of ions across the membrane 
this cytoprotective effect provides time for the cell s natural repair mechanisms to restore the cell to normal functioning  of importance during reperfusion  when viable but damaged cells may not survive the oxidative stress resulting from the reintroduction of oxygenated blood 
second  mst improves blood flow  particularly in the microcirculation where the vast majority of oxygen and nutrient exchange occurs  thereby improving tissue perfusion and reperfusion following ischemia 
it impedes the aggregation of red blood cells  or rbcs  by inhibiting the fibrin fibrinogen cross bridges that form between rbcs  causing them to aggregate 
since rbcs traverse microcapillaries in single file  the presence in the circulation of rbc aggregates can significantly impair microvascular blood flow 
inhibiting rbc aggregation also reduces blood viscosity  allowing it to flow more readily  particularly in the low shear environment of the microcirculation 
the anti inflammatory and anti thrombotic pro fibrinolytic properties described below also contribute to improved blood flow 
third  mst inhibits adhesion of circulating blood cells to the endothelium by competing for and physically occupying hydrophobic domains on vessel walls  which has anti inflammatory effects 
endothelial cells line the interior surface of blood vessels  provide a smooth surface for the flow of blood and regulate the movement of water and dissolved materials between the blood and tissues 
the initial step in the inflammatory cascade is adhesion of white blood cells to the endothelium 
by blocking adhesive interactions between white blood cells and the vessel wall  mst helps prevent an inflammatory process from beginning 
fourth  mst helps reduce the pro thrombotic state that may result from disease or injury 
a thrombus  or blood clot  results from aggregation of platelets and clotting factors 
platelet activation  triggered by damage to a vessel wall  causes a cascade of further platelet activation eventually leading to formation of a thrombus 
disease or injury may cause this normal response to turn pathologic  leading to thrombosis  where the thrombus grows to the point of obstructing the flow of blood through the occluded vessel 
studies suggest that mst inhibits weak platelet activation stimuli eg  shear activation of platelets and release of adenosine di phosphate from rbcs  minimizing the self perpetuating response that leads to thrombosis 
however  mst does not inhibit strong platelet activation stimuli eg  platelet receptor interactions directly at the endothelium 
accordingly  we believe mst does not negatively affect normal hemostatic function  which is supported by data from multiple nonclinical studies 
further  mst facilitates fibrinolysis  the body s natural process of dissolving a thrombus 
mst adheres to fibrin monomers during clot formation  making them larger and more readily degraded by plasmin  the endogenous fibrinolytic enzyme that dissolves formed clots 

table of contents clinical application we believe the pharmacodynamic properties of mst cytoprotective  hemorheologic  anti inflammatory  anti thrombotic pro fibrinolytic enable it simultaneously to address  or prevent activation of  multiple biochemical pathways that can result in microcirculatory insufficiency  principally characterized by endothelial dysfunction and impaired blood flow 
the microcirculation is responsible for the delivery of blood through the smallest blood vessels arterioles and capillaries embedded within tissues 
a healthy endothelium is critical to a functional microcirculation 
without the regular delivery of blood and transfer of oxygen to tissue from the microcirculation  individual cells in both the endothelium and tissue are unable to maintain aerobic metabolism and  through a series of complex and interrelated events  eventually die 
if the microcirculatory insufficiency continues  the patient will suffer tissue necrosis  organ damage and  eventually  death 
the potential clinical benefit of mst is greatest in diseases where improving microcirculatory insufficiency is central to improving clinical outcomes 
this includes a wide range of seemingly unrelated diseases and conditions 
poloxamer has shown effectiveness in experimental models of stroke  hemorrhagic shock  acute decompensated heart failure  muscular dystrophy  bypass surgery  deep hypothermic circulatory arrest  spinal cord injury  amniotic fluid embolism  acute ischemic bowel disease and burns 
safety as described above under composition and mechanism of action  mst has little or no affinity for undamaged  hydrophilic domains and  thus  has little or no interaction with healthy cells and tissues 
in addition  the carbon oxygen ether bonds that comprise the poloxamer backbone are not susceptible to biologically relevant metabolic pathways in humans 
following administration  essentially all of the drug is recovered  unchanged  in the urine 
a small amount is recovered in fecal biliary excretion  presumably following uptake by the reticuloendothelial system 
the lack of metabolization and elimination by normal excretion pathways reduces concern over active metabolites driving unintended toxicities 
the safety of poloxamer both purified and non purified has been evaluated in more than clinical studies in multiple indications in which over  subjects have received active drug 
in these studies  poloxamer was generally well tolerated  with the exception of renal toxicities associated with the non purified form of poloxamer  in particular  in a  patient  randomized  controlled study in acute myocardial infarction conducted by burroughs wellcome now  glaxosmithkline  which we refer to as the core study 
in contrast  as discussed below  no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine have been observed in patients treated with purified poloxamer purified poloxamer the therapeutic potential of non purified poloxamer is limited by toxicities associated with low molecular weight substances eg  di block polymers  oligomers  gycols  aldehydes generated during the chemical process by which the poloxamer is synthesized 
we believe these substances were primarily responsible for the acute renal dysfunction observed in prior clinical studies of non purified poloxamer  including the core study  and are a principal reason why clinical development of non purified poloxamer was discontinued by burroughs wellcome 
to address the renal toxicity associated with non purified poloxamer  a proprietary manufacturing and purification process was developed to remove certain low molecular weight substances present in non purified poloxamer in nonclinical studies  compared to the non purified version  purified poloxamer resulted in less accumulation in kidney tissue  lower levels of serum creatinine  less vacuolization of proximal tubular epithelium  and more rapid recovery from vacuolar lesions 
in addition  no difference was observed in the efficacy of purified poloxamer compared to non purified poloxamer data from six clinical studies of purified poloxamer  including a patient  phase study in sickle cell disease  demonstrate that purified poloxamer was generally well tolerated 
transient elevations in liver function tests have been observed  though in each case levels returned to baseline during the follow up period  except in subjects whose liver function tests had been elevated at baseline 
in particular  in contrast to the acute renal dysfunction observed with non purified poloxamer  no clinically significant elevations in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with purified poloxamer we are developing mst using the purified form of poloxamer 
table of contents sickle cell disease overview sickle cell disease is an inherited genetic disorder that affects millions of people worldwide 
it is the most common inherited blood disorder in the us  where it is estimated to affect approximately  to  people 
more than billion is spent annually in the us to treat patients with sickle cell disease 
sickle cell disease is characterized by the sickling of red blood cells  which normally are disc shaped  deformable and move easily through the microvasculature carrying oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body 
sickled  or crescent shaped  red blood cells  on the other hand  are rigid and sticky and tend to adhere to each other and the walls of blood vessels the vascular endothelium 
the hallmark of the disease is recurring episodes of severe pain commonly known as crisis or vaso occlusive crisis 
vaso occlusive crisis occurs when the proportion of sickled cells rises  leading to obstruction of small blood vessels and reduced blood flow to organs and bone marrow 
this obstruction results in intense pain and tissue damage  including necrosis tissue death 
the frequency  severity and duration of these acute crises can vary considerably 
frequency may range from infrequent to more than monthly and duration is typically four to five days  but may last a week or longer 
over a lifetime  the accumulated burden of damaged tissue frequently results in the loss of vital organ function and a greatly reduced lifespan 
in addition to vaso occlusive crises  sickle cell patients can suffer many additional complications  including acute chest syndrome  a respiratory distress syndrome that may arise in the course of an acute crisis  stroke  including silent stroke  which can result from a progressive narrowing of blood vessels  preventing oxygen from reaching the brain  pulmonary hypertension and heart failure  kidney dysfunction and chronic renal failure  bone necrosis of the hip and other major joints  frequent infections due to loss of splenic function and decreased immune function  leg ulcers  blindness  increased rate of complications from pregnancy  and chronic deep muscle and bone pain  even in the absence of acute vaso occlusive pain 
significant unmet need we estimate that  in the us  sickle cell disease results in over  hospitalizations and  in addition  approximately  emergency department treat and release encounters each year 
further  although the number is difficult to measure  we estimate that the number of untreated vaso occlusive crisis events is substantial and in the hundreds of thousands in the us each year 
if mst is approved and as people with sickle cell disease are made aware of the new therapy  we believe that people who would otherwise suffer through a crisis at home may seek treatment 
we are not aware of any currently available therapeutic agents with demonstrated efficacy in shortening the duration or reducing the severity of an ongoing vaso occlusive crisis 
for patients experiencing a vaso occlusive crisis  treatment typically consists of hydration  oxygenation and analgesia for pain  usually using narcotics 
by improving microvascular blood flow and reducing tissue ischemia  mst has the potential to reduce the severity and shorten the duration of vaso occlusive crisis and improve patient outcomes 
clinical development overview mst currently is being evaluated in a phase study in sickle cell disease 
in prior sponsor clinical studies  mst was administered to patients with sickle cell disease over four studies  three of which were for vaso occlusive crisis  including a patient phase study  the fourth study involved patients with acute chest syndrome 
encouraging results in early clinical studies warranted continued development 

table of contents in these studies  mst was generally well tolerated 
based on an integrated analysis of all four studies  the majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate 
the most common adverse events incidence were fever  bilirubinemia direct  pruritus  vomiting  nausea  constipation  headache  tachycardia  pain  weight loss  bilirubinemia  and anemia 
the tolerability of mst did not change significantly with increasing exposure increasing dose and or duration 
the safety profile was similar in children ages and younger compared to adults 
ongoing and planned clinical studies phase study  epic evaluation of purified in children 
in january  we initiated epic  a randomized  double blind  two arm  placebo controlled  phase study of mst in patients with sickle cell disease 
the primary objective is to demonstrate that mst reduces the duration of vaso occlusive crisis  with the duration of crisis measured from the time a patient is randomized to the time at which the patient receives the last dose of parenteral opioid analgesic for the treatment of vaso occlusive crisis prior to hospital discharge 
a total of patients  ages to  who have sickle cell disease and are experiencing acute pain typical of vaso occlusive crisis will be enrolled 
using a two sided alpha of  the study has approximately power to detect a hour difference between treatment arms 
secondary endpoints will compare the rate of re hospitalization for vaso occlusive crisis within days of initial discharge from the hospital and the occurrence of acute chest syndrome within hours of randomization 
the study will enroll subjects from approximately medical centers  primarily in the us although predicting the rate of enrollment is subject to a number of assumptions and the actual enrollment rate may differ materially  we expect to complete enrollment in epic sub study 
it is generally believed that the long term morbidity and mortality associated with sickle cell disease is the consequence of a lifetime of repeated vaso occlusive events and the ensuing ischemia and end organ damage 
we believe decreased microvascular blood flow  or mbf  results in decreased tissue oxygenation and is the physiologic mechanism through which sickle cell disease induces both immediate and long term clinical events 
while the cumulative effect of vaso occlusive episodes may lead to premature end organ failure and death  the incremental effect of an individual episode on organ damage may not present clinically and may not be measureable with current technology 
however  it is possible to measure changes in underlying pathophysiology  such as mbf 
as such  we believe the effect of mst on mbf may be relevant in assessing long term outcomes for sickle cell patients and that mbf  alone or in combination with measures of tissue oxygenation  may be reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in sickle cell disease 
in  we plan to initiate a sub study within epic to evaluate the effect of mst on mbf  as well as tissue oxygen saturation  or sto this sub study will be conducted at select epic sites using non invasive devices to measure mbf and sto and we plan to enroll approximately patients 
tqt study 
in january  we also initiated a thorough qt qtc study  or tqt study  of mst to evaluate the effect of therapeutic and supra therapeutic doses of mst on cardiac ventricular repolarization  specifically the qt interval 
the fda typically requires an assessment of cardiac repolarization for new drugs having systemic bioavailability 
the study is a single center  four period  four way cross over  placebo and positive controlled  double blind  randomized trial 
dosing is ongoing and we expect to announce study results mid year prior sponsor studies in vaso occlusive crisis phase study 
a subject  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled study of mst in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso occlusive crisis was conducted in signs of efficacy were observed in the primary endpoint  duration of crisis  but it did not reach statistical significance 
an hour decrease in the duration of crisis approximately hours in the mst group compared to approximately hours in the placebo group p was observed in the intent to treat population n 
we believe features of the study s design and the study enrolling fewer than the originally planned number of patients  which was patients  may have diluted the treatment effect or its significance 
notably  post hoc analyses identified a statistically significant and greater treatment effect in patients under years of age 
among patients under years of age n  there was a hour decrease in the duration of vaso occlusive crisis in the mst group compared to the placebo group p 
in addition  of the mst group achieved crisis resolution within hours from randomization  a pre specified timepoint set forth in the study protocol  compared to of the placebo group p 

table of contents in terms of safety  no clinically significant differences in the overall incidence of adverse events or adverse events defined as serious were observed between the mst and placebo groups 
notably  there were no clinically significant changes in renal function following treatment with mst compared to placebo 
the mst arm was associated with transient elevations of liver function tests total and direct bilirubin  ast aspartate aminotransferase  and alt alanine aminotransferase  each of which returned to its respective baseline level by the day follow up visit  except in patients whose liver function tests had been elevated at baseline 
adverse events with a greater than increased incidence in the mst group compared to the placebo group and their incidences for mst and placebo patients  respectively  were as follows bilirubinemia direct vs 
 bilirubinemia vs 
 alt increased vs 
 thrombocytopenia vs 
 nausea vs 
 vomiting vs 
 weight loss vs 
 and urticaria vs 

serious adverse events were reported for and of the patients in the mst and placebo groups  respectively 
six patients in the mst group discontinued treatment due to adverse events that included fever  bilirubinemia  tachycardia  pruritus  anemia  embolus  thrombocytopenia  acute chest syndrome  hypoxia  and dyspepsia 
one patient in the mst group died due to cardiopulmonary arrest  which was considered secondary to a fat embolism based on autopsy 
the study investigator believed the underlying cause of death was due to sickle cell disease and not to treatment with mst phase study 
a phase  multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of mst in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso occlusive crisis 
the study enrolled adults ages and older and received study drug but two discontinued prior to completing the full dose due to breakthrough crisis pain and a problem with the iv line administration  respectively 
the most common adverse events incidence were vomiting  nausea  headache  bilirubinemia  fever  anemia  and abdominal pain 
serious adverse events were reported in six patients 
the serious adverse events experienced by five of the six patients were considered unrelated to study drug 
the serious adverse events experienced by the sixth patient were nausea  vomiting  and abdominal pain that were considered possibly related to study drug 
no clinically significant changes in renal function were observed 
repeat exposure study 
an open label  multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the safety of repeat exposure of mst in patients with sickle cell disease experiencing vaso occlusive crisis 
the study enrolled patients  of whom were children ages and younger 
mst was administered as a treatment for up to six episodes of vaso occlusive crisis within a period of one year from enrollment 
seventeen patients received two or more exposures and one patient received six exposures 
the most common adverse events incidence were fever  pruritis  bilirubinemia direct  constipation  nausea  vomiting  tachycardia  abdominal pain  headache  thrombocytopenia  alt increase  urine abnormality  jaundice  and dyspnea 
serious adverse events were reported in five patients 
one study patient died sixteen days after the completion of treatment 
the cause of this patient s death is not known  but the study investigator attributed it to sickle cell disease and considered it to be unrelated to study treatment 
two other subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events 
no clinically significant changes in renal function were observed 
arterial disease introduction as discussed more fully below  data from experimental models demonstrate the potential of mst to improve outcomes in patients experiencing complications of arterial disease 
for these indications  we believe mst may be useful as a stand alone agent or as an adjunct to thrombolytics 
we plan first to demonstrate its potential in acute limb ischemia  a complication of peripheral arterial disease 
ultimately  we plan to leverage the clinical data generated in ali studies to find a partner to develop mst in larger market indications within arterial disease  such as ischemic stroke 
overview arterial disease resulting from atherosclerotic and thromboembolic processes is associated with significant morbidity and mortality 
it is a common circulatory problem in which plaque obstructed arteries reduce the flow of blood to tissues 
atherosclerosis occurs with advanced age  smoking  hypertension  diabetes and dyslipidemia 

table of contents peripheral arterial disease  or pad  refers to disease affecting arteries outside the brain and heart and often refers to blockage of arteries in the lower extremities 
progression of pad is associated with ongoing obstruction  or occlusion  of the peripheral arteries  which can occur slowly over time or may lead to a sudden  acute occlusion 
acute limb ischemia  or ali  is a sudden decrease in perfusion of a limb  typically in the legs  that often threatens viability of the limb 
the condition is considered acute if clinical presentation occurs within approximately two weeks after symptom onset 
critical limb ischemia  or cli  occurs after chronic and severe lack of blood flow to an artery that leads to leg pain while resting  ulcers and gangrene 
in contrast to cli  in which collateral blood vessels may circumvent an occluded artery  ali rapidly threatens limb viability because there is insufficient time for new blood vessel growth to compensate for loss of perfusion 
significant unmet need there are an estimated to million people with pad in the united states 
this prevalence is expected to increase  not only in the us  but throughout the world  as the population ages  cigarette smoking persists  and the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and obesity grows 
acute limb ischemia is an orphan disease within pad with significant unmet needs 
despite urgent revascularization with thrombotic agents or surgery  for patients presenting with ali  the day amputation rate is to and the mortality rate is to 
timely restoration of blood flow is central to the treatment of acute events associated with arterial disease 
current treatment options for ali include revascularization with thrombolytics  endovascular treatment  open surgery  or various combinations of these approaches 
the principal goal is to restore blood flow and tissue perfusion as rapidly as possible rapid restoration of tissue perfusion is critical to regaining clinical function 
current treatments focus on dissolution of the blood clots and improving blood flow in large arteries 
however  these approaches may not improve flow in the microcirculation  where the vast majority of oxygen and nutrient transport occurs 
in addition  while restoration of blood flow is required for limb salvage  the reintroduction of blood flow can initiate reactive hyperemia  leading to reperfusion injury 
existing treatments are not effective at reducing reperfusion injury 
many patients also suffer re thrombosis re stenosis  in which new clots form in a previously treated blood vessel 
a pharmacologic agent that simultaneously can address the limitations of current treatment options is needed to improve clinical outcomes 
we believe the mechanistic activities of mst to shorten time to thrombolysis  reduce re thrombosis and  independent of these  improve blood flow  as well as protect tissues from reperfusion injury  will have utility in treating acute complications of thrombotic arterial disease 
these activities have been demonstrated in experimental and clinical studies  as discussed below 
nonclinical data effect on thrombolysis  blood flow and re thrombosis re stenosis the effectiveness of thrombolytic therapy is limited by the time required to achieve thrombolysis  or dissolution of the occluding clot  the extent of blood flow following thrombolysis and the time to and incidence of re thrombosis 
to assess whether poloxamer improves these outcomes  it was evaluated in an experimental femoral artery thrombolysis model 
tissue plasminogen activator  or tpa  was administered either in combination with saline control or poloxamer the time to restoration of flow  or reperfusion  and the extent of flow following reperfusion were measured using a calibrated electromagnetic flow probe 
treatment with poloxamer resulted in a shorter time to reperfusion  compared to tpa plus saline minutes v 
minutes  respectively p 
blood flow following reperfusion was also significantly increased by over tpa plus saline p and the time to re occlusion was also significantly prolonged min vs 
min p 
effect on reperfusion injury reperfusion injury is the paradoxical damage to tissues caused by the restoration of blood flow following a period of ischemia 
it is believed to result from activation of inflammatory and oxidative processes upon ischemia injured cells 
to determine its effect on reperfusion injury  poloxamer was evaluated relative to sham and saline controls in a reperfusion model following one hour of ischemia 
treatment effects were evaluated based on histopathology  myeloperoxidase and heme oxygenase activity and edema score  and gene expression arrays covering the spectrum of genes associated with ischemia reperfusion injury 
study treatments were administered during reperfusion 

table of contents compared to sham  histopathology following saline control showed marked damage to tissue cyto architecture  as well as hemorrhage  edema  ulceration and inflammatory cell infiltration 
in contrast  histopathology following treatment with poloxamer appeared nearly identical to sham  with little damage to tissue architecture and none of the changes observed with saline control 
quantification of these observations using the chui score showed the differences were statistically significant vs 
for saline and poloxamer  respectively p 
consistent with histopathology  myeloperoxidase and heme oxygenase activity and edema all were significantly elevated following reperfusion injury 
these markers were significantly reduced following treatment with poloxamer  but not saline control 
gene expression arrays further validated the histopathological observations 
compared to sham  expression of important injury pathways including acute phase reactants  adhesion receptors  coagulation enzymes  chemokines  matrix metaloproteinases  apoptosis and vegf signaling remained altered in saline controls 
however  in almost every case  gene expression returned toward sham levels following treatment with poloxamer in those instances where gene expression was altered by ischemia reperfusion injury 
effect on re thrombosis re stenosis poloxamer was evaluated for its effect on acute thrombosis in a model of experimental angioplasty and stent placement 
specifically  this model measured the extent of artery occlusion following placement of a coiled wire stent under excessive angioplasty pressure 
control treatment saline plus heparin resulted in average occlusion of about 
test treatment poloxamer plus heparin resulted in significantly less occlusion mean of about p 
electron micrographs of the occlusive thrombi revealed that platelets adhered to areas damaged by the angioplasty with both control and test treatments 
however  platelets degranulated and accumulated to form large thrombi with control treatment while  with test treatment  platelets did not de granulate or accumulate and a smaller layer of adherent platelets was observed 
these observations suggest that poloxamer cannot overcome the highly specific platelet vessel wall interactions needed to stop bleeding associated with injury 
however  it is able to inhibit the extension of a platelet thrombus  when the stimulus for the growing thrombus is the thrombus itself 
effect on blood flow in experimental ischemic stroke the effect of poloxamer on cerebral artery blood flow was measured over four hours following experimentally induced complete occlusion 
blood flow was measured using a well established hydrogen wash out technique 
poloxamer  but not placebo  increased blood flow by an average of in areas or severe or moderate ischemia  but had little effect in areas with mild or no ischemia 
these observations suggest poloxamer improves flow in ischemic tissues without stealing flow from non ischemic tissues 
the overall difference in blood flow between poloxamer and placebo at four hours following occlusion was statistically significant p 
clinical data clinical trials directly evaluating the effect of mst on clinical outcomes in ali have not been conducted 
however  its synergy with thrombolytics and its pharmacological effects on arterial and microvascular blood flow and reperfusion injury have been observed in studies of poloxamer in patients with acute myocardial infarction and sickle cell crisis 
we believe these previously observed effects have potential to translate into clinically meaningful benefits in ali and other conditions where thrombolytics are indicated or useful 
the effect of poloxamer on early coronary patency and reperfusion injury was evaluated in a randomized  multicenter  placebo controlled phase study in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction  which we refer to as the pre core study 
one hundred fourteen patients with symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction were randomized immediately after the initiation of thrombolytic therapy to receive poloxamer test or placebo control 
myocardial infarct size was assessed through spect imaging 
global lv ejection fraction was assessed through radionuclide angiography performed to days after randomization 
median infarct size was significantly smaller in the test group than in the control group p 
median lv ejection fraction was significantly higher in the test group than in the control group p 
in addition  the incidence of in hospital reinfarction was significantly lower in the test group than in the control group p 
the study investigators concluded that poloxamer may enhance early coronary patency time to reperfusion by accelerating thrombolysis and may reduce reperfusion injury as evidenced by reduced myocardial infarct size and improved lv function 

table of contents the effect of poloxamer on coronary artery patency also was evaluated in a randomized sub study conducted as part of the core study  an approximately  patient phase study in acute myocardial infarction 
in the sub study  seventy one patients with symptoms consistent with acute myocardial infarction were randomized shortly after initiating thrombolytic therapy to receive poloxamer test or placebo control 
patency was assessed in the infarct related artery with angiograms completed to minutes after randomization 
all angiograms were analyzed in a central laboratory without knowledge of treatment assignment or clinical outcome and assigned a thrombolysis in myocardial infarction  or timi  grade flow score 
timi grade flow is a scoring system from referring to levels of coronary blood flow assessed during percutaneous coronary angioplasty 
the rates of timi grade or partial or complete perfusion were in the test group and in the control group p 
these data suggest that treatment with poloxamer results in greater proportion of patients achieving clinically significant reperfusion timi grades or compared to control 
for the overall core study  outcomes were equivocal in the primary endpoint a composite outcome of death  reinfarction and cardiogenic shock at days post randomization 
however  the comparable dosing regimens that were evaluated and found effective in the pre core study described in the preceding paragraph were discontinued within months of initiation of the core study as a result of the acute renal dysfunction described above under purified poloxamer we believe discontinuation of the two high dose regimens and the low dose longer duration regimen in the core study  and that of patients who received active drug in the core study received a low dose shorter duration regimen  negatively impacted the overall study results 
the effect of mst on microvascular blood flow was evaluated in a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled sub study conducted as part of a phase study in sickle cell disease 
nine patients with sickle cell disease who were hospitalized for vaso occlusive crisis were studied to objectively  longitudinally and quantitatively investigate the in vivo effects of mst on real time microcirculation in the bulbar conjunctiva during vaso occlusive crisis 
subjects were randomly assigned to receive mst test or placebo control 
following treatment  compared to control  all four patients treated with mst showed significant improvement in red blood cell velocity at both approximately two hours p and at seven hours p after initiation of treatment 
for the mst subjects  the velocity values observed at seven hours after initiation of treatment were similar to historical steady state non crisis values for sickle cell patients 
planned development acute limb ischemia we are planning a phase  clinical proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mst in ali 
we plan to solicit fda input on the study in the third quarter of and  depending in part upon fda input  we expect to initiate the study in late or early we anticipate that the study will enroll approximately patients and compare one or more doses of mst in combination with a thrombolytic against the thrombolytic alone 
efficacy will be assessed primarily on measures of improved arterial patency and tissue perfusion 
we expect the study will take approximately to months to enroll 
acute ischemic cerebrovascular infarction stroke although we currently are focused on ali  there may be substantial growth opportunities for mst within arterial disease 
we believe that  based on the similar pathophysiology of atherosclerotic arterial disease plaque obstructed arteries reducing the flow of blood to tissue  an agent that is effective in one form of occlusive arterial disease also may be effective in its other manifestations 
our strategy in arterial disease is first to demonstrate the utility of mst in patients with ali  an advanced form of arterial disease  where we believe the potential to demonstrate a treatment effect is greatest 
by generating clinical proof of concept data in ali  we believe we increase development and partnering opportunities in other forms of occlusive arterial disease 
we plan to leverage the data generated in the planned phase study in ali to find a partner to develop mst in larger market indications within arterial disease  such as ischemic stroke 

table of contents treatment options for stroke are similar to those for ali  except that surgical intervention is less viable in stroke due to proximity of the occluded artery to the brain  making intravenous and intraarterial thrombolytic therapy the dominant treatment modalities 
timely intervention is particularly critical as brain damage during acute ischemic stroke is a rapid  progressive process 
in a typical large vessel acute ischemic stroke  million neurons may be lost each minute without management 
in addition  brain cells in the ischemic penumbra that remain metabolically active may be salvageable with timely assessment and management 
as described above  compared to tpa alone  poloxamer accelerated time to reperfusion by approximately when used in combination with tpa  the only fda approved thrombolytic treatment for acute ischemic stroke 
however  tpa has not demonstrated improved outcomes if administered more than three hours after onset of stroke symptoms 
if the results observed in experimental models are demonstrated in clinical studies  mst may improve the effectiveness of tpa  including by lengthening the window in which tpa is effective in patients presenting with ischemic stroke 
resuscitation of shock following major trauma introduction as discussed more fully below  mst has improved survival in numerous nonclinical studies in hemorrhagic shock  and we believe it has potential to improve outcomes for patients who experience shock following major trauma 
however  based on our current focus on the phase study in sickle cell disease and development for complications of arterial disease  it is unlikely we would initiate a clinical study in this indication without funding from the us government or some other third party collaborator 
overview trauma care is a major part of the us medical economic system 
based on data  trauma related disorders rank among the top five most costly medical conditions in the us  with estimated health care expenditures totaling more than billion  and we estimate that the incidence of severe hemorrhage resulting from trauma is greater than  per year 
major trauma typically involves multiple injuries  blood loss  shock  need for emergency surgical intervention and resuscitation 
shock following massive bleeding  or hemorrhagic shock  is a physiologic response based on an imbalance between systemic oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption 
initially  as circulating blood volume falls due to hemorrhage  the body activates a variety of physiologic responses to maintain blood pressure and the flow of oxygen rich blood to tissues 
however  if circulating volume is not restored  these compensatory mechanisms begin to fail 
as cells become increasingly hypoxic and their metabolic energy requirements are not met  cell membrane integrity is compromised  ions diffuse between the intracellular and extracellular environments  fluid leaks into the interstitial space and inflammatory and clotting cascades are triggered 
even following resolution of the underlying hemorrhage and restoration of circulating volume  periods of ischemia can result in tissue and organ damage and death 
the primary treatment goal in major trauma is to stop the bleeding  typically through surgery  followed by restoration of circulating blood volume and pressure  referred to as resuscitation 
resuscitation is achieved through intravenous administration of blood products eg  packed red blood cells  plasma and non blood fluids eg  colloids  crystalloids  as well as with the use of vasopressors to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure 
significant unmet need since world war i  the epidemiology of death from trauma has changed 
rates of early hospital death from blood loss have been reduced with the introduction of damage control surgery 
the advent of regional trauma systems that enable rapid triage and intervention has improved mortality rates 
however  while victims of major trauma often will survive  complications are frequent and recovery prolonged 
treatment costs are high and increase rapidly with severity 
the estimated per patient cost to treat trauma induced shock is  rising to  in cases of severe shock and  if multiple organ failure presents 

table of contents multiple organ failure  or mof  remains a major cause of prolonged stay in the intensive care unit  or icu 
increased understanding of the pathogenesis of mof suggests that shock initiates a dysfunctional inflammatory process that causes or contributes to mof 
while resuscitation is necessary for patient survival  most resuscitation fluids are not directed at modulating inflammation and  in fact  may worsen it 
reperfusion injury  where tissue and organ damage occur due to the introduction of blood and other resuscitation fluids eg  as a result of oxidative damage and inflammation  remains a significant concern 
despite significant morbidity and expense  for over years  there have been no major advances in therapeutics approved for resuscitation following severe hemorrhage 
based on its hemorheologic  cytoprotective and anti inflammatory properties  mst may have utility as an adjunct therapy for resuscitation following major trauma 
nonclinical data the potential clinical benefits of mst are suggested by the results of numerous experimental models of hemorrhagic shock 
for example  an article in shock october summarized the results of mst in multiple models of hemorrhagic shock 
in these studies  which we refer to as the hunter studies  relative to control  mst decreased fluid requirements required to regain and maintain hemodynamic performance goals p  reduced tissue permeability fluid extravasation in the lung and small intestine p  reduced myeloperoxidase  a marker of inflammation p  and caspases   and  mediators of apoptosis p  and improved survival p 
the study investigators concluded that mst has a significant cytoprotective effect in preventing endothelial and other cell damage during hypotension and reperfusion and inhibited both necrosis and apoptosis induced by trauma 
a study published in resuscitation june and funded by the defense advanced research projects agency darpa surviving blood loss sbl program  which we refer to as the darpa study  evaluated mst in a severe hemorrhage model developed specifically for evaluating low volume resuscitation products as part of the darpa sbl program 
mst significantly improved median survival time after severe controlled hemorrhage  compared to control p 
the darpa study also evaluated thrombelastography  or teg  a measure of the efficiency of blood coagulation 
results from the darpa study suggested that mst caused teg abnormalities consistent with an anti coagulant effect 
thus  while the survival results were positive and consistent with prior studies  the study investigators were uncertain as to the utility of mst in uncontrolled hemorrhage due to its negative effect on coagulation  as measured by teg  and recommended additional experiments to determine the physiological significance of the teg results 
notably  the hunter studies also evaluated mst in an experimental model of uncontrolled hemorrhage  and reached a contrary conclusion to that in the darpa study with regard to the effect of mst on bleeding risk 
in the uncontrolled hemorrhage model conducted as part of the hunter studies  mean blood loss was similar in the mst and control groups  as was distribution around the mean 
in fact  the mst group had slightly less bleeding 
these findings were consistent with prior studies demonstrating that mst did not adversely affect blood coagulation  platelet aggregation or bleeding time 
however  teg data were not collected in the hunter studies 
planned development and other activities nonclinical activities we plan to evaluate the physiologic significance of the teg results observed in the darpa study through series of nonclinical studies  which we refer to as the teg studies 
we believe that mst s hydrophobic interactions decrease the number of rbcs in a forming clot  which would affect teg 
however  while mst affects teg  we believe it does not negatively affect clot integrity or hemostatic function because the tensile strength of a clot is largely dependent on fibrin polymerization and not the presence of rbcs within the clot structure 
this position is supported by a direct  in vivo evaluation of bleeding in a model of uncontrolled hemorrhage  as reported in the shock article  as well as substantial in vitro and ex vivo data from numerous nonclinical and clinical studies demonstrating that mst does not adversely affect blood coagulation  platelet aggregation or bleeding time 
we expect to announce the results of the teg studies in the second half of 
table of contents phase clinical study if the results of the teg studies support that mst does not increase bleeding risk  and subject to the third party funding described below  we plan to conduct a dose finding  phase  clinical proof of concept study 
over the past several months  in collaboration with a leading university in the research and care of trauma patients  we have developed the protocol for a randomized  placebo controlled  dose escalation study in patients admitted to the icu for shock resuscitation following major torso trauma 
the study would evaluate the safety of mst  as well as its efficacy based on clinical and nonclinical parameters  including endothelial activation  immune system response  tissue perfusion  fluid and other intervention requirements  time to resuscitation  complication rates  icu free days  hospital free days and day survival 
we would expect to enroll approximately patients and that enrollment would take approximately to months 
the study would be conducted at a single site in the us a key component of the study is adherence to a resuscitation protocol that incorporates goal directed treatment and standardizes patient care across the study  an important variable that may not have been controlled adequately in prior studies of other investigational drugs in hemorrhagic shock 
us government or other third party funding the us government previously funded the darpa study through the sbl program 
if we demonstrate that the teg results observed in the darpa study do not have physiologic significance  we believe the government will have renewed interest in developing mst as a therapy in major trauma 
we have identified relevant rfps requests for proposals issued by us government agencies and are preparing applications to request funding 
however  absent interest from the us government or another third party  it is unlikely we would initiate the phase study described above 
limitations of prior studies in hemorrhagic shock numerous drugs for hemorrhagic shock have been evaluated in large  multi center clinical studies  without success 
however  we believe these drugs and or studies had limitations that made it difficult to demonstrate a treatment effect 
we believe mst and our protocol for the phase  clinical proof of concept study address these factors 
intervention in prior studies typically was in the pre hospital setting  before hemorrhage had been addressed through surgery and the patient stabilized 
the heterogeneity of trauma patients and variability in outcomes prior to admission to the icu is substantial 
the post perioperative setting is a more controlled environment in which to evaluate drug effect 
patients participating in our phase study would be randomized upon admission to the icu  where patient homogeneity is greater and outcomes are more certain 
certain drugs evaluated in hemorrhagic shock were product line extensions not originally developed for their utility in trauma 
for instance  activated recombinant human factor vii rfviia  novoseven is approved for use in hemophilia with inhibitors 
it was hypothesized that its pro coagulant properties might limit bleeding and improve outcomes in trauma 
its sponsor  novo nordisk  initiated a  patient study to evaluate whether novoseven improved all cause day survival in patients with active hemorrhage caused by blunt and or penetrating trauma who had already received between four and eight units of red blood cells 
while novoseven reduced blood product use  the study was terminated prematurely for futility after evaluating data from blunt trauma patients probability of success 
it is notable that the study was conducted in patients with active hemorrhage  despite standard hemostatic intervention  likely increasing heterogeneity of the subject population  as described above 
more notable  however  is that novoseven targets only bleeding risk and does not address microcirculatory damage resulting from ischemia or the potential for injury during reperfusion 
patients in this study likely had experienced periods of ischemia and were at risk for reperfusion injury  for which a single pathway agent is unlikely to improve clinical outcomes 
mst s broad activity may resolve multiple pathologies in patients undergoing resuscitation following major trauma 

table of contents a potentially significant limitation of prior studies  international studies in particular  may have been the failure to rigorously control resuscitation protocols across subjects 
studies have shown that the choice of resuscitation fluid and the timing and rate of intervention may impact outcome 
not all resuscitation fluids have the same physiologic effect and different compositions may affect clinical outcomes 
saline albumin fluid evaluation  translation of research into practice study safe trips  an international collaboration that assessed worldwide fluid resuscitation practices in the icu  concluded that the choice of resuscitation fluid depended primarily on geographic location 
inconsistent resuscitation practices alone might undermine an effective drug in an otherwise well designed study 
our planned phase  clinical proof of concept study incorporates an icu protocol that minimizes variability and increases uniformity of care for all clinical trial subjects 
evolving standards of care for trauma victims may have hindered prior development of drugs in hemorrhagic shock 
previously  advanced trauma support called for resuscitation with large volumes of fluid  even before hemorrhage control 
however  it is now believed that such approach may lead to increased bleeding and mortality 
hypotensive resuscitation  where blood pressure of mmhg is targeted  is becoming standard of care and may better maintain perfusion of vital organs without causing further bleeding 
not controlling for this unidentified  underlying variability would reduce statistical power and potentially mask the treatment benefit of an effective drug 
finally  several companies with large studies in hemorrhagic shock were developing blood substitutes known as hemoglobin based oxygen carriers  or hbocs 
hboc development largely has been discontinued due to associations with significant cardiovascular dysfunction eg  hypertension  low cardiac output 
a meta analysis of several different hbocs found that  as a class  patients treated with hbocs had a increased risk of mortality and a fold increased risk for myocardial infarction 
multiple hboc studies were terminated prematurely due to increased mortality in the hboc arm 
manufacturing we do not have  and have not made plans to establish  our own manufacturing facilities 
we meet our requirements for nonclinical and clinical trial material including manufacturing active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  formulating and assembling final drug product  labeling  testing and release  packaging  storing api and finished drug product and similar activities by establishing relationships with third party manufacturers and other service providers to perform these services for us 
for mst clinical trial material  we have entered into supply agreements with pierre fabre m dicament pfm and patheon inc for api and finished drug product  respectively 
there are a limited number of manufacturers with the technical capabilities and desire to perform the specialized  proprietary processes required to produce mst we have not made plans to engage alternative suppliers for clinical trial material 
therefore  if pfm or patheon become unable or unwilling to perform  we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material 
our current agreements with pfm and patheon may not cover all of our clinical trial material needs and we may meet future clinical trial material needs through individual proposals or statements of work  which inherently involves uncertainty as to ongoing supply and may result in delays in the completion of ongoing clinical studies and initiation of new studies 
as development of mst progresses  we plan to pursue agreements for commercial production of mst in the event negotiations are protracted or unsuccessful  commercialization of mst  if it receives regulatory approval  may be delayed 
in addition  although commercially available  there are a limited number of sources of poloxamer  the api starting material for mst we do not have a direct relationship with basf  the current supplier of the api starting material and  although basf has extensive  worldwide operations and poloxamer is part of its standard product portfolio  we do not have any control over its production and basf may change its manufacturing process and or limit the availability of its poloxamer product in the future 
we are evaluating development of our own proprietary process for manufacturing api starting material in accordance with current good manufacturing practices applicable to api  which could enhance our control over the availability and quality of api starting material  as well as our intellectual property position with regard to mst in the future  establishing supply agreements  particularly with respect to commercial manufacturing  may require us to agree to minimum volume requirements  exclusivity arrangements  substantial investment in infrastructure and or other restrictive terms 
as discussed above  our alternatives may be limited due to the specialized nature of the technologies and methods used to manufacture mst in addition  if we seek to make certain changes to the manufacturing process  including changing our sources of api starting material  api  or finished drug product  we will need fda review and approval before the change can be implemented 
among other things  the fda may require clinical  stability or other data for mst manufactured with new materials or by new manufacturers  which data will take time and is costly to generate  and the delay associated with generating this data would increase our costs and may delay completion of development of mst and or its commercialization 

table of contents intellectual property our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing equivalent versions of our product candidates 
to protect our proprietary compounds  we have implemented and will continue to pursue a multi faceted approach that relies on a combination of patent protection  proprietary know how  trade secrets and marketing exclusivity 
we seek to establish and protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality  licensing and other agreements  including those with our contract manufacturers  such as pfm 
for particular indications  such as rare or orphan diseases  our products may benefit from periods of post approval marketing exclusivity 
for example  the fda has granted orphan drug designation for poloxamer purified for the treatment of sickle cell disease  which includes the treatment and prevention of the complications of sickle cell disease 
in addition  the european commission has designated poloxamer as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease 
we plan to seek orphan drug designation for ali 
as described below under government regulation orphan drug designation  if mst is the first drug product in which poloxamer is the active ingredient to receive fda approval for reducing the duration of vaso occlusive crisis in patients with sickle cell disease  the fda may not approve any other application to market a drug product in which poloxamer is the active ingredient for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as another drug product showing clinical superiority to mst with regard to the european union  mst may benefit from ten years of market exclusivity 
orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process 
in addition  competitors may receive approval of different drugs or biologics for the same indication for which mst is approved 
since we acquired mst in  we have filed for patent protection covering our proprietary supercritical fluid extraction process  methods of using poloxamers in various clinical settings  and the use of poloxamers in combination therapy 
we continue to evaluate new patent concepts and plan to file additional patent applications 
in particular  we are developing a patent position around the use and optimal dosing of mst based on unpublished data from prior clinical studies  which we expect to augment with data from our on going phase study of mst in sickle cell disease 
in addition  pursuant to an agreement with cytrx corporation described below under license agreement with cytrx corporation  we have exclusive rights to a variety of issued patents related to poloxamers and their uses 
however  we expect that many of these patents will expire prior to obtaining regulatory approval for mst in addition to patent protection related to our poloxamer purification process  we continue to expand our proprietary manufacturing know how 
for macromolecules  such as mst  acceptance criteria for starting materials and in process and release specifications are critical to the quality of drug product 
without these proprietary specifications  we believe competitors will be unable to manufacture products that are equivalent to mst in the manner that regulatory agencies will require 
further  we are evaluating the use of proprietary analytical standards and bioanalytical assays to further augment our control over product quality  as well as evaluating development of our own proprietary process for manufacturing api starting material  which we expect would further enhance our proprietary position around mst we are aware of a substantial number of patents issued and patent applications filed in our technical areas or fields 
there is a risk that third parties may allege that they have patent rights encompassing our product candidates or methods and no assurance can be given that patents do not exist  have not been filed  or could not be filed or issued  that contain claims covering our product candidates or methods 
we cannot provide assurance that our pending patent applications will issue as patents  that any issued patents will provide us with significant competitive advantages  or that the validity or enforceability of any of our patents will not be challenged or  if instituted  that these challenges will not be successful 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of our patents could be substantial 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or methods  duplicate our technologies or methods  or design around the patented aspects of our products  technologies or methods 
we can provide no assurance that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others  licenses to which might not be available to us 

table of contents in addition  the approval process for patent applications in different countries may differ significantly 
the patent authorities in each country administer that country s laws and regulations relating to patents independently of the laws and regulations of any other country and the patents must be sought and obtained separately  which can add substantial cost and expense 
in addition  a favorable outcome or approval in one country does not necessarily indicate that a favorable outcome or approval will be obtained in other countries 
competition the industries in which we operate biopharmaceutical  specialty pharmaceutical  biotechnology and pharmaceutical are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change 
if any of our product candidates are approved by regulatory authorities  we expect they will face significant competition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products  particularly large pharmaceutical companies 
many of our potential competitors have greater clinical  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing  distribution  compliance and financial resources and experience than do we 
over the longer term  our ability  independently or otherwise  to successfully manufacture  market  distribute and sell any approved products  expand their usage or bring additional new products to the marketplace will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  fda and foreign regulatory agencies approvals of new products and indications  the efficacy and safety of our products alone and relative to other treatment options  the degree of patent or other protection afforded to particular products  and reimbursement for use of those products 
we have focused our resources on development of mst  which has potential application in a wide range of serious or life threatening diseases and conditions characterized by microcirculatory insufficiency 
many other organizations are developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat such diseases and conditions and developments by others may render potential application of mst in a particular indication obsolete or noncompetitive  even prior to completion of its development for that indication 
further  there is increasing interest in developing drugs for rare diseases  which may have the effect of increasing the development of agents to treat sickle cell disease  ali  and other indications we may pursue 
legislative action may generate further interest 
for instance  in july  the food and drug administration safety and innovation act was signed into law 
this act amended the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act in a variety of ways that encourage or facilitate the development of drugs for patients with rare diseases  including by expanding the priority review voucher system to rare pediatric diseases and encouraging the fda to implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of new medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life threatening diseases or conditions using a broad range of surrogate endpoints 
sickle cell disease currently  there are few options for patients suffering complications of sickle cell disease 
patients experiencing vaso occlusive crisis typically are treated with hydration  oxygenation and analgesia for pain  usually consisting of narcotics  such as morphine 
hydroxyurea  a form of chemotherapy used for myeloproliferative disease  is an approved product that has been shown to decrease the frequency of vaso occlusive crisis  but it is not approved to intervene after onset of a vaso occlusive crisis  it has not been shown to treat the crisis itself 
we are not aware of any therapeutic agents that have been approved to reduce the duration or severity of an on going vaso occlusive crisis 
however  there is substantial interest in developing agents to treat or cure sickle cell disease and sickle cell disease related complications 
we are aware of numerous companies with product candidates in varying stages of development for the treatment of vaso occlusive crisis  including mechanisms that target the py adp receptor  increase oxygen binding of hemoglobin or stimulate production of fetal hemoglobin 
some of these companies are large  well financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or have partnered with such companies  which may give them development  regulatory and or marketing advantages over us 
for example  pfizer and novartis have each invested in privately held companies  glycomimetics  inc and selexys pharmaceuticals corporation  respectively  with clinical stage agents for the treatment of vaso occlusive crisis 
those deals have reported potential values of million and million to glycomimetics and selexys  respectively 
in addition  numerous non profit or non commercial foundations and interest groups also are committed to improving outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease 
advances in the understanding of the signaling pathways associated with sickle cell disease may lead to further interest and development of treatment options 

table of contents more broadly  mst would compete against agents designed to treat the underlying pathology of sickle cell disease  of which vaso occlusive crisis is a complication 
bone marrow and stem cell transplantation have been shown to be effective to treat and  in some cases  cure sickle cell disease  but current methods are not available to the majority of patients due to the risk of serious complications  including graft versus host disease and infection  the high cost of the procedures  and the unavailability of a well matched donor 
forms of gene therapy are being pursued to correct sickle cell disease by halting production of sickled cells  but they are in preclinical or early stage clinical development 
arterial disease current treatment options for arterial disease depend on disease severity and patient specific factors 
some forms of thrombotic arterial disease may be addressed through lifestyle changes eg  smoking cessation  regular physical activity  heart healthy diet and medication to control high cholesterol  high blood pressure and blood glucose 
to the extent patients are able to control symptoms and prevent disease progression with lifestyle changes and medical therapy  the potential market for mst in arterial disease will be reduced 
severe expressions of pad  such ali  typically require revascularization to restore blood flow  whether through administration of thrombolytics  endovascular procedures  open surgery  or various combinations of these approaches 
we believe mst  if approved  would be compatible with the standard of care and we intend first to develop it as an adjunct to thrombolytics  but some medical professionals could perceive mst as competitive with their current treatment methods and or be adverse to a new approach 
we are aware of a number of investigational therapies for severe forms of thrombotic arterial disease  such as angiogenic growth factors  vasoactive drugs  anticoagulants  thrombolytics  anti platelet agents  cytoprotectives  and blood substitutes 
if approved  mst could compete with these therapies  certain of which are in late stage clinical development 
should any of these other investigational therapies receive regulatory approval prior to mst  they may become entrenched in the standard of care  diminish the need for mst  or be difficult to displace 
resuscitation of shock following major trauma we are aware of various organizations that are developing therapies for hemorrhagic shock  including agents to improve blood flow in the microvasculature  improve oxygenation of ischemic tissues  and or prevent reperfusion injury 
some of these organizations have received funding from the federal government to progress their research and development in this area 
efforts to improve patient outcomes after surgery for severe hemorrhage include new types and methods of fluid resuscitation eg  anti platelet  hormonal  and hypertonic agents  pressors  and blood factors  additives or substitutes 
to the extent other therapies demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy and receive regulatory approval prior to mst  the need for mst may be diminished 
in addition to investigational pharmacologic approaches  new resuscitation protocols are being explored to reduce morbidity and mortality following major hemorrhage and  to the extent they are successful  they may diminish the need for mst  should it be approved 
acquisition of synthrx  inc during and the first half of  our business strategy involved a particular focus on expanding our product pipeline 
we retained an investment banking firm to advise us in this regard and our board of directors formed a special committee to assist it in evaluating potential opportunities 
our management and the special committee  with assistance from the investment bank and other consultants  evaluated numerous opportunities with companies with a wide range of development programs 
during this process  we identified synthrx  inc as a company whose lead product candidate  which we are now developing as mst  was a strong fit with our pipeline expansion strategy 
synthrx was a private company formed in to acquire purified poloxamer from cytrx corporation  but after acquiring rights to purified poloxamer  synthrx did not have the financial resources to pursue its development 
the co founders of synthrx had been involved with the development of poloxamer and purified poloxamer as employees of cytrx 

table of contents in april  we completed the acquisition of synthrx  inc pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger  and synthrx became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
the payment terms of the merger agreement were structured such that the majority of the merger consideration would be payable only in the event of achievement of the milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
all of the merger consideration was intended to be paid in shares of our common stock and  in june at our annual meeting of stockholders  our stockholders approved the issuance of shares of our common stock  in lieu of any cash payments  in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement 
as of march   there are outstanding an aggregate of  shares of our common stock that we issued to the former synthrx stockholders 
an aggregate of  shares were issued upon the closing of the merger  but we repurchased  of those shares in december for per share pursuant to the exercise of a repurchase right triggered as a result of the timing of and planned number of subjects in the epic study 
we could issue up to an aggregate of  additional shares of our common stock to the former synthrx stockholders if and when the development of mst achieves certain milestones 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we also agreed  among other things  a to use commercially reasonable efforts until the earlier of achievement of the third milestone  which is approval of an nda covering the use of purified poloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children  or the date that is four years after february  to develop an intravenous injection product in which purified poloxamer is an active ingredient  and b until the earlier of the achievement of the third milestone and the date that is four years following february   not to consummate a change of control with a third party that involves all or substantially all of synthrx s assets  except i in connection with an exempt transaction as described below or ii with the written consent of synthrx  which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld  conditioned or delayed 
under the merger agreement  an exempt transaction is a change of control that closes prior to achievement of the third milestone in which the acquiror agrees in writing to submit an nda covering the use of purified poloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children  or the nda  for fda approval or  if there are unexpected safety or regulatory issues  to conduct activities to address or resolve such issues until the earlier of x the date that  beginning on april  and thereafter  the aggregate expenditure related to the program involving the product candidate on which the nda is to be based is at least million and y the fourth anniversary of april   provided  however  such acquiror shall be relieved of such obligations under certain specified conditions 
license agreement with cytrx corporation through a prior license agreement between synthrx and cytrx corporation  we have rights to issued patents related to poloxamers and their uses 
the issued patents cover  among other things  poloxamer  purified poloxamer  methods of treating sickle cell anemia using poloxamer and methods of preparing purified poloxamer under this license agreement  as amended  synthrx has an exclusive license  with the right to grant sublicenses  under specified patents to use  offer and sell covered products in all of the countries in the world and in all fields  except those fields that  at the time of the agreement  were or will be licensed pursuant to certain identified agreements 
we believe that the field limitation does not prevent us from developing or commercializing mst for the treatment of complications of sickle cell disease 
in partial consideration of the license grant  synthrx agreed to pay cytrx certain non refundable and non creditable milestone payments based on the approval of each covered product in a major market  which includes the us the amount of each milestone is in the low single digit millions  half of which is due on the first commercial sale of the approved product and half of which is payable over time based on a percentage of quarterly net sales 
in addition  synthrx would pay a single digit royalty on net sales of covered products 
however  in the event of a sublicense under the specified patents  in lieu of the foregoing milestone and royalty payments  synthrx  in its sole discretion  may elect to pay cytrx an amount equal to of any sublicensing income received by synthrx within days of receipt thereof 
sublicense income includes  without limitation  license fees  royalties  milestone payments  license maintenance fees and strategic alliance payments  whether in cash  equity or other property  with the payment to be in the same form as the payment received by synthrx 
other product candidates in prior years  we were focused on the development of anx docetaxel for injectable emulsion and exelbine vinorelbine injectable emulsion  which are novel emulsion formulations of currently marketed chemotherapy drugs 
as a result of our current focus on mst  we elected to discontinue independent development of anx and exelbine in and  respectively  and are evaluating other opportunities for further development of these programs  such as partnering and licensing arrangements 

table of contents anx is a novel  detergent free formulation of docetaxel  an intravenously injected chemotherapy drug commonly used to treat solid tumors 
taxotere  a branded formulation of docetaxel  is approved to treat breast  non small cell lung  prostate  gastric  and head and neck cancers 
anx was designed to have efficacy comparable to taxotere without the non active  toxic components found in taxotere and without the corticosteroid premedication regimen required with taxotere 
in october  we reached agreement with the fda on a pivotal study for anx that would support approval of anx without a corticosteroid premedication regimen 
we agreed on a patient  non inferiority study with a primary objective of comparing fluid retention following treatment with anx  administered without corticosteroid premedication  and taxotere  administered with corticosteroid premedication 
however  in  in accordance with our strategy to focus on mst  we determined not initiate any clinical studies of anx in the foreseeable future 
exelbine is a novel emulsion formulation of the chemotherapy drug vinorelbine 
navelbine  a branded formulation of vinorelbine  is approved in the us to treat advanced non small cell lung cancer as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin  and approved in the european union to treat non small cell lung cancer and advanced or metastatic breast cancer 
in august  we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding the new drug application we submitted in november seeking approval of exelbine for the same indications as navelbine 
the fda stated that it could not approve the exelbine nda in its present form and that the bioequivalence study we had sponsored would need to be repeated because the authenticity of the drug products used in the bioequivalence trial could not be verified in accordance with fda standards 
notably  at a meeting with the fda following our receipt of the complete response letter  fda staff commented that no clinical deficiencies were noted with the bioequivalence study and that there were no comments regarding our conclusion that exelbine and navelbine are bioequivalent 
however  we elected to discontinue independent development of exelbine and are seeking a partner or outside investor for the program to complete the necessary bioequivalence study 
government regulation governmental authorities in the us and other countries extensively regulate the testing  manufacturing  labeling and packaging  storage  recordkeeping  advertising  promotion  marketing and distribution  among other things  of pharmaceutical products 
in the us  the fda  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdca  and other federal statutes and regulations  subjects pharmaceutical products to rigorous review 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  we may be fined  the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products  and we may be criminally prosecuted 
we and our third party manufacturers  distributors and cros may also be subject to regulations under other federal  state  and local laws  including the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the clean air act  the health insurance portability and accountability act  privacy laws and import  export and customs regulations  as well as the laws and regulations of other countries 
fda approval process to obtain approval of a new drug product from the fda  we must  among other requirements  submit data supporting its safety and efficacy  as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the drug and proposed product labeling 
the testing and collection of data and the preparation of necessary applications are expensive and time consuming 
the fda may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications  and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain fda approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing mst or any other investigational agents 
the fda approval process relating to new drug products differs depending on the nature of the particular product candidate for which approval is sought 
with respect to any product candidate with api not previously approved by the fda eg  mst the sponsor is required to submit an nda that includes complete reports of pre clinical  clinical and laboratory studies and extensive manufacturing information to demonstrate the product s safety and effectiveness for its intended use 
on the other hand  if the api has been previously approved by the fda  such as with reformulation product candidates like anx and exelbine  the sponsor may be able to rely  in part  on the fda s findings of safety and efficacy with respect to the previously approved product 

table of contents the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the us generally involves the following completion of nonclinical laboratory and animal testing performed in compliance with fda regulations  submission of an investigational new drug application  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use  submission of an nda after completion of pivotal clinical trials  a determination by the fda within days of its receipt of the nda to file the nda for review  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the api and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug product in the us clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing  among other things  the objectives of the study  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety  and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated 
a protocol for each clinical study and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
the clinical testing of a drug product candidate generally is conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap or be combined 
the three phases are as follows phase in phase clinical studies  the product is tested in a small number of patients with the target condition or disease or in healthy volunteers 
these studies are designed to evaluate the safety  dosage tolerance  metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans  side effects associated with increasing doses  and  in some cases  to gain early evidence on efficacy 
the number of participants included in phase studies is generally in the range of to phase in phase studies  in addition to safety  the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product candidate on targeted indications to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
phase studies typically are larger than phase but smaller than phase studies and may involve several hundred participants 
phase phase studies typically involve an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed test sites 
they are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the product candidate has been obtained and are designed to further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety  to establish the overall benefit risk relationship of the product candidate and to provide an adequate basis for product approval 
phase studies usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants 
a clinical study may combine the elements of more than one phase and the fda generally requires two or more phase studies to support approval of a product candidate 
a company s designation of a clinical study as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that the study will be sufficient to satisfy the fda requirements of that phase because this determination cannot be made until the protocol and data have been submitted to and reviewed by the fda 
in addition  a clinical study may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the study as being of a particular phase 

table of contents a pivotal study is a clinical study that is believed to satisfy fda requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate s safety and efficacy such that it can be used  alone or with other pivotal or non pivotal studies  to justify regulatory approval 
generally  pivotal studies are phase studies  but they may be phase studies if the study design provides a well controlled and reliable assessment of clinical benefit  particularly in an area of unmet medical need 
clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the fda s good clinical practices  or gcp  requirements 
the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical study at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
an institutional review board  or irb  generally must approve the clinical trial design and patient informed consent at study sites that the irb oversees and also may halt a study  either temporarily or permanently  for failure to comply with the irb s requirements  or may impose other conditions 
additionally  some clinical studies are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor  known as a data safety monitoring board or committee 
this group recommends whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study 
the clinical study sponsor may also suspend or terminate a clinical study based on evolving business objectives  competitive climate and or lack of funds 
as a product candidate moves through the clinical testing phases  manufacturing processes are further defined  refined  controlled and validated 
the level of control and validation required by the fda increases as clinical studies progress 
we and the third party manufacturers on which we rely for the manufacture of our product candidates and their respective components including api are subject to requirements that drugs be manufactured  packaged and labeled in conformity with cgmp 
to comply with cgmp requirements  manufacturers must continue to spend time  money and effort to meet requirements relating to personnel  facilities  equipment  production and process  labeling and packaging  quality control  recordkeeping and other requirements 
assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements  detailed information on the product candidate is submitted to the fda in the form of an nda requesting approval to market the drug for one or more indications  together with payment of a user fee  unless waived 
an nda includes all relevant data available from pertinent nonclinical and clinical studies  including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings  together with detailed information on the chemistry  manufacture  controls cmc and proposed labeling  among other things 
to support marketing approval  the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use to the satisfaction of the fda 
if an nda submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the nda 
under the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  the fda s goal is to complete its initial review and respond to the applicant within months of submission  unless the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life threatening indication and is designated for priority review  in which case the goal may be within eight months of nda submission 
however  pdufa goal dates are not legal mandates and fda response often occurs several months beyond the original pdufa goal date 
further  the review process and the target response date under pdufa may be extended if the fda requests  or the nda sponsor otherwise provides  additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the nda 
the nda review process can  accordingly  be very lengthy 
during its review of an nda  the fda may refer the application to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee  but it typically follows such recommendations 
data from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the fda and or any advisory committee it appoints may interpret data differently than the nda sponsor 
after the fda evaluates the nda and inspects manufacturing facilities where the drug product and or its api will be produced  it will either approve commercial marketing of the drug product with prescribing information for specific indications or issue a complete response letter indicating that the application is not ready for approval and stating the conditions that must be met in order to secure approval of the nda 
if the complete response letter requires additional data and the applicant subsequently submits that data  the fda nevertheless may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy its criteria for approval 
the fda could also approve the nda with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategies  or rems  plan to mitigate risks  which could include medication guides  physician communication plans  or elements to assure safe use  such as restricted distribution methods  patient registries and other risk minimization tools 
the fda also may condition approval on  among other things  changes to proposed labeling  development of adequate controls and specifications  or a commitment to conduct post marketing testing 
such post marketing testing may include phase clinical studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product s safety and efficacy after approval 
regulatory approval of products for serious or life threatening indications may require that participants in clinical studies be followed for long periods to determine the overall survival benefit of the drug 

table of contents if the fda approves mst or another of our investigational drugs  we will be required to comply with a number of post approval regulatory requirements 
we would be required to report  among other things  certain adverse reactions and production problems to the fda  provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of our products 
also  quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cgmp after approval  and the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp  which imposes extensive procedural  substantive and record keeping requirements 
if we seek to make certain changes to an approved product  such as certain manufacturing changes  we will need fda review and approval before the change can be implemented 
for example  if we change the manufacturer of a product or its api  the fda may require stability or other data from the new manufacturer  which data will take time and is costly to generate  and the delay associated with generating this data may cause interruptions in our ability to meet commercial demand  if any 
while physicians may use products for indications that have not been approved by the fda  we may not label or promote the product for an indication that has not been approved 
securing fda approval for new indications is similar to the process for approval of the original indication and requires  among other things  submitting data from adequate and well controlled studies that demonstrate the product s safety and efficacy in the new indication 
even if such studies are conducted  the fda may not approve any change in a timely fashion  or at all 
we rely on third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material and we expect to rely on third party manufacturers to produce commercial quantities of our drugs  should they receive regulatory approval in the future 
future fda  state and or foreign governmental agency inspections may identify compliance issues at these third party facilities that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct 
in addition  discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product  manufacturer or holder of an approved nda  including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary  fda initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing 
newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product s approved labeling  including the addition of new warnings and contraindications  and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures 
many of the foregoing could limit the commercial value of a product or require us to commit substantial additional resources in connection with the approval of an investigational drug 
also  new government requirements  including those resulting from new legislation  may be established  or the fda s policies may change  which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development 
expedited review programs investigational drugs intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions with unmet medical needs may be eligible for certain programs intended to expedite or facilitate the process for fda review  such as the fast track and priority review programs 
fast track designation and priority review do not change the standards for fda approval but may expedite the approval process 
investigational drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition 
fast track designation applies to the combination of the drug and the specific indication for which it is being studied 
for a drug with fast track designation  the fda may consider a rolling review of the nda  meaning it may agree to review sections of the nda on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted  which could expedite the fda s review of the nda 
fast track designation  however  does not guarantee that the fda will agree to a rolling review of the nda 
an investigational drug is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products 
the fda will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an nda for a drug product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review 

table of contents orphan drug designation the orphan drug act  or oda  provides for granting special status  referred to as orphan designation  to a drug intended to treat  diagnose or prevent a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than  people in the us at the time of application for orphan designation 
orphan designation qualifies the sponsor of the product for the tax credit and marketing incentives of the oda 
orphan designation must be requested by an applicant before submitting its marketing application for that drug for an orphan disease or condition 
after the fda grants orphan designation  the generic identity of the orphan drug and its potential use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
the first sponsor to receive fda marketing approval for a drug with an orphan designation is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the us for that product for that indication and  typically  a waiver of the prescription drug user fee for its marketing application 
however  a drug that the fda considers to be clinically superior to  or different from  another approved orphan drug  even though for the same indication  may also obtain approval in the us during the seven year exclusive marketing period 
orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may also be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug 
the approval of an orphan designation request does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining marketing approval 
safety and efficacy of the product candidate must be established through adequate and well controlled studies 
legislation similar to the orphan drug act has been enacted in countries other than the us  including the european union 
the legislation in the european union is available for therapies addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of  persons 
the marketing exclusivity period is for ten years  although that period can be reduced to six years if  at the end of the fifth year  available evidence establishes that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity 
pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved drug products  including coding  coverage and payment 
sales of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will depend in part on reimbursement from third party payors 
third party payors include government health administrative authorities  managed care providers  private health insurers and other organizations 
the process for determining whether a payor will reimburse a product may be separate from the process of seeking approval of the product or for setting the price of the product 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services  in addition to their safety and efficacy 
even if reimbursement is provided  market acceptance of our products would be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use 
there have been federal and state proposals to subject the pricing of healthcare goods and services to government control and to make other changes to the us healthcare system 
we expect that federal  state and local governments in the us will continue to consider legislation directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare 
in addition  in certain foreign markets  the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient 
it is uncertain whether and how future legislation  whether domestic or abroad  could affect our products or product candidates or what actions federal  state  or private payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation 
other healthcare laws and compliance requirements in addition to fda requirements  several other types of state and federal laws apply and will apply to our operations 
these laws include healthcare information and data privacy protection laws and fraud and abuse laws  such as anti kickback and false claims statutes 
the federal healthcare program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for the purchase  lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers  purchasers and formulary managers on the other 
violations of the anti kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment  criminal fines  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
under the new physician payment sunshine act requirements  we will be subject in the future to reporting payments made to certain investigators and physicians 

table of contents federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to have a false claim paid 
recently  several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly promoting their products for uses for which they were not approved and causing the submission of claims for payment for such use under federal healthcare programs 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payor 
government regulation outside the us in addition to regulations in the us  we may be subject to a variety of regulations in foreign jurisdictions that govern  among other things  clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product candidate  we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries 
the foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the fda approval described above 
some foreign jurisdictions have a drug product approval process similar to that in the us  which requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the ind prior to the commencement of clinical studies 
in europe  for example  a clinical trial application  or cta  must be submitted to each country s national health authority and an independent ethics committee  much like the fda and irb  respectively 
once the cta is approved in accordance with a country s requirements  clinical trial development may proceed 
to obtain regulatory approval of a product candidate under european union regulatory systems  we would be required to submit a marketing authorization application  which is similar to the nda  except that  among other things  there are country specific document requirements 
for countries outside of the european union  such as countries in eastern europe  latin america or asia  the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies  product approval  pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country 
in addition  regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the us we face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to us or any future partner of ours 
if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements  we may be subject to  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses were million in and million in our research and development expenses for and consisted primarily of costs associated with external nonclinical activities  such as research related manufacturing  regulatory affairs and quality assurance related consulting services  and commercial readiness manufacturing for exelbine 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report for more information regarding our research and development expenses 
employees as of march   we have employees  of which are full time 
our employees are not unionized and we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 
our headcount has more than quadrupled since  as we built out our management team and filled key positions in clinical operations  cmc  regulatory affairs  and finance and accounting 
for at least the next few years  we plan to continue to operate by relying on a relatively small employee base and outsourcing key product development activities  including aspects of research related manufacturing  clinical operations and regulatory affairs  as well as general and administrative activities  such as human resources  facilities  internal systems support and investor relations

risk factors 
investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  operating results  growth prospects and financial condition are subject to various risks  many of which are not exclusively within our control  that may cause actual performance to differ materially from historical or projected future performance 
we urge you to consider carefully the risks described below  together with the other information in this report and our other public filings  before making investment decisions regarding our stock 
each of these risk factors  as well as additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  could adversely affect our business  operating results  growth prospects or financial condition  as well as the trading price of our common stock  in which case you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business risks related to our capital requirements  finances and operations we have incurred losses since our inception  we expect our operating expenses to continue to exceed our revenue for the foreseeable future  and we may never generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability 
we are a development stage company and have not generated sustainable revenue from operations or been profitable since inception  and we may never achieve profitability 
we have devoted our resources to acquiring and developing proprietary product candidates  but such product candidates cannot be marketed until the regulatory process is completed and governmental approvals have been obtained 
we have accumulated net losses totaling approximately million as of december   and we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years as we advance mst  our lead product candidate  through clinical studies and other development activities and seek approval from the fda to commercialize it 
accordingly  there is no current source of revenue from operations  much less profits  to sustain our present activities 
further  no revenue from operations will likely be available until  and unless  we enter into an arrangement that provides for third party funding of a development program or mst or another product candidate is approved by the fda or another regulatory agency  and successfully marketed  outcomes which we may not achieve 

table of contents the success of our business currently is dependent on the success of mst and this product candidate may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
we currently have no products for sale and we are focusing our resources almost exclusively on the development of mst accordingly  the success of our business currently depends on our ability  or that of a future partner  to successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for and then successfully commercialize this product candidate and our efforts  or those of a future partner  in this regard may prove unsuccessful 
mst requires considerable additional clinical development  including successful completion of epic  our ongoing phase clinical study in sickle cell disease  and significant manufacturing activities prior to commencing any commercial manufacturing  all of which require us to expend significant resources and with which we have limited experience 
mst may not be successful in epic  or in other clinical studies we initiate in sickle cell disease or other indications or  even if successful in clinical studies  may not receive regulatory approval in a timely manner  or at all 
if mst is approved by the fda or any foreign regulatory agency  our ability to generate revenue from it will depend in substantial part on the extent to which it is accepted by the medical community and reimbursed by third party payors  as well as our ability to market and sell the product and ensure that our third party manufacturers produce it in quantities sufficient to meet commercial demand  if any 
we will need to obtain additional funding to pursue our current business strategy and we may not be able to obtain such funding on a timely basis  or on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
any capital raising transaction we are able to complete may result in dilution to our existing stockholders  require us to relinquish significant rights or restrict our operations 
we anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  which were approximately million as of december   will be sufficient to fund our currently planned level of operations for at least the next months 
however  we may determine to grow our organization and or pursue development activities for mst or other product candidates at levels or on timelines  or we may incur unexpected expenses  that shorten the period through which our current operating funds will sustain us 
we may also seek to expand our product pipeline through acquisition of additional product candidates and or technologies and the cost to acquire and develop such new product candidates and or technologies may shorten the period through which our current operating funds will sustain us 
we do not expect to generate any substantial revenue from operations in the next several years  and we will need to obtain additional capital to support our planned operating activities 
for the foreseeable future  we likely will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity and debt financings and or through collaborations  such as licensing arrangements or partnering transactions  and may execute any such transaction at any time  subject to applicable laws and regulations 
although we were able to raise significant funds in the past through equity financings  the conditions of and our access to capital markets are highly variable and adequate additional financing may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  or on a timely basis  or at all 
further  each of these financing alternatives carries risks 
raising capital through the issuance of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock  may depress the market price of our stock and may substantially dilute our existing stockholders 
if instead we seek to raise capital through strategic transactions  such as licensing arrangements or sales of one or more of our technologies or product candidates  we may be required to relinquish valuable rights and dilute the current and future value of our assets 
for example  any licensing arrangement likely would require us to share with our licensee a significant portion of any revenues generated by our licensed technologies 
additionally  our control over the development and or marketing of any products or product candidates licensed or sold to third parties may be reduced and thus we may not realize the full value of any such products or product candidates 
debt financings could involve covenants that restrict our operations 
these restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of our assets  as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens or make investments and may  among other things  preclude us from making distributions to stockholders either by paying dividends or redeeming stock and taking other actions beneficial to our stockholders 
in addition  investors could impose more one sided investment terms and conditions on companies that have or are perceived to have limited remaining funds or limited ability to raise additional funds 
the lower our cash balance  the more difficult it is likely to be for us to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 

table of contents for particular development programs  such as development of mst for resuscitation of shock following major trauma  we plan to seek funding from the us government 
the process of obtaining government contracts is lengthy and uncertain and highly competitive 
in addition  changes in government budgets and agendas may result in decreased availability of drug research and development funding 
for example  on march   automatic  across the board federal budget cuts  known as sequestration  went into effect  which could significantly reduce funding for drug research and development programs and reduce the likelihood of our receipt of government funding in the future 
if we do secure government funding  the contracts for such funding may contain termination and audit provisions that are unfavorable to us and cause us to incur significant additional administrative expense 
in addition  the us government may require march in rights that allow it to grant licenses to inventions that arise from development programs it funds if  for example  we do not commercialize the technology within a certain timeframe or the government deems such action necessary to alleviate health or safety needs that are not being reasonably satisfied by us 
if the government exercises its march in rights  we could be obligated to license intellectual property developed by us on terms unfavorable to us and we may not receive compensation from the government for its exercise of such rights  which likely would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects 
notwithstanding any effort on our part to raise additional capital  adequate additional funding may not be available on acceptable terms  or on a timely basis  or at all 
even if we incur costs in pursuing  evaluating and negotiating particular capital raising and or strategic or partnering transactions  our efforts may not prove successful 
we believe global economic conditions  including the continued volatility of us and international equity markets  may adversely impact our ability to raise additional capital 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy 
the process of developing and seeking regulatory approval of investigational new drug products requires expenditure of substantial resources  and we cannot estimate with reasonable certainty the duration of or costs to complete our development programs 
our capital requirements for the foreseeable future will depend in large part on  and could increase significantly as a result of  our expenditures on our development programs 
future expenditures on our development programs are subject to many uncertainties  and will depend on  and could increase significantly as a result of  many factors  including the number and scope of development programs we pursue  the number of clinical and nonclinical studies necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a particular indication  the number of patients who participate in each clinical study  the number and location of sites included and the rate of site approval in each study  the rate of patient enrollment and ratio of randomized to evaluable patients in each clinical study  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the potential for additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies  the time and cost to manufacture clinical trial material and commercial product  including process development and scale up activities  and to conduct stability studies  which can last several years  the costs  requirements  timing of  and the ability to  secure regulatory approvals  the timing and terms of any collaborative or other strategic arrangement that we may establish  the extent to which we increase our workforce and the costs involved in recruiting  training and incentivizing new employees  
table of contents the costs related to developing  acquiring and or contracting for sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  supply chain management capabilities  and regulatory compliance capabilities  if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate and commercialize it without a partner  and the costs involved in establishing  enforcing or defending patent claims and other proprietary rights 
our ability to raise capital may be limited by applicable laws and regulations 
historically  we have raised capital through the sale of our equity securities 
between june and november  we completed seven equity financings under shelf registration statements on form s using a shelf registration statement on form s to raise additional capital generally takes less time and is less expensive than other means  such as conducting an offering under a form s registration statement 
however  in the future  our ability to raise capital using a shelf registration statement may be limited by  among other things  current sec rules and regulations 
under current sec rules and regulations  we must meet certain requirements to use a form s registration statement to raise capital without restriction as to the amount of the market value of securities sold thereunder 
one such requirement is that the market value of our outstanding common stock held by non affiliates  or public float  be at least million as of a date within days prior to the date of filing the form s if we do not meet that requirement  then the aggregate market value of securities sold by us or on our behalf under the form s in any month period is limited to an aggregate of one third of our public float 
moreover  even if we meet the public float requirement at the time we file a form s  sec rules and regulations require that we periodically re evaluate the value of our public float  and if  at a re evaluation date  our public float is less than million  we would become subject to the one third of public float limitation described above 
if our ability to utilize a form s registration statement for a primary offering of our securities is limited to one third of our public float  we may conduct such an offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of or under a form s registration statement  which we have done in the past  and we would expect either of those alternatives to increase the cost of raising additional capital relative to utilizing a form s registration statement 
in addition  under current sec rules and regulations  our common stock must be listed and registered on a national securities exchange in order to utilize a form s registration statement i for a primary offering  if our public float is not at least million as of a date within days prior to the date of filing the form s  or a re evaluation date  whichever is later  and ii to register the resale of our securities by persons other than us ie  a resale offering 
while currently our common stock is listed on the nyse mkt equities market  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing 
the nyse mkt reviews the appropriateness of continued listing of any issuer that falls below the exchange s continued listing standards 
previously  including during part of  we were not in compliance with certain nyse mkt continued listing standards and were at risk of having our common stock delisted from the nyse mkt equities market 
for additional information regarding this risk  see the risk factor below titled if we are unable to maintain compliance with nyse mkt continued listing standards  our common stock may be delisted from the nyse mkt equities market  which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline 
our ability to timely raise sufficient additional capital also may be limited by the nyse mkt s stockholder approval requirements for transactions involving the issuance of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock 
for instance  the nyse mkt requires that we obtain stockholder approval of any transaction involving the sale  issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock at a price less than the greater of book or market value  which together with sales by our officers  directors and principal stockholders equals or more of our then outstanding common stock  unless the transaction is considered a public offering by the nyse mkt staff 
based on the number of shares of our outstanding common stock as of march  and the closing price per share of our common stock on such date  which was  we could not raise more than approximately million without obtaining stockholder approval  unless the transaction is deemed a public offering or does not involve the sale  issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock at a price less than the greater of book or market value 
in addition  certain prior sales by us may be aggregated with any offering we may propose in the future  further limiting the amount we could raise in any future offering that is not considered a public offering by the nyse mkt staff and involves the sale  issuance or potential issuance by us of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock at a price less than the greater of book or market value 
the nyse mkt also requires that we obtain stockholder approval if the issuance or potential issuance of additional shares will be considered by the nyse mkt staff to result in a change of control of our company 

table of contents obtaining stockholder approval is a costly and time consuming process 
if we are required to obtain stockholder approval for a potential transaction  we would expect to spend substantial additional money and resources 
in addition  seeking stockholder approval would delay our receipt of otherwise available capital  which may materially and adversely affect our ability to execute our current business strategy  and there is no guarantee our stockholders ultimately would approve a proposed transaction 
a public offering under the nyse mkt rules typically involves broadly announcing the proposed transaction  which often times has the effect of depressing the issuer s stock price 
accordingly  the price at which we could sell our securities in a public offering may be less  and the dilution existing stockholders experience may in turn be greater  than if we were able to raise capital through other means 
if we are unable to raise sufficient additional capital as needed  we may be forced to delay  scale back or discontinue our development of mst  partner it at inopportune times or pursue less expensive but higher risk and or lower return development paths 
if we are not able to raise sufficient additional capital as needed  we may be required to delay  scale back or discontinue our development of mst or other programs  or to seek collaborators at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available 
for example  if we do not have sufficient capital  we may determine not to investigate certain additional indications for mst or to conduct other studies or activities intended to enhance our intellectual property position  improve the probability of regulatory approval  or expand the scope of mst s clinical benefit and market potential 
delays in and or reduction of development activities could impair our ability to realize the full clinical and market potential of a product candidate and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  discontinuation of a development program may be viewed negatively  which could adversely affect our stock price 
to the extent we discontinue independent development of a product candidate  we may not realize any value from our investment in the discontinued program 
even if we pursue a strategic option  such as partnering  selling or exclusively licensing the program to a third party  such an option may be not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
for example  in prior years  we were focused on developing exelbine and anx and expended significant resources on their development  however  in and  respectively  we elected to discontinue independent development of those programs 
although we are evaluating other opportunities for further development of those agents  such as partnering and licensing arrangements  none may be available and we may not realize any return on our investment in those programs 
our business may suffer if we are unable to retain and attract highly qualified personnel and manage internal growth 
currently  we have a small number of employees and we rely on third parties to perform many essential services for us 
our ability to execute on our business strategy and compete in the highly competitive biopharmaceutical  specialty pharmaceutical  pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
we are highly dependent on certain personnel  including our chief executive officer  our president and chief operating officer  our chief medical officer  and our senior vice president  development 
our industries in general and our company in particular historically have experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel 
if we lose any of our key employees  our ability to successfully implement our current business strategy could be seriously harmed 
replacing key employees may be a difficult  costly and protracted process  particularly due to the fact that we currently do not have other executive officers or personnel to assume all of the responsibilities of these key employees 
in addition  we may seek to increase the size of our organization as development of mst or another product candidate progresses 
competition for qualified personnel  particularly for key positions  is intense among companies in our field  universities and other research organizations  particularly in the san diego  california area  and many of the organizations against which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than our company  which may make them more attractive employers 
our ability to compete for qualified personnel may be adversely affected by our highly volatile stock price 
the value to employees of stock options we provide to retain and incentivize them is significantly affected by movements in our stock price that we cannot control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies 
all of our employees  including our executive officers  may terminate their employment with us at any time with or without notice 
if we cannot attract and retain skilled personnel  as needed  we may not achieve our development and other goals 

table of contents future internal growth could impose significant added responsibilities on our management  including the need to identify  recruit  maintain  motivate and integrate additional employees 
we may need to devote a significant amount of time to managing these activities and may not be able to do so effectively 
if we are unable to effectively manage future internal growth  our expenses may increase more than expected  we may not be able to achieve our development goals  and our ability to generate and or grow revenue could be diminished 
in the meantime  the success of our business also depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain relationships with respected service providers and industry leading consultants and advisers 
if we cannot develop and maintain such relationships  as needed  the rate and success at which we can develop and commercialize product candidates may be limited 
in addition  our outsourcing strategy  which has included engaging consultants that spend considerable time in our office to manage key functional areas  may subject us to scrutiny under labor laws and regulations  which may divert management time and attention and have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
if we determine to grow our business through the acquisition of new technologies and or product candidates  our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution  we may fail to realize the benefits of any future strategic acquisition or investment and we may incur unexpected costs and disruptions to our business 
although we are focused on developing mst  from time to time  we may evaluate pipeline expansion opportunities that we believe will increase the long term value of our company 
the process of identifying  evaluating  negotiating and implementing the purchase or license of new assets is lengthy and complex and may disrupt other development programs and distract our personnel 
we have limited resources with respect to identifying  evaluating  negotiating and implementing the acquisition of new assets or rights thereto and integrating them into our current infrastructure 
supplementing our current resources to complete one or more of these transactions may be costly 
we may use cash  shares of our common stock  securities convertible into our common stock or a combination of cash and our securities to pay the purchase price or license fee for any future strategic transaction 
the use of cash could negatively impact our financial position and ability to develop mst or any other product candidate 
the use of shares of our common stock or securities convertible into shares of our common stock would dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders and  given our recent market capitalization  such dilution could be substantial 
for example  in addition to the  outstanding shares we have issued to synthrx s former stockholders as consideration for our acquisition of synthrx that are outstanding  we could issue up to an aggregate of  additional shares of our common stock to such persons upon achievement of milestones related to the development and regulatory approval of mst for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children 
if those milestones are achieved  the number of shares issued and outstanding in connection with the synthrx acquisition would  in the aggregate  represent an approximately ownership stake in our company based on shares outstanding as of march  plus shares issued in connection with achievement of the milestones 
the issuance of shares in connection with other future strategic transactions  if any  may result in the stockholders who own the majority of our voting securities prior to one or more of such transactions owning less than a majority after such transactions 
further  strategic transactions may entail numerous operational and financial risks  including exposure to unknown liabilities  disruption of our business and diversion of our management s time and attention to develop and or commercialize acquired technologies and or products candidates  incurrence of substantial debt to pay for acquisitions  greater than anticipated difficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel  
table of contents impairment of relationships with key suppliers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership  and inability to retain key employees of any acquired business 
our stockholders will be required to rely on the judgment of our management and board of directors as to which new product candidates and or technologies we pursue and may have limited or no opportunity to evaluate potential new assets prior to completion of a transaction  including the terms of acquisition  the costs of their future development and their commercial potential 
we may devote resources to potential acquisition or in licensing opportunities that are never completed  or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts 
any technology and or product candidate that we acquire or to which we acquire rights likely will require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive clinical testing and approval by the fda and applicable foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are subject to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities and other risks described under the section titled risks related to drug development and commercialization 
we expend substantial resources to comply with laws and regulations relating to public companies  and any failure to maintain compliance could subject us to regulatory scrutiny and cause investors to lose confidence in our company  which could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
laws and regulations affecting public companies  including provisions of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of and the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  and the related rules and regulations adopted by the sec and by the nyse mkt have resulted in  and will continue to result in  significant costs to us as we evaluate the implications of these rules and respond to their requirements 
for example  compliance with section of sox  including performing the system and process documentation and evaluation necessary to issue our annual report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and  if applicable  obtain the required attestation report from our independent registered public accounting firm  requires us to incur substantial expense and expend significant management time 
further  we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of internal controls that need improvement 
if we identify deficiencies in our internal controls that are deemed to be material weaknesses  we could become subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities and lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls 
accordingly  even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis  or at all 
also  previously effective controls may become inadequate over time as a result of changes in our business or operating structure  and we may fail to take measures to evaluate the adequacy of and update these controls  as necessary  which could lead to a material misstatement 
in addition  new laws and regulations could make it more difficult or more costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including director and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the coverage that is the same or similar to our current coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or board committees  and as our executive officers 
we cannot predict or estimate with any reasonable accuracy the total amount or timing of the costs we may incur to comply with these laws and regulations 
our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income or future tax will be limited and may be limited further in the future due to changes in ownership within the meaning of irc section that have occurred and may occur in the future 
in general  under sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or irc  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating losses  or nols  and certain other tax assets to offset future taxable income  and an ownership change is generally defined as a cumulative change of or more in the ownership positions of certain stockholders during a rolling three year period 
we have identified several ownership changes within the meaning of irc section  with the most recent as a result of our november common stock and warrant financing 
as a result of these ownership changes  we do not expect to be eligible to utilize the nol carry forwards and research and development tax credits we had accumulated as of november  further ownership changes may occur in the future  which could eliminate or restrict our ability to use nol carry forwards and research and development tax credits generated after november  limitations on our ability to use nol carry forwards and research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income could require us to pay us federal income taxes earlier than would be required if such limitations were not in effect 
similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes 

table of contents our operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event 
our corporate headquarters are located in a single commercial facility in san diego  california 
important documents and records  including copies of our regulatory documents and other records for our product candidates  are located at our facilities and we depend on our facilities for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters and other catastrophic events  such as wildfires and other fires  earthquakes and extended power interruptions  which have impacted san diego businesses in the past  and terrorist attacks or severe weather conditions  could significantly disrupt our operations and result in additional  unplanned expense 
as a small company  we have limited capability to establish and maintain a comprehensive disaster recovery program and  accordingly  we do not have a formal business continuity or disaster recovery plan  and any natural disaster or catastrophic event could disrupt our business operations and result in setbacks to our development programs 
even though we believe we carry commercially reasonable insurance  we might suffer losses that are not covered by or exceed the coverage available under these insurance policies 
risks related to drug development and commercialization further testing and validation of our product candidates and related manufacturing processes are required and regulatory approval may be delayed or denied  which would delay or prevent us from marketing our product candidates and substantially harm our business 
human pharmaceutical products generally are subject to rigorous nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other approval procedures mandated by the fda and foreign regulatory authorities 
various federal and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
the process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate us and foreign statutes and regulations is time consuming and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in addition  these requirements and processes vary widely from country to country 
government regulation and the need for fda and other regulatory agency approval will delay commercialization of our product candidates  impose costly procedures upon our activities  and may put us at a disadvantage relative to other companies with which we compete 
there can be no assurance that fda or any other regulatory agency will grant marketing approval for mst or any of our product candidates on a timely basis  or at all  including due to factors not within our control 
for example  the sequester that took effect on march  may result in significant reductions to the fda s budget  which may lead to slower response times and longer review periods  potentially affecting our ability to progress development of or obtain approval for mst clinical studies typically involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome 
clinical testing typically is expensive and can take years to complete  and its outcome is inherently uncertain 
clinical studies may not commence on time or be completed on schedule  if at all 
the commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a variety of reasons  including difficulties and delays related to obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical study  obtaining institutional review board  or irb  approval to conduct a clinical study at a prospective site  identifying appropriate study sites and reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective study sites and investigators  the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among study sites  
table of contents reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations  or cros  for the conduct of clinical studies and contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos  for the production of clinical trial material  the terms of which agreements can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and cmos  failures on the part of our cros and cmos in developing procedures and protocols or otherwise conducting activities on timelines requested by us  identifying and hiring or engaging  as applicable  additional employees or consultants to assist us in managing cro and or cmo activities  managing a clinical study and analyzing the data resulting from a study  recruiting and enrolling patients to participate in a clinical study  manufacturing sufficient quantities of clinical trial material due  among other things  to lack of availability of capacity at a cmo or of the component materials  including the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  having patients complete a study and or return for and complete post treatment follow up  and unforeseen results from other clinical studies or nonclinical testing that require us to amend a study design or halt or terminate a clinical study 
patient enrollment  a significant factor in the time required to complete a clinical study  is affected by many factors  including the size and nature of the study subject population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the design of the clinical study  competing clinical studies and clinicians and patients perceptions as to the potential advantages of the drug being studied in relation to available alternatives  including therapies being investigated by other companies 
further  completion of a clinical study and or its results may be adversely affected by failure to retain subjects who enroll in a study but withdraw due to adverse side effects  lack of efficacy  improvement in condition before treatment has been completed or for personal issues or who fail to return for or complete post treatment follow up 
in addition  a clinical study may be suspended or terminated by us  an irb  a data safety monitoring board  the fda or other regulatory authorities due to a number of factors  including failure to conduct the study in accordance with regulatory requirements or the study s protocol  inspection of clinical study operations or sites by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold  unforeseen safety issues  including adverse side effects  changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions  or lack of adequate funding to continue the study 
changes in governmental regulations and guidance relating to clinical studies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes 
amendments may require us to resubmit protocols to irbs for reexamination or renegotiate terms with cros and study sites and investigators  all of which may adversely impact the costs or timing of or our ability to successfully complete a trial 

table of contents clinical studies may not begin on time or be completed in the timeframe we anticipate for a variety of reasons  including one or more of those described above 
there can be no assurance that any of our future clinical studies will commence  or ongoing studies be completed  as planned 
for example  although we expect to move mst directly into phase studies for most new indications we plan to pursue  an irb or the fda or another regulatory agency may require additional clinical or nonclinical studies prior to initiation of any planned phase study  which likely would increase the total time and cost of development in that indication 
in addition  the length of time necessary to complete clinical studies varies significantly and is difficult to predict accurately 
we may make statements regarding anticipated timing for completion of enrollment in and or availability of results from our clinical studies  but such predictions are subject to a number of significant assumptions and actual timing may differ materially for a variety of reasons including the factors described above 
if we experience delays in the completion of a clinical study or if a clinical study is terminated  the commercial prospects for our product candidate may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue will be delayed 
in addition  any delays in completing our clinical studies likely will increase our development costs 
further  many of the factors that cause  or lead to  a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical studies may ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of a product candidate 
even if we are able to ultimately commercialize our product candidates  other therapies for the same indications may be introduced to the market in the interim and establish a competitive advantage or diminish the need for our products 
positive results in nonclinical testing and prior clinical studies do not ensure that future clinical studies will be successful or that our product candidates will receive the regulatory approvals necessary for their commercialization 
before obtaining regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our product candidates  we must demonstrate through nonclinical testing and clinical studies that each product is safe and effective for use in each target indication 
based on extensive nonclinical testing  we believe we understand mst s mechanism of action  however  previously observed pharmacologic effects and clinical benefits may not be observed in ongoing or future nonclinical or clinical studies 
success in nonclinical testing and prior clinical studies does not ensure that subsequent or larger scale studies will be successful 
for example  non purified poloxamer was tested in more than  human subjects in various indications before the program was discontinued  principally due to concerns regarding acute renal dysfunction observed in patients who received the study drug 
in contrast  mst was generally well tolerated in six prior clinical studies and no clinically significant changes in renal function were observed 
however  patient safety concerns may be observed in ongoing or future clinical studies  including epic and the tqt study 
with respect to efficacy  although there is compelling data from nonclinical and clinical studies of poloxamer in multiple indications  ongoing and future studies may fail to demonstrate clinical benefits to human subjects 
further  clinical study results frequently are susceptible to varying interpretations 
medical professionals  investors and or regulatory authorities may analyze or weigh study data differently than we do 
in addition  determining the value of clinical data typically requires application of assumptions and extrapolations to raw data 
alternative methodologies may lead to differing conclusions  including with respect to the safety or efficacy of our product candidates 
for example  alternative methods for applying missing or imputed data may have impacted the treatment effect observed in the prior sponsor phase study of mst in sickle cell disease 
if regulatory authorities disagree with us as to the appropriate methods for analyzing study data  regulatory approval for our product candidates may be delayed  limited or withheld 
for instance  despite positive nonclinical testing that indicated bioequivalence between anx and the reference product  taxotere  our bioequivalence study of anx did not demonstrate bioequivalence between anx and taxotere based on the fda s benchmark regulatory standards and the fda determined anx could not be approved based on the findings from that study 
in addition  if we license to third parties rights to develop our product candidates in other geographic areas or in other indications  we may have limited control over nonclinical testing or clinical studies that may be conducted by such third party licensees in those territories or indications 
if data from third party testing identifies a safety or efficacy concern  such data could adversely affect our or another licensee s development of mst for example  we have licensed to a third party certain rights to anx in south korea and have limited control over any nonclinical testing or clinical studies that may be conducted by such third party or a future third party licensee 
if data from investigations of anx sponsored by a third party licensee identify a safety or efficacy concern with respect to anx  or the lack of comparable pharmacokinetics between anx and taxotere  such data could adversely affect the us regulatory process for anx there is significant risk that mst could fail to show anticipated results in nonclinical testing and or clinical studies and  as a result  we may elect to discontinue its development in a particular indication or in whole 
a failure to obtain requisite regulatory approvals or to obtain approvals of the scope requested will delay or preclude us from marketing our products or limit the commercial use of the products  and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we do not have  and do not have plans to establish  any manufacturing facilities and are dependent on third parties for the manufacture and supply of mst  and the loss of any of these manufacturers  or their failure to provide to us with an adequate supply of drug product in a timely manner and on commercially acceptable terms  or at all  could harm our business 
we do not have  and do not have plans to establish  our own manufacturing facilities 
for mst clinical trial material  we have entered into supply agreements with pierre fabre m dicament pfm for api and patheon inc for finished drug product  but our current agreements may not cover all of our clinical trial material needs and we may need to negotiate new or amended agreements with these cmos or rely on individual proposals or statements of work  which inherently involves uncertainty as to ongoing supply and may result in delays in the completion of ongoing clinical studies or initiation of new studies 
in addition  as development of mst progresses  we will need to negotiate agreements for its commercial supply 
if we fail to maintain relationships with our current cmos  we may not be able to complete development of mst or market it  if approved  on a timely basis  or at all  which would have a material and adverse effect on our business 
third party manufacturers and suppliers may not perform as agreed or may terminate their agreements with us 
for example  because these third parties provide manufacturing services to a number of other pharmaceutical companies  they may experience capacity constraints or choose to prioritize one or more of their other customers over us 
any significant problem that our manufacturers or suppliers experience could delay or interrupt our supply of clinical trial material or commercial product until the manufacturer or supplier cures the problem or until we locate  negotiate for and validate an alternative source of supply  if one is available 
in addition to our reliance on third parties to manufacture clinical trial material  we rely on them to conduct or assist us in conducting key manufacturing development activities  including qualification of equipment  developing and validating methods  defining critical process parameters  releasing component materials and conducting stability testing  among other things 
if these third parties are unable to perform successfully in a timely manner  whether for technical  financial or other reasons  we may be unable to secure clinical trial material  which likely would delay the initiation  conduct or completion of our clinical studies  which  in turn  likely would have a material and adverse effect on our business 
all manufacturers of our clinical trial material and  as applicable  commercial product  including the api manufacturers  must comply with cgmp requirements enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program and applicable requirements of foreign regulatory authorities 
these requirements include quality control  quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturers of our clinical trial material may be unable to comply with these cgmp requirements and with other fda  state and foreign regulatory requirements 
while we or our representatives generally monitor and audit our manufacturers systems  we have little control over their ongoing compliance with these regulations 
failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties  suspension of production  suspension or delay in product approval  product seizure or recall  or withdrawal of product approval 
currently  we do not anticipate engaging alternative sources to backup our primary sources of clinical trial material and  in the future  we may not engage backup sources for commercial product 
therefore  if our primary sources become unable or unwilling to perform  we could experience protracted delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial material and  ultimately  product for commercial sale  which could materially and adversely affect our development programs  commercial activities  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if we are unable to maintain our relationship with pfm  we may be unable to identify or establish a relationship with an alternate cmo that has the technical capabilities and desire to perform the development and supply services that we require for mst api on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
production of purified poloxamer  the api in mst  requires application of our proprietary supercritical fluid extraction process 
this extraction process is complex and requires highly specialized equipment and there are a limited number of cmos capable of performing and willing to perform the process as we require  which makes identifying and establishing relationships with cmos more difficult and may provide them with substantial leverage over us in any negotiations 
in addition  we use commercially available poloxamer as api starting material 
there are a limited number of sources of poloxamer  and we are not aware of any that manufacture it to cgmp requirements applicable to api 
the current supplier of our api starting material manufactures it under excipient grade cgmp conditions 
prior to approval of mst  the fda or other regulatory agencies may require our api starting material to be manufactured consistent with cgmp requirements applicable to api  in which case regulatory approval and commercialization of mst could be delayed significantly and require substantial additional financial resources as we seek to contract with a third party to manufacture poloxamer consistent with cgmp requirements applicable to api or undertake to manufacture it ourselves  and conduct any additional clinical or nonclinical activities with such material as the fda may require 
even if the fda accepts our current approach with respect to api starting material  we do not have a direct relationship with the supplier of that starting material and  although that third party has extensive  worldwide operations and poloxamer is part of its standard product portfolio  we do not have any control over its production and the supplier may change its manufacturing process and or limit the availability of its poloxamer product in the future 
if the supplier makes changes to its poloxamer product  the fda may determine that it is not acceptable api starting material and we may have difficulty obtaining an alternate supply of api starting material that the fda finds acceptable without our conducting additional clinical or nonclinical activities or taking other remedial measures  which could require substantial time and financial resources 
as a result  we could experience significant disruption in our ability to manufacture mst  which likely would add significant cost to the overall development and commercialization of mst and adversely affect our ability to develop mst on a timely basis 

table of contents any new manufacturer or supplier of finished drug product or its component materials  including api  would be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements and would need to have sufficient rights under applicable intellectual property laws to the method of manufacturing such product or ingredients 
the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical studies  collect stability data and provide additional information concerning any new supplier  or change in a validated manufacturing process  including scaling up production  before we could distribute products from that manufacturer or supplier or revised process 
for example  if we were to engage a third party other than pfm to supply api for future mst clinical trial material or commercial product  the fda may require us to conduct additional clinical and nonclinical studies to ensure comparability of the drug product containing pfm manufactured api to api manufactured by the new supplier 
in addition to the potential for such requirements to result in significant interruption to development and commercialization of mst  we likely would incur substantial additional costs to comply with the additional requirements 
the manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment  including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
manufacturers of pharmaceutical products often encounter difficulties in production  particularly in scaling up initial production 
these problems include difficulties with production costs and yields  quality control  including stability of the product candidate and quality assurance testing  and shortages of qualified personnel 
none of our product candidates  including mst  has been manufactured at the scale we believe will be necessary to maximize its commercial value and  accordingly  we may encounter difficulties in attempting to scale up production and may not succeed in that effort 
in addition  the fda or other regulatory authorities may impose additional requirements as we scale up initial production capabilities  which may delay our scale up activities or add expense 
if our manufacturers encounter any of these difficulties or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations  we may have insufficient quantities of clinical trial material for our clinical studies  including our ongoing studies 
in addition  any delay or interruption in the supply of materials necessary or useful to manufacture our product candidates could delay the completion of our clinical studies  increase the costs associated with our development programs and  depending upon the period of delay  require us to commence new clinical studies at significant additional expense or terminate the studies completely 
we cannot ensure that manufacturing or quality control problems will not arise in connection with the manufacture of our clinical trial material  or that third party manufacturers will be able to maintain the necessary governmental licenses and approvals to continue manufacturing such clinical trial material 
in addition  pfm and patheon are located in france and italy  respectively  and  as a result  we may experience interruptions in supply due to shipping or customs difficulties or regional instability 
any of the above factors could cause us to delay or suspend anticipated or on going trials  regulatory submissions or commercialization of our product candidates  entail higher costs or result in our being unable to effectively commercialize our products 
our dependence upon third parties for the manufacture of our clinical trial material may adversely affect our future costs and our ability to develop and commercialize mst and any other product candidate on a timely and competitive basis 

table of contents we rely significantly on third parties to conduct our nonclinical testing and clinical studies and other aspects of our development programs and if those third parties do not satisfactorily perform their contractual obligations or meet anticipated deadlines  the development of our product candidates could be adversely affected 
we do not employ personnel or possess the facilities necessary to conduct many of the activities associated with our programs 
we engage consultants  advisors  cros  cmos and others to assist in the design and conduct of nonclinical and clinical studies of our product candidates and with interpretation of the results of those studies  and we expect to continue to outsource a significant amount of such activities 
as a result  many important aspects of our development programs are and will continue to be outside our direct control 
consultants and contractors may not be as committed to the success of our programs as employees and  therefore  may not be willing to devote the same time  thoughtfulness or creativity as would an employee 
there can be no assurance that such third parties will perform all of their obligations under arrangements with us or will perform those obligations satisfactorily 
the cros that we engage to execute our clinical studies play a significant role in the conduct of the studies and subsequent collection and analysis of data  and we likely will depend on cros and clinical investigators to conduct future clinical studies and to assist in analyzing completed studies and developing regulatory strategies for our product candidates 
individuals working at the cros with which we contract  as well as investigators at the sites at which our studies are conducted  are not our employees  and we have limited control over the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
if these cros and or investigators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our studies  if they do not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or if their performance is substandard  it will delay the approval of our applications to regulatory agencies and the introduction of our products 
moreover  these cros may have relationships with other commercial entities  some of which may compete with us 
if they assist our competitors at our expense  it could harm our competitive position 
failure of these cros to meet their obligations could adversely affect development of our product candidates 
for example  in  we engaged a cro to assist with the primary conduct of our bioequivalence study of exelbine  including monitoring participating clinical sites to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements 
fda guidance recommends that clinical sites randomly select and retain reserve samples of study drugs used in bioequivalence studies 
however  the clinical sites that participated in our bioequivalence study of exelbine failed to do so 
in august  we received a complete response letter from the fda stating that the authenticity of the study drugs used in that bioequivalence study could not be verified and  consequently  the study would need to be repeated to address that deficiency 
if any of our cro relationships were to terminate  in particular our relationship with theradex systems  inc  the cro we engaged to conduct the epic study  we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative cros on acceptable terms or in a timely manner  or at all 
switching cros would involve additional cost and divert management time and attention 
in addition  there likely would be a transition period when a new cro commences work 
these challenges could result in delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical studies  which could materially impact our ability to meet our desired development timelines and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition 
our product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval or commercialization 
undesirable side effects caused by our product candidates could interrupt  delay or halt clinical studies and could result in the denial of regulatory approval by the fda or other regulatory authorities for any or all indications  and in turn prevent us from commercializing our product candidates 
for example  while we believe our proprietary purification process has addressed the cause of the acute renal dysfunction observed in clinical studies of non purified poloxamer  we cannot provide assurance that the purification process has fully addressed the issue or that renal toxicity will not be observed in ongoing or future studies of mst  particularly if we conduct studies in patients with impaired renal function 
in addition  transient  generally mild to moderate elevations in liver function tests were associated with treatment with mst in prior clinical studies 
if in our clinical studies of mst we observe more pronounced increases in liver function tests  or we observe other previously unidentified adverse events  whether or not statistically significant  we may be required to conduct additional clinical studies of mst or to investigate the clinical significance of the adverse event and mst may not receive regulatory approval 

table of contents if any of our product candidates receive marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by the product or  if applicable  the reference product regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements  such as a black box warning or a contraindication  regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product  we may be required to change the way the product is administered  conduct additional clinical studies or change the labeling of the product  and our reputation may suffer 
any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing the product  which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from its sale 
we may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we announce 
we set goals for and make public statements regarding our estimates of the timing for accomplishing certain objectives material to successful development of our product candidates 
the actual timing of these events can vary  sometimes dramatically  due to many factors  including delays or failures in our nonclinical testing  clinical studies and manufacturing and regulatory activities and the uncertainties inherent in the regulatory approval process 
for example  we had expected to initiate the epic study in  but unforeseen delays related to the manufacture of clinical trial material delayed initiation of the study to for additional discussion of these risks  see the risk factors above in this section  risks related to drug development and commercialization 
even if we complete a clinical study with successful results  we may not achieve our projected development goals in the time frames we initially anticipate or announce 
the fda may require nonclinical testing and or clinical studies in addition to epic and the tqt study prior to its review or approval of mst in sickle cell disease 
if the development plan for mst or any other product candidate becomes more extensive and costly than anticipated  we may determine that the associated time and cost are not financially justifiable and  as a result  discontinue development in a particular indication or of the product candidate as a whole 
any such action may be viewed negatively  which could adversely affect our stock price 
in addition  changes may occur in regulatory requirements or policy during the period of product development and or regulatory review of a submitted nda relating to the data required to be included in marketing applications 
for example  despite including in our initial exelbine nda submission in december data that we believe met the filing requirements for a new drug promulgated by the international conference on harmonization  or ich  as well as site specific stability data from lots manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing site  we received a refusal to file letter from the fda indicating that the data included in that submission was insufficient to support a commercially viable expiration dating period 
consequently  we had to generate months of stability data from material manufactured at our intended commercial manufacturing site before resubmitting the exelbine nda  which we did in november a change in regulatory policy  which may not have been formalized or publicly disseminated  may have been a factor underlying the fda s refusal to file our december submission 
further  throughout development  we must provide adequate assurance to the fda and other regulatory authorities that we can consistently produce our product candidates in conformance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and other regulatory standards 
we rely on cmos for the manufacture of clinical  and future commercial  quantities of our product candidates 
if future fda or other regulatory authority inspections identify cgmp compliance issues at these third party facilities  production of our clinical trial material or  in the future  commercial product  could be disrupted  causing potentially substantial delay in development or commercialization of our product candidates 

table of contents even if we receive regulatory approval for mst or another product candidate  we may face development and regulatory difficulties that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
even if initial regulatory approval is obtained  or as a condition to the initial approval  the fda or a foreign regulatory agency may impose significant restrictions on a product s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post approval studies or marketing surveillance programs  any of which would limit the commercial potential of the product 
our product candidates also will be subject to ongoing fda requirements related to the manufacturing processes  labeling  packaging  storage  distribution  advertising  promotion  record keeping and submission of safety and other post market information regarding the product 
for instance  the fda may require changes to approved drug labels  require post approval clinical studies and impose distribution and use restrictions on certain drug products 
in addition  approved products  manufacturers and manufacturers facilities are subject to continuing regulatory review and periodic inspections 
if previously unknown problems with a product are discovered  such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  the fda may impose restrictions on that product or us  including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we or a cmo of ours fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory agency may issue warning letters or untitled letters  impose civil or criminal penalties  suspend or withdraw regulatory approval  suspend or terminate any ongoing clinical studies  refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications  exclude our product from reimbursement under government healthcare programs  including medicaid or medicare  impose restrictions or affirmative obligations on our or our cmo s operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  close the facilities of a cmo  or seize or detain products or require a product recall 
we currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales capability and our failure to acquire or develop these and related capabilities internally or contract with third parties to perform these activities successfully could delay and or limit our ability to generate revenue in the event mst or any other product candidate obtains regulatory approval 
we currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales capability and our company has never marketed or sold products 
to commercialize mst or any other product candidate  we will have to acquire or develop marketing  distribution  sales and associated regulatory compliance capabilities  or rely on marketing partners or other third parties for the marketing  distribution and sale of our products 
there is no guarantee that we will be able to establish adequate marketing  distribution or sales capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform those activities on terms satisfactory to us  or at all  or that any internal capabilities or third party arrangements will be cost effective 
the acquisition or development of commercialization and associated regulatory compliance capabilities likely will require substantial financial and other resources and divert the attention of our management and key personnel  and  if not completed on time  could delay the launch of an approved product  and otherwise negatively impact our product development and commercialization efforts 

table of contents to the extent we establish marketing  distribution or sales arrangements with third parties  those third parties may hold significant control over important aspects of the commercialization of our products  including market identification  marketing methods  pricing  composition of sales force and promotional activities 
even if we are successful in establishing and maintaining these arrangements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to control the amount and timing of resources that any third party may devote to our products or prevent any third party from pursuing alternative technologies or products that could result in the development of products that compete with  or the withdrawal of support for  our products 
if we retain third party service providers to perform functions related to the marketing  distribution and sale of our products  key aspects of those functions that may be out of our direct control could include warehousing and inventory management  distribution  contract administration and chargeback processing  accounts receivable management and call center management 
in this event  we would place substantial reliance on third party providers to perform services for us  including entrusting our inventories of products to their care and handling 
if these third party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  fail to meet expected deadlines  encounter natural or other disasters at their facilities or otherwise fail to perform in a satisfactory manner  or at all  our ability to deliver product to meet commercial demand could be significantly impaired 
in addition  we may use third parties to perform various other services for us relating to sample accountability and regulatory monitoring  including adverse event reporting  safety database management and other product maintenance services 
if the quality or accuracy of the data maintained by these service providers is insufficient  our ability to continue to market our products could be jeopardized or we could be subject to regulatory sanctions 
if any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval fails to achieve significant market acceptance among the medical community  patients or third party payors  the revenue we generate from its sales will be limited and our business may not be profitable 
our success will depend in substantial part on the extent to which our products candidates  if approved  are accepted by the medical community and patients and reimbursed by third party payors  including government payors 
the degree of market acceptance with respect to each of our approved products  if any  will depend upon a number of factors  including the safety and efficacy of our product demonstrated in clinical studies  acceptance in the medical and patient communities of our product as a safe and effective treatment  the perceived advantages of our product over alternative treatments  including with respect to the incidence and severity of any adverse side effects and the cost of treatment  the indications for which our product is approved  claims or other information including limitations or warnings in our product s approved labeling  reimbursement and coverage policies of government and other third party payors  pricing and cost effectiveness of our product relative to alternative treatments  availability of alternative treatments  the prevalence of off label substitution of chemically equivalent products or alternative treatments  and the resources we devote to marketing our product and restrictions on promotional claims we can make with respect to the product 
we cannot predict with reasonable accuracy whether physicians  patients  healthcare insurers or maintenance organizations  or the medical community in general  will accept or utilize any of our products 
if our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by these parties  we may not generate sufficient revenue to become or remain profitable 
in addition  our efforts to educate the medical community and third party payors regarding benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful 

table of contents if we determine that a product candidate may not achieve adequate market acceptance or that the potential market size does not justify additional expenditure on the program  we may reduce our expenditures on the development and or the process of seeking regulatory approval of the product candidate while we evaluate whether and on what timeline to move the program forward 
even if we receive regulatory approval to market one or more of our product candidates in the us  we may never receive approval or commercialize our products outside of the us  which would limit our ability to realize the full commercial potential of our product candidates 
in order to market any products outside of the us  we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
the regulatory approval process in other countries may include all of the risks detailed above regarding fda approval in the us  as well as other risks 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others 
failure to obtain regulatory approval in other countries or any delay or setback in obtaining such approval could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding fda approval in the us as described above  such effects include the risks that our product candidates may not be approved for all indications requested  which could limit the uses of our product candidates and have an adverse effect on product sales  and that such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or require costly  post marketing follow up studies 
risks related to our intellectual property our success will depend on patents and other intellectual property protection we obtain that cover our product candidates and proprietary technology 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other exclusivity with respect to our products  prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights  maintain proprietary know how and trade secrets  operate without infringing upon the patents and proprietary rights of others  and obtain appropriate licenses to patents or proprietary rights held by third parties if infringement would otherwise occur  both in the us and in foreign countries 
the patent and intellectual property positions of biopharmaceutical companies  including ours  are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
there is no guarantee that we have or will develop or obtain the rights to products or processes that are patentable  that patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed will be sufficient to protect the technology we develop or have developed or that is used by us  our cmos or our other service providers 
in addition  any patents that are issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  infringed or circumvented  including by our competitors  and rights we have under issued patents may not provide competitive advantages to us 
patent applications in the us are confidential for a period of time until they are published  and publication of discoveries in scientific or patent literature typically lags actual discoveries by several months 
as a result  we cannot be certain that the inventors listed in any patent or patent application owned by us were the first to conceive of the inventions covered by such patents and patent applications for us patent applications filed before march   or that such inventors were the first to file patent applications for such inventions outside the united states and  after march   in the united states 

table of contents we also rely on unpatented know how and trade secrets and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  collaborators and others 
we also have invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and certain consultants 
there can be no assurance  however  that binding agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that trade secrets or other proprietary information will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
in addition  it is possible that inventions relevant to our business could be developed by a person not bound by an invention assignment agreement with us 
with respect to mst  we acquired exclusive rights to a variety of issued patents related to poloxamers and their uses 
however  we expect many of the patents will expire prior to our obtaining regulatory approval for mst for exclusivity in sickle cell disease  we expect to rely primarily on the orphan drug designation that the fda has granted for poloxamer purified for the treatment of sickle cell disease  which includes the treatment and prevention of the complications of sickle cell disease 
however  the orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review or approval process 
mst may not receive the seven year orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is not the first poloxamer drug product to obtain fda marketing approval for the treatment of sickle cell disease 
in addition  orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug 
furthermore  if the fda later determines another drug or biologic for the treatment of sickle cell disease to be clinically superior to or different from mst  the fda may approve such other product candidate for marketing during mst s seven year exclusivity period 
our success depends in large part on our ability to prevent competitors from duplicating or developing equivalent versions of our product candidates  but patent protection for mst may be difficult to obtain and any issued claims may be limited due to the extent of published literature regarding the use of poloxamer we have filed for patent protection covering our proprietary supercritical fluid extraction process  methods of using poloxamers in various clinical settings  and the use of poloxamers in combination therapy 
however  these patent applications cover only methods of manufacturing  methods of using mst  and combination therapeutic methods  they do not cover the underlying api 
claims covering the api are widely viewed as the strongest form of intellectual property protection for pharmaceutical products  as they apply without regard to how the api is manufactured  used or formulated 
the potential therapeutic benefits of poloxamer have been known for decades and there is substantial prior art describing the use of poloxamer in a wide range of diseases and conditions 
as a result  our ability to find novel and non obvious uses of poloxamer is limited 
further  a patent examiner may combine numerous  disparate references in order to reject a claimed use for obviousness 
if the prior art suggests  even implicitly  the desirability of combining previously known elements  such as the use of poloxamer in a particular indication  the subsequent use of mst in that indication may be obvious 
we cannot provide assurance that our pending patent applications will issue as patents  that any issued patents will provide us with significant competitive advantages  or that the validity or enforceability of any of our patents will not be challenged or  if instituted  that these challenges will not be successful 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of our patents could be substantial 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurance that others will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of our technologies 
we can provide no assurance that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or rights owned by others  licenses to which might not be available to us 
if we are sued for infringing the proprietary rights of third parties  it will be costly and time consuming  and an unfavorable outcome would have an adverse effect on our business 
our commercial success depends on our ability and the ability of our cmos and component suppliers to develop  manufacture  market and sell our products and product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications  which are owned by third parties  exist in the fields in which we are or may be developing products 
as the industries in which we operate biopharmaceutical  specialty pharmaceutical  biotechnology and pharmaceutical expand and more patents are issued  the risk increases that we will be subject to claims that our products or product candidates  or their use or manufacture  infringe the rights of others 
because patent applications can take many years to publish and issue  there currently may be pending applications  unknown to us  that may later result in issued patents that our products  product candidates or technologies infringe  or that the process of manufacturing our products or any of their respective component materials  or the component materials themselves  infringe  or that the use of our products  product candidates or technologies infringe 

table of contents we or our cmos or component material suppliers may be exposed to  or threatened with  litigation by third parties alleging that our products  product candidates and or technologies infringe their patents and or other intellectual property rights  or that one or more of the processes for manufacturing our products or any of their respective component materials  or the component materials themselves  or the use of our products  product candidates or technologies  infringe their patents and or other intellectual property rights 
if a third party patent or other intellectual property right is found to cover our products  product candidates  technologies or their uses  or any of the underlying manufacturing processes or components  we could be required to pay damages and could be unable to commercialize our products or use our technologies or methods unless we are able to obtain a license to the patent or intellectual property right 
a license may not be available to us in a timely manner or on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  during litigation  the third party alleging infringement could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable remedy that could prohibit us from making  using or selling our products  technologies or methods 
there generally is a substantial amount of litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the industries in which we operate 
if a third party claims that we or our cmos or component material suppliers infringe its intellectual property rights  we may face a number of issues  including  but not limited to infringement and other intellectual property claims which  with or without merit  may be expensive and time consuming to litigate and may divert our management s time and attention from our core business  substantial damages for infringement  including the potential for treble damages and attorneys fees  which we may have to pay if it is determined that the product at issue infringes or violates the third party s rights  a court prohibiting us from selling or licensing the product unless the third party licenses its intellectual property rights to us  which it may not be required to do  if a license is available from the third party  we may have to pay substantial royalties  fees and or grant cross licenses to the third party  and redesigning our products or processes so they do not infringe  which may not be possible or may require substantial expense and time 
no assurance can be given that patents do not exist  have not been filed  or could not be filed or issued  which contain claims covering our products  product candidates or technology or those of our cmos or component material suppliers or the use of our products  product candidates or technologies 
because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in the industries in which we operate  there is a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing our products  product candidates or technologies  or those of our cmos or component material suppliers  or uses of our products  product candidates or technologies 
in addition  it may be necessary for us to enforce our proprietary rights  or to determine the scope  validity and unenforceability of other parties proprietary rights  through litigation or other dispute proceedings  which may be costly and adversely affect our rights 
any such proceeding may be costly and  to the extent we are unsuccessful  adversely affect our rights 
in these proceedings  a court or administrative body could determine that our claims  including those related to enforcing patent rights  are not valid or that an alleged infringer has not infringed our rights 
the uncertainty resulting from the mere institution and continuation of any patent or other proprietary rights related litigation or interference proceeding could have a material and adverse effect on us 

table of contents risks related to our industry we expect intense competition in the marketplace for our product candidates  should any of them receive regulatory approval 
the industries in which we operate biopharmaceutical  specialty pharmaceutical  biotechnology and pharmaceutical are highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant change 
we are aware of many other organizations developing drug products and other therapies intended to treat or cure the diseases or conditions in which we are developing or plan to develop mst developments by others may render potential application of mst in a particular indication obsolete or noncompetitive  even prior to completion of its development and approval for that indication 
if successfully developed and approved  we expect mst will face intense competition with respect to each indication in which it is approved 
we may not be able to compete successfully against organizations with competitive products  particularly large pharmaceutical companies 
many of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and human resources than we do  and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture  market and distribute products 
many of these companies operate large  well funded research  development and commercialization programs  have extensive experience in nonclinical and clinical studies  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals and manufacturing and marketing products  and have multiple products that have been approved or are in late stage development 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
furthermore  heightened awareness on the part of academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations of the potential commercial value of their inventions have led them to actively seek to commercialize the technologies they develop  which increases competition for investment in our programs 
in addition  there is increasing interest in developing drugs for rare diseases  which may have the effect of increasing the development of agents to treat sickle cell disease  ali and other indications we may pursue 
legislative action may generate further interest 
for instance  in july  the food and drug administration safety and innovation act was signed into law 
this act amended the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act in a variety of ways that encourage or facilitate the development of drugs for patients with rare diseases  including by expanding the priority review voucher system to rare pediatric diseases and encouraging the fda to implement more effective processes for expedited development and review of new medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for serious or life threatening diseases or conditions using a broad range of surrogate endpoints 
competitive products may be more effective  or more effectively marketed and sold  than ours  which would have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue 
with respect to competition for mst in sickle cell disease  we are aware of numerous companies with product candidates in varying stages of development 
some of our potential competitors in sickle cell disease are large  well financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or have partnered with such companies  which may give them development  regulatory and or marketing advantages over us 
for example  pfizer and novartis have each invested in privately held companies  glycomimetics  inc and selexys pharmaceuticals corporation  respectively  which have clinical stage agents for the treatment of vaso occlusive crisis 
in addition  numerous non profit or non commercial foundations and interest groups also are committed to improving outcomes for patients with sickle cell disease 
advances in the understanding of the signaling pathways associated with sickle cell disease may lead to further interest and development of treatment options 
if an effective treatment or cure for vaso occlusive crisis or sickle cell disease receives regulatory approval  the potential commercial success of mst could be severely jeopardized 
with respect to competition for mst for complications of arterial disease  although we intend first to develop mst as an adjunct to thrombolytics  it could compete with current revascularization methods  including thrombolytics 
in addition  we are aware of a number of potentially competitive investigational therapies for severe forms of thrombotic arterial disease  including angiogenic growth factors  vasoactive drugs  anticoagulants  thrombolytics  anti platelet agents  cytoprotectives  and blood substitutes  certain of which are in late stage clinical development 
should any of these other investigational therapies receive regulatory approval prior to mst  they may become entrenched in the standard of care  diminish the need for mst  or be difficult to displace 
with respect to resuscitation of shock following major trauma  mst could compete with various investigational therapies for hemorrhagic shock  including agents to improve blood flow in the microvasculature  improve oxygenation of ischemic tissues  and or prevent reperfusion injury 
some organizations with potentially competitive therapies have received funding from the federal government to progress their research and development 
to the extent other therapies demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy and receive regulatory approval prior to mst  the need for mst may be diminished 
in addition to investigational pharmacologic approaches  new resuscitation protocols are being explored to reduce morbidity and mortality following major hemorrhage and  to the extent they are successful  they may diminish the need for mst 
table of contents we are subject to uncertainty relating to healthcare reform measures and reimbursement policies that  if not favorable to our products  could hinder or prevent our products commercial success  if any of our product candidates are approved 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  private health insurers and other third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products 
the continuing efforts of the government  insurance companies  managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect our ability to set an appropriate price for our products  the rate and scope of adoption of our products by healthcare providers  our ability to generate revenue or achieve or maintain profitability  the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborators  and our access to additional capital 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities  private health insurers and other organizations establish what we believe are appropriate coverage and reimbursement for our products 
these payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement  particularly for new therapeutic products or if there is a perception that the target indication of the new product is well served by existing drugs or other treatments 
accordingly  even if coverage and reimbursement are provided  market acceptance of our products would be adversely affected if the level of coverage and or reimbursement for our products proved to be unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments 
there have been federal and state proposals to subject the pricing of healthcare goods and services to government control and to make other changes to the us healthcare system 
while we cannot predict the outcome of current or future legislation  we anticipate that the us congress and state legislatures will continue to introduce initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare 
in addition  in certain foreign markets  the pricing of drug products is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable or insufficient 
it is uncertain if future legislative proposals  whether domestic or abroad  will be adopted that might affect our products or product candidates or what actions federal  state  or private payors for healthcare treatment and services may take in response to any such healthcare reform proposals or legislation 
any such healthcare reforms could have a material and adverse effect on the marketability of any products for which we ultimately receive fda or other regulatory agency approval 
we face potential product liability exposure and  if successful claims are brought against us  we may incur substantial liability for a product or product candidate and may have to limit its commercialization 
in the future  we anticipate that we will need to obtain additional or increased product liability insurance coverage and it is uncertain whether such increased or additional insurance coverage can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our business in particular  the use of our product candidates in clinical studies and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval will expose us to product liability risks 
product liability claims might be brought against us by patients  healthcare providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against any such claims  we will incur substantial liabilities 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our products and loss of revenue  impairment of our business reputation  
table of contents withdrawal of clinical study participants  significant costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants  and the inability to commercialize our products and product candidates 
we maintain limited product liability insurance for our clinical studies  but our insurance coverage may not reimburse us or may not be sufficient to reimburse us for all expenses or losses we may suffer 
moreover  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and  in the future  we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses 
we expect that we would expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval of any of our product candidates  but we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially acceptable terms or may not be able to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against potential losses 
large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drug products that had unanticipated side effects 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to fall and  if judgments exceed our insurance coverage  could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business 
risks related to our common stock if we are unable to maintain compliance with nyse mkt continued listing standards  our common stock may be delisted from the nyse mkt equities market  which would likely cause the liquidity and market price of our common stock to decline 
our common stock currently is listed on the nyse mkt equities market 
the nyse mkt will consider suspending dealings in  or delisting  securities of an issuer that does not meet its continued listing standards  including specified stockholders equity levels 
in addition  the nyse mkt will consider suspending dealings in  or delisting  securities selling for a substantial period of time at a low price per share if the issuer fails to effect a reverse split of such stock within a reasonable time after being notified that the nyse mkt deems such action to be appropriate under the circumstances 
previously  prior to  we were not in compliance with certain nyse mkt stockholders equity continued listing standards 
specifically  we were not in compliance with section a ii of the nyse mkt company guide  or the company guide  because we reported stockholders equity of less than  and losses from continuing operations and net losses in three of our four most recent fiscal years  or section a iii of the company guide  because we reported stockholders equity of less than  and losses from continuing operations and net losses in our five most recent fiscal years 
in addition  we were notified  in accordance with section f v of the company guide  that the nyse mkt determined it was appropriate for us to effect a reverse stock split of our common stock to address our low selling price per share 
in april  we announced that we had resolved the stockholders equity continued listing deficiencies and we implemented a for reverse split of our common stock  in part to address the nyse mkt s requirement that we address our low stock price 
however  there is no assurance that we will continue to maintain compliance with such standards 
for example  we may determine to pursue development or other activities or grow our organization or product pipeline or at levels or on timelines that reduces our stockholders equity below the level required to maintain compliance with nyse mkt continued listing standards 
in addition  the market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile  as more fully described below under the risk titled the market price of our common stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile  and has traded at under per share for more than twelve consecutive months 
the nyse mkt may again determine that the selling price per share of our common stock is low and require that we effect a reverse stock split of our common stock  which would require stockholder approval that we may be unable to obtain 
our failure to maintain compliance with nyse mkt continued listing standards could result in the delisting of our common stock from the nyse mkt 

table of contents the delisting of our common stock from the nyse mkt likely would reduce the trading volume and liquidity in our common stock and may lead to decreases in the trading price of our common stock 
the delisting of our common stock may also materially impair our stockholders ability to buy and sell shares of our common stock 
in addition  the delisting of our common stock could significantly impair our ability to raise capital  which is critical to the execution of our current business strategy 
if our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock  a broker dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock in the secondary market 
if our common stock were removed from listing with the nyse mkt  it may be subject to the so called penny stock rules 
the sec has adopted regulations that define a penny stock to be any equity security that has a market price per share of less than  subject to certain exceptions  such as any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
for any transaction involving a penny stock  unless exempt  the rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers  subject to certain exceptions 
if our common stock were delisted and determined to be a penny stock  a broker dealer may find it more difficult to trade our common stock and an investor may find it more difficult to acquire or dispose of our common stock on the secondary market 
the market price of our common stock historically has been and likely will continue to be highly volatile 
the market price for our common stock historically has been highly volatile  and the market for our common stock has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  based both on our operating performance and for reasons that appear to us unrelated to our operating performance 
for instance  on august   the market price for our common stock dropped almost following our announcement of our receipt of the complete response letter for our exelbine nda  which stated that the fda could not approve it in its present form 
conversely  the market price for our common stock increased over in a day period in june and july and more than doubled over two trading days in late december the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors  including the level of our financial resources  announcements of entry into or consummation of a financing or strategic transaction  changes in the regulatory status of our product candidates  including results of any clinical studies and other research and development programs  fda or international regulatory actions and regulatory developments in the us and foreign countries  announcements of new products or technologies  commercial relationships or other events including clinical study results and regulatory events and actions by us or our competitors  market conditions in the pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical  specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors  developments concerning intellectual property rights generally or those of us or our competitors  changes in securities analysts estimates of our financial performance or deviations in our business and the trading price of our common stock from the estimates of securities analysts  
table of contents events affecting any future collaborations  commercial agreements and grants  fluctuations in stock market prices and trading volumes of similar companies  sales of large blocks of our common stock  including sales by our executive officers  directors and significant stockholders or pursuant to shelf or resale registration statements that register shares of our common stock that may be sold by us or certain of our current or future stockholders  discussion of us or our stock price by the financial and scientific press and in online investor communities  commencement of delisting proceedings by the nyse mkt  additions or departures of key personnel  and changes in third party payor reimbursement policies 
as evidenced by the august  decline  the realization of any of the foregoing could have a dramatic and adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced a substantial decline in market price 
moreover  regulatory entities often undertake investigations of investor transactions in securities that experience volatility following an announcement of a significant event or condition 
any such litigation brought against us or any such investigation involving our investors could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could hurt our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price could decline significantly based on results of clinical and nonclinical studies of mst and regulatory agency decisions affecting that development program 
we expect announcements of results of clinical and certain nonclinical studies of mst and regulatory decisions by us  the fda  or another regulatory agency to affect our stock price 
stock prices of companies in our industry have declined significantly when such results and decisions were unfavorable or perceived to be negative or discouraging or when a product candidate did not otherwise meet expectations 
if mst study results are not viewed favorably by us or third parties  including investors  analysts  potential collaborators  the academic and medical communities and regulators  our stock price could decline significantly and you could lose your investment in our common stock 
we may report top line study data from time to time  which is based on preliminary analysis of then available data 
such preliminary findings and conclusions are subject to change following a more comprehensive review of the study data 
in addition  results of clinical and nonclinical studies often are subject to different interpretations 
we may interpret or weigh the importance of study data differently than third parties  including those noted above 
others may not accept or agree with our analysis of study data  which could impact the approvability of mst and or the value of the mst program and our company in general 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or the perception that such sales may occur could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is performing well 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by  or the perceived possibility of sales by  us or our existing stockholders of shares of our common stock 
these sales by our existing stockholders might also make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
currently  we have effective primary registration statements on form s under which we may sell and issue more than million of securities 
we also have effective resale registration statements on form s that register a significant number of shares of our common stock and securities convertible into our common stock that may be sold by us or certain of our stockholders  including an effective resale registration statement for the shares of our common stock that have been and may be issued to the former synthrx stockholders 
collectively  these registration statements may increase the likelihood of sales by  or the perception of an increased likelihood of sales by  us or our existing stockholders of shares of our common stock 

table of contents we currently have voting control with respect to approximately of our outstanding common stock and we may obtain voting control over a significant additional amount of our outstanding common stock if we issue the milestone related shares to the former synthrx stockholders  and we may determine to cause those shares to be voted in such a manner that does not necessarily coincide with the interests of individual stockholders or particular groups of stockholders 
pursuant to the voting and transfer restriction agreement between us and each of the former principal stockholders of synthrx  each stockholder party has agreed to vote all shares of our common stock beneficially owned by that party with respect to every action or approval by written consent of our stockholders in such manner as directed by us  except in limited circumstances  and has executed an irrevocable proxy appointing and authorizing us to vote such shares in such manner 
if the development of mst achieves each of the milestones set forth in our merger agreement with synthrx  we will issue an additional  shares of our common stock  which  together with previously issued and outstanding shares held by these former synthrx stockholders  represent an aggregate approximately ownership stake in our company based on shares outstanding as of march  plus shares issued in connection with achievement of the milestones 
as a result of such potential issuances and the voting and transfer restriction agreement  in the future we may have significant control over substantially all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of certain mergers and other business combination transactions 
even if less than all potential milestone related shares are issued  our ability to control a potentially significant block of stockholder votes pursuant to the voting and transfer restriction agreement may enable us to substantially affect the outcome of proposals brought before our stockholders 
although our board of directors acts in a manner it believes is in the best interest of our stockholders as a whole  the interests of our stockholders as a whole may not always coincide with the interests of individual stockholders or particular groups of stockholders 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law may make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult  which could depress our stock price 
we are incorporated in delaware 
certain anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our charter documents as currently in effect may make a change in control of our company more difficult  even if a change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our bylaws limit who may call a special meeting of stockholders and establish advance notice requirements for nomination of individuals for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholders meetings 
delaware law also prohibits corporations from engaging in a business combination with any holders of or more of their capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors may use these provisions to prevent changes in the management and control of our company 
also  under applicable delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
in addition  provisions of certain compensatory contracts with our management  such as equity award agreements  may have an anti takeover effect by resulting in accelerated vesting of outstanding equity securities held by our executive officers 
in particular  in the event of a change in control  the vesting of options we granted since july to certain key executives will accelerate with respect to fifty percent of the then unvested shares on the day prior to the date of the change in control and  subject to the respective executive s continuous service  with respect to the remaining fifty percent of the then unvested shares on the one year anniversary of the date of the change in control  and could accelerate in full at the time of the change in control if the acquirer does not assume or substitute for the options 
as a result  if an acquirer desired to retain the services of one or both of those executives following an acquisition  it may be required to provide additional incentive to them  which could increase the cost of the acquisition to the acquirer and may deter or adversely affect the terms of the potential acquisition 
because we do not expect to pay dividends with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future  you must rely on stock appreciation for any return on your investment 
we have paid no cash dividends on any of our common stock to date  and we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to fund the development and growth of our business 
as a result  with respect to our common stock  we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  and payment of cash dividends  if any  will also depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
furthermore  we are subject to various laws and regulations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends and we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on  or prohibitions against  the payment of dividends 
due to our intent to retain any future earnings rather than pay cash dividends on our common stock and applicable laws  regulations and contractual obligations that may restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock  the success of your investment in our common stock will likely depend entirely upon any future appreciation and our common stock may not appreciate in value

the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices for our common stock in each full quarterly period within the two most recent fiscal years 
sales price high low high low first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter as of march   we had approximately record holders of our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those identified under item a risk factors in this report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for serious or life threatening diseases with significant unmet needs 
we are leveraging our molecular adhesion sealant technology  or mast  platform  derived from over two decades of clinical  nonclinical and manufacturing experience with purified and non purified poloxamers  to develop mst for diseases and conditions characterized by microcirculatory insufficiency endothelial dysfunction and or impaired blood flow 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development  or r d  and to acquisition of our product candidates 
we have not yet marketed or sold any products or generated any significant revenue and we have incurred significant losses since inception 
we incurred losses from operations of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of december  we believe the pharmacologic effects of mst support its development in more than one setting and we intend to develop mst in multiple clinical indications  both independently and through collaborations 
in january  we initiated epic evaluation of purified in children  a pivotal phase study of mst in sickle cell disease 
in february  we announced our plans to develop mst for complications of arterial disease  initially as an adjunct to thrombolytics in acute limb ischemia  and that in late or early we intend to initiate a phase  clinical proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mst in this indication 
additionally  we plan to conduct certain nonclinical studies to investigate the safety and or efficacy of mst in additional indications  including resuscitation of shock following major trauma and acute decompensated heart failure 
however  even if these nonclinical studies are positive  it is unlikely we will initiate clinical studies in these indications without a strategic collaboration or funding from the us government 
we may evaluate mst in other conditions in which its pharmacologic effects may translate into improved clinical outcomes 
due to our focus on mst  we elected to discontinue independent development of our anx docetaxel for injectable emulsion and exelbine vinorelbine injectable emulsion programs in and  respectively  and are evaluating other opportunities for further development of these agents  such as partnering and licensing arrangements 
we anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  we have based this estimate on significant assumptions and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
for example  we may pursue development activities for our product candidates at levels or on timelines  or we may incur unexpected expenses  that shorten the period through which our current financial resources will sustain us 
we expect to incur significant and increasing losses for the next several years as we advance mst through clinical studies and other development activities and seek regulatory approval to commercialize it 
we will need additional financing to support our planned operating activities 
in addition  we may seek to expand our product pipeline through acquisition of additional product candidates and or technologies 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity and or debt financings and through collaborations  including licensing arrangements  and other strategic transactions 
adequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or on a timely basis  or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy 

table of contents acquisition of synthrx merger consideration 
in april  we acquired synthrx  inc as a wholly owned subsidiary through a merger transaction in exchange for shares of our common stock and rights to additional shares of our common stock upon achievement of specified milestones related to mst we also assumed million of synthrx s transaction expenses 
upon completion of the acquisition  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the former synthrx stockholders   of which we repurchased in december for per share pursuant to the exercise of a repurchase right triggered as a result of the timing of and planned number of patients in the epic study 
we designated the repurchased shares as treasury stock 
we could issue up to an aggregate of  additional shares of our common stock to the former synthrx stockholders if and when the development of mst achieves certain milestones  with an aggregate of  shares issuable upon the dosing of the first patient in the epic study  which we refer to as the first milestone   shares issuable upon the fda s acceptance for review of a nda covering the use of purified poloxamer for the treatment of sickle cell crisis in children  which we refer to as the second milestone  and  shares issuable upon approval of such nda by the fda  which we refer to as the third milestone 
stockholders agreement 
in connection with our acquisition of synthrx  each of the former principal stockholders of synthrx entered into a stockholders voting and transfer restriction agreement with us 
this agreement became effective upon completion of the acquisition and will remain in effect until all of the shares of our common stock issued pursuant to the merger agreement to those stockholders and their affiliates have been transferred to non affiliates 
the transfer restriction aspect of the agreement  among other things  limits the amount of shares acquired pursuant to the merger agreement that the stockholder parties and their affiliates  as a group  can sell or transfer to non affiliates on any trading day to an aggregate number of shares of our common stock of up to of the average daily trading volume of our common stock 
the agreement provides  however  that once in any month period  the stockholder parties and their affiliates  as a group  may sell or transfer to non affiliates up to an aggregate number of such shares of our common stock as is equal to five times the average daily trading volume of our common stock 
in license agreement with cytrx corporation 
in connection with our acquisition of synthrx  through a prior license agreement between synthrx and cytrx corporation  we have rights to a variety of issued patents related to poloxamers and their uses 
the issued patents cover  among other things  poloxamer  purified poloxamer  methods of treating sickle cell anemia using poloxamer and methods of preparing purified poloxamer pursuant to this license agreement  we are required to make certain non refundable and non creditable milestone payments to cytrx based on the approval of each covered product in a major market  which includes the us the amount of each milestone is in the low single digit millions  half of which is due on the first commercial sale of the approved product and half of which is payable over time based on a percentage of quarterly net sales 
in addition  we would pay a single digit royalty on net sales of covered products 
however  in the event of a sublicense under the specified patents  in lieu of the foregoing milestone and royalty payments  we may elect  in our sole discretion  to pay cytrx an amount equal to of any sublicensing income we receive within days of receipt thereof 
sublicense income includes  without limitation  license fees  royalties  milestone payments  license maintenance fees and strategic alliance payments  whether in cash  equity or other property  with the payment to be in the same form as the payment we receive 

table of contents critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations included in this annual report is based upon consolidated financial statements that we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to determination of the fair value of contingent consideration  goodwill and acquired in process research and development  or ipr d  and recognition of expenses for clinical study accruals and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical information  when available  and assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions 
we believe the following accounting estimates are those that can have a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance and involve substantial subjectivity and judgment in the application of our accounting policies to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive discussion of all of our significant accounting policies 
see the notes accompanying our financial statements appearing in this report for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
accrued research and development expenses 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our accrued expenses 
this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders  communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost 
many of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met 
we make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time 
we periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments  if necessary 
the majority of our accrued expenses relate to r d services and related expenses 
examples of estimated accrued r d expenses include fees paid to contract manufacturing organizations  or cmos  in connection with process development activities and production of nonclinical and clinical trial material  fees paid to vendors in connection with nonclinical development activities  fees paid to consultants for regulatory related advisory services  fees paid to contract research organizations  or cros  in connection with clinical studies  and fees paid to investigative sites and investigators in connection with clinical studies 
we base our expenses related to cmos and cros on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to purchase orders or contracts with multiple service providers that we engage to manufacture our clinical trial material and conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf 
the financial terms of our arrangements with our cmos and cros are subject to negotiation  vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful completion of specified process development activities or the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical study milestones 
in accruing these service fees  we estimate  as applicable  the time period over which services will be performed eg  enrollment of patients  activation of clinical sites  etc if the actual timing varies from our estimate  we adjust the accrual accordingly 
in addition  there may be instances in which payments made to service providers will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of r d expense  which we report as an asset 
the actual costs and timing of clinical studies and research related manufacturing are uncertain and subject to change depending on a number of factors 
differences between actual costs of these services and the estimated costs that we have accrued in a prior period are recorded in the subsequent period in which the actual costs become known to us 
historically  these differences have not resulted in material adjustments  but such differences may occur in the future and have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 

table of contents business combinations 
we accounted for the acquisition of synthrx in accordance with accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  business combinations  which requires the purchase price to be measured at fair value 
the purchase price consisted entirely of shares of our common stock and included contingent consideration  which becomes vested or issuable  as applicable  upon achievement of the first milestone  the second milestone and the third milestone  as discussed above under acquisition of synthrx 
we calculated the total purchase price by determining the probability weighted fair value of the shares of our common stock issued  issued subject to repurchase and issuable to the former synthrx stockholders as of april   the acquisition date 
the probability and timing inputs related to the vesting and issuance events were based on estimates and assumptions regarding development of mst  which are highly judgmental due to the inherent unpredictability of drug development  particularly by development stage companies such as ours 
we recognized the estimated fair values as of the acquisition date of the tangible assets and intangible assets acquired  including ipr d  and liabilities assumed  and we recorded as goodwill the amount equal to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the accounting for the acquisition of synthrx required us to make significant estimates and assumptions  particularly with respect to the fair values of the contingent consideration and acquired ipr d 
we believe the fair values assigned to the contingent consideration and acquired ipr d were based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the available facts and circumstances as of the acquisition date 
however  these calculations were highly judgmental and it is possible that other professionals  applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances  could have developed and supported a range of alternative estimated amounts 
for instance  we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the fair value of contingent consideration  though other methodologies could have been used 
discounted cash flow models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including  but not limited to the probability of clinical and regulatory success for a product candidate considering its stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of a product candidate  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a product candidate  such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  estimated cash flows projected following the approval of a product candidate in development  the commercial life of the potential approved product and associated risks  and risk associated with uncertainty regarding achievement of the milestone events and  with respect to the first milestone  the circumstances under which it is achieved 
we estimated the time needed to complete the development and approval of mst based on assumptions regarding its stage of development as of the acquisition date and resources needed to complete its development and approval  taking into account the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing product candidates in general and mst in particular 
changes to any of these estimates and assumptions could significantly impact the fair values recorded for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of synthrx  resulting in significant charges to our operations 
in addition  unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
asset and liability for contingent consideration 
our contingent asset and contingent liability are related to our acquisition of synthrx and the amount of the purchase price  payable in shares of our common stock  subject to repurchase and issuance  respectively  based upon the achievement and circumstances of achievement of the first milestone 
we remeasure the fair value of this contingent consideration as of the end of each fiscal quarter until the arrangements are settled and as of the settlement date 
prior to the period ended december   our determination of the fair values of the contingent asset and contingent liability at each measurement date were based on significant assumptions regarding the timing and design of the epic study because up to approximately of the shares we previously issued to the former synthrx stockholders  or  shares  were subject to repurchase and the number of shares issuable upon achievement of the first milestone could be reduced by up to from  to  shares based the timing and design of that clinical study 
the fair values of the contingent asset and contingent liability are also based on the market price of our common stock 
as a proxy  we use the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nyse mkt equities market on the measurement date ie  the last trading day of each quarter or the settlement date  as applicable  which  given the volatility of our stock price  may vary considerably from one measurement date to the next 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable based on available facts and circumstances as of each measurement date 
changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration are recognized in earnings  as transaction related expenses  until the contingent consideration arrangement is settled 
the contingent asset was settled and eliminated in december upon our repurchase of  of the shares we previously issued to the former synthrx stockholders 
we exercised our repurchase right based on the timing of and planned number of patients in the epic study 
we remeasured the fair value of the contingent asset as of its settlement date and recognized the change in fair value as a transaction related expense 

table of contents goodwill and acquired ipr d 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  our goodwill and acquired ipr d are determined to have indefinite lives and  therefore  are not amortized 
instead  they are tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if we become aware of an event or a change in circumstances that would indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment testing on september of each year 
pursuant to accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  and no 
 intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads us to determine that it is more likely than not that is  a likelihood of more than that our goodwill or our acquired ipr d is impaired 
if we choose to first assess qualitative factors and we determine that it is not more likely than not goodwill or acquired ipr d is impaired  we are not required to take further action to test for impairment 
we also have the option to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform only the quantitative impairment test  which we may choose to do in some periods but not in others 
our determinations as to whether  and  if so  the extent to which  goodwill and acquired ipr d become impaired are highly judgmental and based on significant assumptions regarding our projected future financial condition and operating results  changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets  development of mst or our overall business strategy  and regulatory  market and economic environment and trends 
property and equipment  net 
property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which is generally three to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the economic life of the asset or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with asc topic  property  plant and equipment overall  we test for recoverability of long lived assets  including property and equipment  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount for the assets may not be recoverable 
if our assessment indicates impairment  we measure the impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the assets 
fair value determinations are based on an undiscounted cash flow model  or independent appraisals  as appropriate 
share based compensation expenses 
we account for share based compensation awards granted to employees  including non employee members of our board of directors  in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation 
compensation expense for all share based awards is based on the estimated fair value of the award on its date of grant and recognized on a straight line basis over its vesting period 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise our estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on historical experience 
although share based compensation expense can be significant to our consolidated financial statements  it is not related to the payment of any cash by us 
we estimate the grant date fair value of a stock option award using the black scholes option pricing model  or black scholes model 
in determining the grant date fair value of a stock option award under the black scholes model  we must make a number of assumptions  including the term of the award  the volatility of the price of our common stock over the term of the award  the risk free interest rate and estimated forfeiture rate 
changes in these or other assumptions could have a material impact on the compensation expense we recognize 
results of operations overview we operate our business and evaluate our company on the basis of a single reportable segment  which is the business of developing therapies for serious or life threatening diseases 
revenue we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales until such time  if any  that we have obtained approval from a regulatory agency to sell one or more of our product candidates  which we cannot predict with certainty will occur 

table of contents operating expenses research and development expenses 
we maintain and evaluate our r d expenses by the type of cost incurred rather than by project 
we maintain and evaluate r d expenses by type primarily because we outsource a substantial portion of our work and our r d personnel and consultants work across multiple programs rather than dedicating their time to one particular program 
we began maintaining such expenses by type on january  we categorize our r d expenses as external clinical study fees and expenses  external nonclinical study fees and expenses  personnel costs and share based compensation expense 
the major components of our external clinical study fees and expenses are fees and expenses related to cros and clinical study investigative sites and investigators 
the major components of our external nonclinical study fees and expenses are fees and expenses related to preclinical studies and other nonclinical testing  research related manufacturing  and quality assurance and regulatory affairs services 
research related manufacturing expenses include costs associated with purchasing active pharmaceutical ingredient api  conducting process development activities  producing clinical trial material  producing material for stability testing to support regulatory filings  related labeling  testing and release  packaging and storing services and related consulting fees 
impairment losses on r d related manufacturing equipment are also considered research related manufacturing expenses 
personnel costs relate to employee salaries  benefits and related costs 
a general understanding of drug development is critical to understanding our results of operations and  particularly  our r d expenses 
drug development in the us and most countries throughout the world is a process that includes several steps defined by the fda and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries 
the fda approval processes relating to new drug products differ depending on the nature of the particular product candidate for which approval is sought 
with respect to any product candidate with active ingredients not previously approved by the fda  a prospective drug product manufacturer is required to submit an nda that includes complete reports of pre clinical  clinical and laboratory studies and extensive manufacturing information to demonstrate the product candidate s safety and effectiveness 
generally  an nda must be supported by at least phase  and clinical studies  with each study typically more expensive and lengthy than the previous study 
future expenditures on r d programs are subject to many uncertainties  and development timelines and costs can differ materially from expectations 
at this time  given the inherent difficulties and uncertainties associated with clinical development and obtaining fda approvals  we cannot estimate with any reasonable certainty the duration of or costs to complete development of mst in sickle cell disease or any other indication 
while we currently are focused on advancing mst  our future r d expenses will depend on the number and scope of development programs we pursue and whether  and to what degree  our product candidates are developed by us independently or with a future partner 
the duration and costs of our r d programs may vary significantly over the life of a program and among programs as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of clinical and nonclinical studies necessary to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product candidate in a particular indication  the number of patients who participate in each clinical study  the number and location of sites included and the rate of site approval in each clinical study  the rate of patient enrollment and ratio of randomized to evaluable patients in each clinical study  the duration of patient treatment and follow up  the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies  the time and cost to manufacture clinical trial material and commercial product  including process development and scale up activities  and to conduct stability studies  which can last several years  the availability and cost of comparative agents used in clinical studies  the timing and terms of any collaborative or other strategic arrangements that we may establish  and the cost  requirements  timing of and the ability to secure regulatory agency approvals  
table of contents we regularly evaluate the prospects of our r d programs  including in response to available scientific  nonclinical and clinical data  our assessments of a product candidate s market potential and our available resources  and make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each one 
we expect our r d expenses to increase as we continue epic  our phase clinical study of mst  and initiate and conduct additional studies of mst in sickle cell disease and other indications  as well as perform additional manufacturing process development activities and manufacture additional clinical trial material 
as a result  we expect our r d expenses to increase significantly in relative to while many of our r d expenses are transacted in us dollars  certain expenses are required to be paid in foreign currencies and expose us to transaction gains and losses that could result from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in particular  we may be obligated to pay in foreign currencies for the services of third party manufacturers of and component suppliers for our product candidates 
our exposure to currency risk may increase in connection with the manufacture of product for commercial sale  if and as we obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to market our product candidates 
we include realized gains and losses from foreign currency transactions in operations as incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and related costs for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  legal and market research functions  professional and consulting fees for accounting  legal  investor relations  business development  market research  human resources and information technology services 
other sg a expenses include facility lease and insurance costs 
we expect sg a expenses in to remain consistent relative to transaction related expenses 
transaction related expenses consist of legal  accounting  financial and business development advisory fees associated with the evaluation of potential acquisition targets and execution of acquisition transactions  including our acquisition of synthrx 
transaction related expenses also include any changes in the fair value of the contingent asset and contingent liability related to our acquisition of synthrx  which we remeasure as of the end of each quarter 
interest and other income expense 
interest and other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  gains and losses from foreign currency transactions and other non operating gains and losses

table of contents r d expenses 
in  our most significant r d expenses were third party fees and expenses that related primarily to generating mst clinical trial material and preparing for the epic study 
these expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with research related manufacturing  clinical study related consulting and study set up services  and regulatory affairs and quality assurance related consulting services 
in  our most significant r d expenses were third party fees and expenses that related primarily to the exelbine and anx programs 
these expenses consisted primarily of costs associated with research related manufacturing and regulatory affairs and quality assurance related consulting services 
the following table summarizes our consolidated r d expenses by type for each of the periods listed and their respective percent of our total r d expenses for and years ended december  january  through december  external clinical study fees and expenses external nonclinical study fees and expenses personnel costs share based compensation expense total r d expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in r d expenses in compared to was due to a million increase in personnel costs  a million increase in external clinical study fees and expenses  and a million increase in external nonclinical study fees and expenses 
the increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from additional clinical and research related manufacturing staff hired in  including relocation and recruitment costs for our new chief medical officer 
the increase in external clinical study fees and expenses was related primarily to a million increase in clinical consulting and phase study planning expenses for mst  offset by a million decrease in clinical consulting expenses for anx and exelbine 
the increase in external nonclinical study fees and expenses was related primarily to a million increase in research related manufacturing activities and regulatory affairs related consulting expenses for mst and a million increase in research related manufacturing activities for anx  offset by a million decrease in commercial readiness manufacturing activities for exelbine 
the increase in research related manufacturing expenses for anx resulted from recognition of an impairment loss of million on equipment used to manufacture clinical trial material and million of other expenses related to the discontinuation of anx manufacturing activities

sg a expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a million increase in personnel costs  mainly due to additional staff hired in  and a million increase in share based compensation expense  offset by a million decrease in consulting fees and legal expenses 
the decrease in consulting fees and legal expenses was due primarily to cost savings realized by discontinuation of activities related to exelbine and anx transaction related expenses 
transaction related expenses were negative  million  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  we recognized transaction related expenses for the year ended december  due to changes in the fair values of our contingent asset and contingent liability at december  and december   respectively  compared to december  the contingent asset and contingent liability both relate to contingent consideration for the synthrx acquisition 
the contingent asset was settled on december  by our repurchase of  shares of our common stock from the former synthrx stockholders  and we remeasured its fair value as of that date 
the contingent liability was not settled before the end of the year and  consequently  we remeasured its fair value as of december  the changes in the fair values of the contingent asset and contingent liability were due to updated estimates regarding the probability and circumstances of achievement of the first milestone and the differences in our stock price at december  per share and december  per share relative to december  per share  which was the last trading day of for additional discussion of the contingent asset and contingent liability  see contingent asset and contingent liability below 

table of contents transaction related expenses for the year ended december  consisted of million related to legal  accounting  financial and business development advisory fees associated with the evaluation of potential acquisition targets  including synthrx  and the execution of our acquisition of synthrx  offset by a net million reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration that resulted from changes in the fair values of the contingent asset and contingent liability at december  relative to april   the acquisition date 
those changes in fair value were due to our significantly lower stock price at december  per share relative to april  per share and updated estimates regarding the probability and circumstances of achievement of the first milestone 
interest and other income expense 
interest income amounted to  for  compared to  for the increase in interest income of  for was attributable primarily to higher interest rates on invested balances in as compared to other expense was  in  compared to other income of  in the other income in was primarily attributable to insurance proceeds 
net loss 
net loss was million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share basic and diluted  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have a history of annual losses from operations and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for at least the next several years 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred losses from operations of million and million  respectively 
our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  we historically have funded our operations principally through proceeds from sales of our equity securities 
we did not conduct any capital raising transaction in in  we raised an aggregate of million in net proceeds through the following equity financings in january  we completed a registered direct equity financing involving the issuance of units consisting of  shares of our common stock  year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the gross proceeds of this financing were million  and we received million in net proceeds after deducting the fees and expenses of our placement agent and our other offering expenses 
the year warrants expired unexercised in january we may receive up to million of additional proceeds from the exercise of the year warrants 
the exercise price of the warrants is per share  and  subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations  the year warrants are exercisable any time on or before january  in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of our common stock and warrants exercisable for up to  additional shares of our common stock 
these securities were offered and sold to the public in multiples of a fixed combination consisting of one share and a warrant to purchase up to of a share of our common stock 
the gross proceeds from this financing were million  and we received million in net proceeds after deducting the underwriting commissions and our other offering expenses 
we may receive up to million of additional proceeds from the exercise of the warrants issued to investors in this financing 
the exercise price of the warrants is per share  and  subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations  the year warrants are exercisable any time on or before november  
table of contents in addition to potential proceeds from exercise of the warrants described above  we may receive up to million and million from the exercise of warrants issued in the registered direct equity financings we completed in october and may  respectively  however  the exercise of these warrants is subject to certain beneficial ownership limitations 
in addition  the exercise prices of these warrants are and  respectively  and  in comparison  the closing sale price of our common stock on december  was per share and we do not expect the holders of any of our warrants to exercise them unless and until our common stock trades at or above the exercise price of their warrants

net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase in cash used in operating activities in was due primarily to a higher net loss in as compared to million  which was attributable primarily to increases in our r d expenses in connection with mst development activities  and an increase in prepaids and other assets million  offset by a decrease in the gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to our synthrx acquisition million  increased share based compensation expense million  and a write off of manufacturing equipment related to the discontinuation of anx manufacturing activities million 
the gain on the change in fair value of contingent consideration was greater in compared to primarily due to a significantly greater stock price difference on the fair value measurement dates compared to fair value measurement dates

investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in the difference was due primarily to an increase of million in purchases of certificates of deposit  offset by million in maturities and sales of certificates of deposits 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was in  compared to million in the cash provided by financing activities in consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our equity securities in the financing transactions we completed during that year 

table of contents management outlook we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
however  our estimate of the period of time through which our current financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement based on significant assumptions that involve a number of risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially 
factors that will affect our future funding requirements include  but are not limited to the progress of our clinical and nonclinical studies of mst  particularly the epic study  the number and nature of indications and jurisdictions in which we pursue development and regulatory approval of mst  and the extent to which we do so independently or through collaborations or other strategic transactions  the rate of progress and costs of development and regulatory approval activities associated with mst  including expenses related to initiating and conducting clinical studies and research related manufacturing expenses  the extent to which we increase our workforce  the extent to which we seek to commercialize and sell mst  if approved  independently or through collaborations or other strategic transactions  the extent of commercial success of any of our product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval  the costs and timing of establishing commercial manufacturing supply arrangements for our product candidates and establishing or acquiring sales and distribution capabilities for any approved products  and the extent to which we seek to expand our product pipeline and execute on transactions intended to do so 
we are focusing our resources almost exclusively on the development of mst we initiated the epic study in january and our top priority is enrolling subjects in that study 
although predicting the rate of enrollment for epic is subject to a number of assumptions and the actual rate may differ materially  we expect to complete enrollment in we currently estimate that external clinical study fees and expenses for epic will be in the range of approximately million to million 
in january  we also initiated a thorough qt qtc study  or tqt study  of mst to evaluate its effect on cardiac ventricular repolarization  specifically the qt interval in healthy volunteers 
we expect to announce results mid year we estimate that external clinical study fees and expenses for the tqt study will be approximately million 
in addition  in  we plan to initiate a sub study within epic to evaluate the effect of mst on microvascular blood flow mbf and tissue oxygen saturation sto this sub study will be conducted at select epic sites using non invasive devices to measure mbf and sto and we plan to enroll approximately patients 
we also plan to conduct a number of nonclinical studies of mst to further assess its efficacy  safety and tolerability in sickle cell disease and other indications  including six month toxicology studies that we expect to begin in in february  we announced our plans to develop mst for complications of arterial disease  initially as an adjunct to thrombolytics in acute limb ischemia 
we plan to solicit fda input on our planned phase  clinical proof of concept study in ali in the third quarter of and  depending in part upon fda input  we expect to initiate the study in late or early we anticipate that the study will enroll approximately patients and that enrollment will be completed in approximately to months 
we estimate that external clinical study fees and expenses for this phase study will be approximately million 
we intend to evaluate mst in other conditions in which its demonstrated pharmacologic effects may translate into improved clinical outcomes  which would increase our capital requirements in future periods 
however  unless we secure us government or other third party funding for development of mst in a particular indication  other than as described above  we do not plan to initiate additional clinical studies in although our current focus is on the development of mst  from time to time  we may evaluate pipeline expansion opportunities that we believe will increase the long term value of our company 
the process of identifying and evaluating various opportunities can be lengthy and complex and divert management s attention from our current development programs 
we have limited resources to identify  evaluate and negotiate potential transactions  and supplementing our current resources to complete one or more transactions may be costly 
we expect that our capital requirements would increase in future periods if we were to expand our product pipeline 
although we anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  we do not anticipate that such capital alone will be sufficient to fund our operations through the successful development and commercialization of mst we will need additional financing to support our operating activities 
in addition  we may seek to expand our product pipeline through acquisition of additional product candidates and or technologies 
for the foreseeable future  we plan to seek to fund our operations through public or private equity and or debt financings and through collaborations  including licensing arrangements  and other strategic transactions 
even though we were able to raise significant funds in the recent past through equity financings  adequate additional financing may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms  on a timely basis or at all 
our failure to raise capital as and when needed would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and ability to pursue our business strategy 

table of contents contingent asset and contingent liability our contingent asset was settled on december  prior to that date  our contingent asset was the probability weighted fair value of the shares of our common stock issued to the former synthrx stockholders on the acquisition date april  that we anticipated would be repurchased by us under the terms of the merger agreement based on our estimates of the probability of achievement of the first milestone and assumptions regarding the circumstances under which the first milestone would be achieved 
the number of outstanding shares subject to this repurchase right was  shares 
on december   based on the timing of and the planned number of subjects in the epic study  we exercised our repurchase right in full and purchased all  shares for per share  which eliminated  or settled  the contingent asset as of that date 
prior to that settlement date  we remeasured the fair value of the contingent asset as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
the fair value of the contingent asset was greater at its settlement date relative to december  due primarily to the increase in our stock price at december  per share relative to december  per share  which was the last trading day of  and updated estimates regarding the probability and circumstances of achievement of the first milestone 
our contingent liability is the probability weighted fair value of the shares of our common stock issuable to the former synthrx stockholders upon achievement of the first milestone 
the number of shares issuable ranged from  to  shares 
however  as of december   based on the timing of and planned number of patients in the epic study  the number of shares issuable is  shares 
we remeasure the fair value of the contingent liability as of the last day of each fiscal quarter 
the fair value of the contingent liability was greater at december  relative to december  despite the slight decrease in our stock price at december  per share relative to december  per share due to increased certainty that first milestone would be achieved and updated estimates regarding the circumstances of its achievement 
as of december   our contingent liability represented of our total liabilities 
acquired in process research and development our acquired ipr d is the estimated fair value of synthrx s lead product candidate  mst  as of april   the acquisition date 
we determined that the estimated fair value of the mst program was million as of the acquisition date using the multi period excess earnings method  or mpeem  which is a form of the income approach 
under the mpeem  the fair value of an intangible asset is equal to the present value of the asset s incremental after tax cash flows excess earnings remaining after deducting the market rates of return on the estimated value of contributory assets contributory charge over its remaining useful life 
to calculate fair value of the mst program under the mpeem  we used probability weighted cash flows discounted at a rate considered appropriate given the significant inherent risks associated with drug development by development stage companies 
cash flows were calculated based on estimated projections of revenues and expenses related to the program and then reduced by a contributory charge on requisite assets employed 
contributory assets included debt free working capital  net fixed assets and assembled workforce 
rates of return on the contributory assets were based on rates used for comparable market participants 
cash flows were assumed to extend through the market exclusivity period estimated to be provided by orphan drug designation 
the resultant cash flows were then discounted to present value using a weighted average cost of equity capital for companies with profiles substantially similar to that of synthrx  which we believe represents the rate that market participants would use to value the assets 
we compensated for the phase of development of this program by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows 
the projected cash flows were based on significant assumptions  such as the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of mst  estimates of revenue and operating profit related to the program considering its stage of development  the life of the potential commercialized product and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in drug development  such as obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 

table of contents our deferred income tax liability of million as of december  reflects the tax impact of the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the ipr d acquired in connection with our acquisition of synthrx 
such deferred tax liability cannot be used to offset deferred tax assets when analyzing our end of year valuation allowance as the acquired ipr d is considered to have an indefinite life until we complete or abandon development of mst tax loss carry forwards as of december   we had federal and california net operating loss carry forwards of million and million  respectively 
these tax loss carry forwards begin to expire in as of december   we also had federal and california r d tax credit carry forwards of  and  respectively 
the federal tax credit carry forwards begin to expire in the california tax credit carry forwards do not expire 
sections and of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or irc  limit our ability to use net operating loss carry forwards and r d tax credit carry forwards  or  together  tax attribute carry forwards  to offset future taxable income if we experience a cumulative change in ownership of more than within a three year testing period 
during the first quarter of  we completed a formal study and determined ownership changes within the meaning of irc section had occurred during and  with the most recent as a result of our november common stock and warrant financing 
as a result of these ownership changes  upon application of limitations prescribed by irc section  we may be ineligible to utilize any of the tax attribute carry forwards we had accumulated as of november  to offset future taxable income  and we adjusted our tax attribute carry forwards accordingly by million 
the stated amounts of our tax attribute carry forwards as of december  reflect only those tax attribute carry forwards we accumulated following november  through further analysis in the future we may determine that a small amount of the tax attribute carry forwards we had accumulated through november  can be utilized 
because the tax attribute carry forwards accumulated through november  were fully offset by a valuation allowance  a corresponding reduction in the company s valuation allowance has also been recorded  resulting in no income tax impact
