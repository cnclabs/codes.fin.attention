item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following our ability to continue to access the credit markets to satisfy our liquidity requirements  regulatory trends and decisions  including the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  the impact of adverse economic conditions on our customers  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and price of natural gas  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities  including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in texas  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  adverse weather conditions  the capital intensive nature of our gas distribution business  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits and increased funding requirements along with increased costs of health care benefits  possible increased federal  state and local regulation of the safety of our operations  increased federal regulatory oversight and potential penalties  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the impact of possible future additional regulatory and financial risks associated with global warming and climate change on our business  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our gas distribution business  the threat of cyber attacks or acts of cyber terrorism that could disrupt our business operations and information technology systems  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from estimates 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require 
table of contents management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
accordingly  these critical accounting policies are reviewed periodically by the audit committee of the board of directors 
critical accounting policy summary of policy factors influencing application of the policy regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations meet the criteria of a cost based  rate regulated entity under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  the financial results for these operations reflect the effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions to which we are subject 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because it is probable they can be recovered through rates 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
discontinuing the application of this method of accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
decisions of regulatory authorities issuance of new regulations assessing the probability of the recoverability of deferred costs unbilled revenue we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues attributable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities  which are subject to refund 
we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
estimates of delivered sales volumes based on actual tariff information and weather information and estimates of customer consumption and or behavior estimates of purchased gas costs related to estimated deliveries estimates of uncollectible amounts billed subject to refund 
table of contents critical accounting policy summary of policy factors influencing application of the policy pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis using a september measurement date and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement benefit plan costs 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on bonds available in the marketplace that are suitable for settling the obligations  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with currently available high quality corporate bonds 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan costs 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan costs are not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan costs over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
the market related value of our plan assets represents the fair market value of the plan assets  adjusted to smooth out short term market fluctuations over a five year period 
the use of this methodology will delay the impact of current market fluctuations on the pension expense for the period 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
general economic and market conditions assumed investment returns by asset class assumed future salary increases projected timing of future cash disbursements health care cost experience trends participant demographic information actuarial mortality assumptions impact of legislation contingencies in the normal course of business  we are confronted with issues or events that may result in a contingent liability 
these generally relate to uncollectible receivables  lawsuits  claims made by third parties or the action of various regulatory agencies 
we recognize these contingencies in our consolidated financial statements when we determine  based on currently available facts and circumstances it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset will not be recovered  and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
actual results may differ from estimates  depending on actual outcomes or changes in the facts or expectations surrounding each potential exposure 
changes in the estimates related to contingencies could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
our contingencies are further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
currently available facts management s estimate of future resolution 
table of contents critical accounting policy summary of policy factors influencing application of the policy financial instruments and hedging activities we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
the objectives for using financial instruments have been tailored to meet the needs of our regulated and nonregulated businesses 
these objectives are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we record all of our financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value as required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with changes in fair value ultimately recorded in the income statement 
the recognition of the changes in fair value of these financial instruments recorded in the income statement is contingent upon whether the financial instrument has been designated and qualifies as a part of a hedging relationship or if regulatory rulings require a different accounting treatment 
our accounting elections for financial instruments and hedging activities utilized are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the criteria used to determine if a financial instrument meets the definition of a derivative and qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex and require management to exercise professional judgment 
further  as more fully discussed below  significant changes in the fair value of these financial instruments could materially impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
finally  changes in the effectiveness of the hedge relationship could impact the accounting treatment 
designation of contracts under the hedge accounting rules judgment in the application of accounting guidance assessment of the probability that future hedged transactions will occur changes in market conditions and the related impact on the fair value of the hedged item and the associated designated financial instrument changes in the effectiveness of the hedge relationship fair value measurements we report certain assets and liabilities at fair value  which is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the fair value of our financial instruments is subject to potentially significant volatility based on numerous considerations including  but not limited to changes in commodity prices  interest rates  maturity and settlement of these financial instruments 
prices actively quoted on national exchanges are used to determine the fair value of most of our assets and liabilities recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
within our nonregulated operations  we utilize a mid market pricing convention the mid point between the bid and ask prices for determining fair value measurement  as permitted under current accounting standards 
values derived from these sources reflect the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed 
we utilize models and other valuation methods to determine fair value when external sources are not available 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these financial instruments represent the best information available with respect to the market in which transactions involving these financial instruments are executed  the closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
fair value estimates also consider our own creditworthiness and the creditworthiness of the counterparties involved 
our counterparties consist primarily of financial institutions and major energy companies 
this concentration of counterparties may materially impact our exposure to credit risk resulting from market  economic or regulatory conditions 
we seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through an evaluation of their financial condition and credit ratings and the use of collateral requirements under certain circumstances 
general economic and market conditions volatility in underlying market conditions maturity dates of financial instruments creditworthiness of our counterparties creditworthiness of atmos energy impact of credit risk mitigation activities on the assessment of the creditworthiness of atmos energy and its counterparties 
table of contents critical accounting policy summary of policy factors influencing application of the policy impairment assessments we review the carrying value of our long lived assets  including goodwill and identifiable intangibles  whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that such carrying values may not be recoverable  and at least annually for goodwill  as required by us accounting standards 
the evaluation of our goodwill balances and other long lived assets or identifiable assets for which uncertainty exists regarding the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets involves the assessment of future cash flows and external market conditions and other subjective factors that could impact the estimation of future cash flows including  but not limited to the commodity prices  the amount and timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances or market conditions could adversely affect these estimates  which could result in an impairment charge 
general economic and market conditions projected timing and amount of future discounted cash flows judgment in the evaluation of relevant data results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
historically  this has generally resulted in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each fiscal year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each fiscal year 
as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
however  we believe rate design changes implemented during the first quarter of fiscal in our mid tex and west texas divisions should continue to cause this pattern to change 
the rate design approved in these regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the customer base charge and a decrease in the consumption charge applied to customer usage 
the effect of this change in rate design should result in a more equal distribution of operating income earned over the fiscal year for approximately percent of our natural gas distribution segment 
additionally  the seasonality of our business impacts our working capital differently at various times during the year 
typically  our accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term debt balances peak by the end of january and then start to decline  as customers begin to pay their winter heating bills 
gas stored underground  particularly in our natural gas distribution segment  typically peaks in november and declines as we utilize storage gas to serve our customers 
during fiscal  we earned million  or per diluted share  which represents a twelve percent increase in net income and diluted net income per share over fiscal  primarily due to recent improvements in rate designs in our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage segments combined with a two percent year over year increase in consolidated natural gas distribution throughput due to colder weather 
we completed the sale of our georgia natural gas distribution operations on april  to liberty energy georgia corp  an affiliate of algonquin power utilities corp 
for a cash price of approximately million pursuant to a purchase agreement executed on august  in connection with the sale  we recognized a net of tax gain of million 
accordingly  the results of operations for this service area are shown in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
prior year results also reflect our illinois  iowa and missouri service areas in discontinued operations 
the sale of these three service areas was completed in august we also took several steps during the year ended september  to further strengthen our balance sheet and borrowing capability 
in december  we amended our million revolving credit agreement primarily to i increase our borrowing capacity to million while retaining the accordion feature that would allow an increase in borrowing capacity up to billion and ii to permit same day funding on base rate loans 
in august  we amended our revolving credit agreement primarily to increase the term through august we also terminated atmos energy marketing s million committed and secured credit facility and replaced this facility with two million day bilateral facilities  which should result in a decrease in external credit expense incurred in our nonregulated operations 
after giving effect to these changes  we have over billion of working capital funding from four committed revolving credit facilities and one noncommitted revolving credit facility 

table of contents on january   we issued million of year unsecured senior notes  which replaced  on a long term basis  our million year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in august the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay million outstanding under the short term financing facility used to redeem our senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes

income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share compared with million  or per diluted share in the prior year period 
income from discontinued operations was million or per diluted share for the year  which includes the gain on sale of substantially all our assets in georgia of million  compared with million or per diluted share in the prior year 
unrealized gains in our nonregulated operations during the current year increased net income by million or per diluted share compared with net losses recorded in the prior year of million  or per diluted share 
additionally  net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items 
in fiscal  net income included the net positive impact of several one time items totaling million  or per diluted share related to the pre tax items  which are discussed in further detail below 
in fiscal  net income includes an million million  net of tax  or per diluted share  favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the april  completion of the sale of our georgia assets

additionally  net income in both periods was impacted by nonrecurring items 
in fiscal  net income included the net positive impact of several one time items totaling million  or per diluted share related to pre tax items 
in fiscal  net income included the net positive impact of several one time items totaling million  or per diluted share related to the following amounts million positive impact of a deferred tax rate adjustment 
million million  net of tax unfavorable impact related to a one time donation to a donor advised fund 
million million  net of tax favorable impact related to the gain recorded in association with the august  completion of the sale of our iowa  illinois and missouri assets 
million million  net of tax unfavorable impact related to the noncash impairment of certain assets in our nonregulated business 
see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 
natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that 
table of contents we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy  progress towards implementing that strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
we are generally able to pass the cost of gas through to our customers without markup under purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms  therefore the cost of gas typically does not have an impact on our gross profit as increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipt taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenue is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
although the cost of gas typically does not have a direct impact on our gross profit  higher gas costs may adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
in addition  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or  in the case of industrial consumers  to use alternative energy sources 
however  gas cost risk has been mitigated in recent years through improvements in rate design that allow us to collect from our customers the gas cost portion of our bad debt expense on approximately percent of our residential and commercial margins 
we completed the sale of our georgia natural gas distribution operations on april  to liberty energy georgia corp  an affiliate of algonquin power utilities corp 
for a cash price of approximately million 
in connection with the sale  we recognized a net of tax gain of million 
on august   we completed the sale of substantially all of our natural gas distribution operations in missouri  illinois and iowa 
during fiscal  we completed regulatory proceedings  which should result in a million increase in annual operating income 
the majority of this rate increase related to our mid tex division  where rates became effective january  the rate design approved in our mid tex division and west texas division regulatory proceedings includes an increase to the base customer charge and a decrease in the commodity charge applied to customer consumption 
the effect of this change in rate design allows the company s rates to be more closely aligned with the utility industry standard rate design 
in addition  we anticipate these divisions will earn their operating income more ratably over the fiscal year as they are now less dependent on customer consumption

million increase in rates in our kentucky mid states  mississippi  colorado kansas and louisiana divisions 
million increase due to colder weather  primarily in the mississippi  kentucky mid states and colorado kansas divisions 
million increase in revenue related taxes in our mid tex and west texas service areas primarily due to higher revenues on which the tax is calculated 
million increase in transportation revenues 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income  increased by million  primarily due to the following million increase in employee related expenses due to lower labor capitalization rates  increased benefit costs and increased variable compensation expense 

table of contents million increase primarily associated with higher line locate activities  pipeline and right of way maintenance spending to improve the safety and reliability of our system 
million increase in taxes  other than income due to higher revenue related taxes  as discussed above 
million increase in bad debt expense primarily attributable to an increase in revenue arising from the rate design changes and the temporary suspension of active customer collection activities following the implementation of a new customer information system during the third fiscal quarter 
these increases were partially offset by million decrease in legal and other administrative costs 
million decrease in depreciation expense due to new depreciation rates approved in the most recent mid tex rate case that went into effect in january million gain realized on the sale of certain investments 
miscellaneous income increased million  primarily due to the absence of a million one time donation to a donor advised fund in the prior year  the completion of a periodic review of our performance based ratemaking pbr mechanism in our tennessee service area and the implementation of a new pbr program in our mississippi division during fiscal interest charges decreased million  primarily from interest deferrals associated with our infrastructure spending activities in texas 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit was primarily due to a million net increase in rate adjustments  primarily in the mid tex  louisiana  mississippi  west texas and kentucky service areas 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease in revenue related taxes in our mid tex  west texas and mississippi service areas  primarily due to lower revenues on which the tax is calculated 
million decrease due to an eight percent decrease in consolidated throughput caused principally by lower residential and commercial consumption combined with warmer weather in the current year compared to fiscal in most of our service areas 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes  other than income increased million primarily due to the following million increase in legal costs  primarily due to settlements 
million increase in employee related costs 
million increase in depreciation and amortization associated with an increase in our net plant as a result of our capital investments in fiscal million increase in software maintenance costs 
these increases were partially offset by the following million decrease in operating expenses due to increased capital spending and warmer weather allowing us time to complete more capital work than in the prior year 
million decrease due to the establishment of regulatory assets for pension and postretirement costs 
miscellaneous income decreased million primarily due to the absence of a million pre tax gain recognized in fiscal as a result of unwinding two treasury locks million  net of tax and a million one time donation to a donor advised fund in fiscal interest charges decreased million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prepayment of our million senior notes in the fourth quarter of fiscal  refinancing long term debt at reduced interest rates and reducing commitment fees from decreasing the number of credit facilities and extending the length of their terms in fiscal additionally  results for fiscal were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of million 
due to the completion of the sale of our missouri  iowa and illinois service areas in the fiscal fourth quarter  the company updated its analysis of the tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in the future to reflect the sale of these service areas 
the updated 
table of contents analysis supported a reduction in the deferred tax rate which when applied to the balance of taxable income deferred to future periods resulted in a reduction of the company s overall deferred tax liability 
the following table shows our operating income from continuing operations by natural gas distribution division  in order of total rate base  for the fiscal years ended september   and the presentation of our natural gas distribution operating income is included for financial reporting purposes and may not be appropriate for ratemaking purposes

in thousands mid tex kentucky mid states louisiana west texas mississippi colorado kansas other total regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of excess gas 
our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our mid tex service area 
natural gas prices do not directly impact the results of this segment as revenues are derived from the transportation of natural gas 
however  natural gas prices and demand for natural gas could influence the level of drilling activity in the markets that we serve  which may influence the level of throughput we may be able to transport on our pipeline 
further  natural gas price differences between the various hubs that we serve could influence customers to transport gas through our pipeline to capture arbitrage gains 
the results of atmos pipeline texas division are also significantly impacted by the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division because it is the primary supplier of natural gas for our mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

this increase was partially offset by a million increase in operating expenses largely attributable to increased depreciation expense as a result of increased capital investments and increased levels of pipeline and right of way maintenance activities to improve the safety and reliability of our system 
the apt rate case approved by the rrc on april  contained an annual adjustment mechanism  approved for a three year pilot program  that adjusted regulated rates up or down by percent of the difference between apt s non regulated annual revenue and a pre defined base credit 
the annual adjustment mechanism expired on june  apt requested to extend the annual adjustment mechanism until november  a hearing to review the request was held on october  with a final decision expected in december fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in regulated transmission and storage gross profit compared to the prior year was primarily a result of the rate case that was finalized and became effective in may as well as the grip filings approved by the rrc during fiscal and in may  the rrc issued an order in the rate case of atmos pipeline texas that approved an annual operating income increase of million 
during fiscal  the rrc approved the atmos pipeline texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of million that went into effect in the fiscal fourth quarter 
on april   the rrc approved the atmos pipeline texas grip filing with an annual operating income increase of million that went into effect with bills rendered on an after april  operating expenses increased million primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense  resulting from higher investment in net plant 

table of contents additionally  results for fiscal were favorably impacted by a state tax benefit of million associated with an update of the estimated tax rate at which deferred taxes would reverse in future periods after the completion of the sale of our missouri  illinois and iowa assets 
net income for this segment for fiscal was favorably impacted by a million pre tax gain recognized in march as a result of unwinding two treasury locks million  net of tax 
nonregulated segment our nonregulated operations are conducted through atmos energy holdings  inc aeh  a wholly owned subsidiary of atmos energy corporation and represent approximately five percent of our consolidated net income 
aeh primary business is to buy  sell and deliver natural gas at competitive prices to approximately  customers located primarily in the midwest and southeast areas of the united states 
aeh accomplishes this objective by aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and effectively managing commodity price risk 
aeh also earns storage and transportation demand fees primarily from our regulated natural gas distribution operations in louisiana and kentucky 
these demand fees are subject to regulatory oversight and are renewed periodically 
our nonregulated activities are significantly influenced by competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions 
therefore  the margins earned from these activities are dependent upon our ability to attract and retain customers and to minimize the cost of buying  selling and delivering natural gas to offer more competitive pricing to those customers 
further  natural gas market conditions  most notably the price of natural gas and the level of price volatility affect our nonregulated businesses 
natural gas prices and the level of volatility are influenced by a number of factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  the demand for natural gas in different parts of the country  the level of domestic natural gas production and the level of natural gas inventory levels 
natural gas prices can influence the demand for natural gas 
higher prices may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources 
conversely  lower prices could cause customers such as electric power generators to switch from alternative energy sources to natural gas 
collection of accounts receivable from customers  which could affect the level of bad debt expense recognized by this segment 
the level of borrowings under our credit facilities  which affects the level of interest expense recognized by this segment 
natural gas price volatility can also influence our nonregulated business in the following ways price volatility influences basis differentials  which provide opportunities to profit from identifying the lowest cost alternative among the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
increased or decreased volatility impacts the amounts of unrealized margins recorded in our gross profit and could impact the amount of cash required to collateralize our risk management liabilities 
our nonregulated segment manages its exposure to natural gas commodity price risk through a combination of physical storage and financial instruments 
therefore  results for this segment include unrealized gains or losses on its net physical gas position and the related financial instruments used to manage commodity price risk 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period

the impact of lower sales volumes was compounded by a decrease in per unit margins from cents per mcf to cents per mcf 
this decrease was offset by an increase of million in unrealized margins  primarily due to the year over year timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions 
operating expenses increased million  primarily due to increased litigation and software support costs  partially offset by reduced employee costs 
miscellaneous income increased million primarily due to a gain realized from the sale of a peaking power facility and related assets during the first quarter of fiscal fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  realized margins for gas delivery  storage and transportation services and other services were million during the year ended september  compared with million for fiscal the decrease reflects the following a nine percent decrease in consolidated sales volumes 
the decrease was largely attributable to warmer weather  which reduced sales to utility  municipal and other weather sensitive customers 
a mcf decrease in gas delivery per unit margins compared to the prior year primarily due to lower basis differentials resulting from increased natural gas supply and increased transportation costs 

table of contents unrealized margins increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the year over year timing of realized margins on the settlement of hedged natural gas inventory positions 
operating expenses  excluding asset impairments decreased million primarily due to lower employee related expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million noncash charge to impair our natural gas gathering assets located in kentucky 
the charge reflected a reduction in the value of the project due to the current low natural gas price environment and management s decision to focus aeh s activities on its gas delivery  storage and transportation services 
in fiscal  asset impairments included an asset impairment charge of million related to our investment in our fort necessity storage project as well as an million pre tax impairment charge related to the write off of certain natural gas gathering assets 
liquidity and capital resources the liquidity required to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs is provided from a variety of sources  including internally generated funds and borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities 
additionally  we have various uncommitted trade credit lines with our gas suppliers that we utilize to purchase natural gas on a monthly basis 
finally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets to fund our liquidity needs 
we regularly evaluate our funding strategy and profile to ensure that we i have sufficient liquidity for our short term and long term needs in a cost effective manner and ii maintain our debt to capitalization ratio in a target range of to percent 
the following table presents our capitalization as of september  and september in thousands  except percentages short term debt long term debt shareholders equity total capitalization  including short term debt total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and on january   we issued million of year unsecured senior notes  which  in effect  replaced our million year unsecured senior notes we redeemed in august  on a long term basis 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay million outstanding under our short term financing facility used to redeem our senior notes and to partially repay commercial paper borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
going forward  we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system 
we plan to continue to fund our growth and maintain a balanced capital structure through the use of long term debt securities and  to a lesser extent  equity 
further  million of long term debt will mature in october we plan to issue new senior notes to replace this maturing debt 
during the current year  we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps to fix the treasury yield component associated with this anticipated issuance at 
we believe the liquidity provided by our senior notes and committed credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows  will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs and capital expenditure program for fiscal year cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these factors include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors

in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows primarily are attributable to changes in net income  working capital changes  particularly within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases and purchased gas cost recoveries 
the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in the prior year 
the year over year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a million decrease in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans in the current year 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  for the fiscal year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million from operating activities compared with million in fiscal the year over year increase reflects changes in working capital offset by a million increase in contributions made to our pension and postretirement plans during fiscal cash flows from investing activities our ongoing capital expenditure program enables us to provide safe and reliable natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets and enhance the integrity of our pipelines 
in recent years  we have increased our level of capital spending to improve the safety and reliability of our distribution system and to expand our intrastate pipeline network 
over the last three fiscal years  approximately percent of our capital spending has been committed to improving the safety and reliability of our system 
over the next five years  we anticipate our capital spending will be more consistent with levels experienced during fiscal as we continue to invest in the safety and reliability of our distribution and transportation system 
where possible  we will also continue to focus our capital spending in jurisdictions that permit us to earn an adequate return timely on our investment without compromising the safety or reliability of our system 
for the fiscal year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the fiscal year ended september  and million for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending incurred for the line w and line wx expansion projects and increased cathodic protection spending in our regulated transmission and storage segment 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  the million increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily reflects spending for the steel service line replacement program in the mid tex division  the development of new customer billing and information systems for our natural gas distribution and our nonregulated segments and increased capital spending to increase the capacity on our atmos pipeline texas system 

table of contents cash flows from financing activities we received a net million and million in cash from financing activities for fiscal years and in fiscal  we used a net million in financing activities 
our significant financing activities for the fiscal years ended september   and are summarized as follows during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities generated million of cash compared with million of cash used in the prior year 
current year cash flows from financing activities were significantly influenced by the issuance of million year unsecured senior notes on january  we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of million to repay a million short term financing facility executed in fiscal  to settle  for million  three treasury locks associated with the issuance and to reduce short term debt borrowings by million 
during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities used million of cash  primarily due to the payment of million associated with the early redemption of our million senior notes that were scheduled to mature in january the repayment of our million senior notes was financed using a million short term loan 
additionally  we repurchased million of common stock under our share repurchase program 
during the fiscal year ended september   our financing activities generated million of cash  primarily related to the issuance of million senior notes in june and the related settlement of three treasury locks for million 
we used a portion of the net cash proceeds of million to pay scheduled long term debt repayments  including our million senior notes that were paid on their maturity date in may additionally  we received million cash in march related to the unwinding of two treasury locks

in the current year  employees were issued restricted stock units  for which we issued new shares 
in the prior year  employees were issued restricted stock awards  which were held in trust and did not require the issuance of new shares 
during fiscal  we canceled and retired  shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards which are not included in the table above 
at september   of the million shares authorized for issuance from the ltip  million shares remained available 
the decreased number of shares issued in fiscal compared with the number of shares issued in fiscal primarily reflects the exercise of a significant number of stock options during fiscal during fiscal  we canceled and retired  shares attributable to federal withholdings on equity awards and repurchased and retired  shares attributable to our share repurchase program  which are not included in the table above 
credit facilities our short term borrowing requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business 
changes in the price of natural gas and the amount of natural gas we need to supply to meet our customers needs could significantly affect our borrowing requirements 
we finance our short term borrowing requirements through a combination of a million commercial paper program  which is collateralized by our million unsecured credit facility  as well as three additional committed revolving credit facilities and one uncommitted revolving credit facility with third party lenders 
as a result  we have approximately billion of working capital funding 
additionally  our million unsecured credit facility has an accordion feature  which  if utilized  would increase borrowing capacity to billion 
we also use intercompany credit facilities to supplement the funding provided by these third party committed credit facilities 
shelf registration 
table of contents on march   we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to issue  from time to time  up to billion in common stock and or debt securities available for issuance  which replaced our registration statement that expired on march  as of september   billion was available under the shelf registration statement 
credit ratings our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risks associated with our regulated and nonregulated businesses and the regulatory environment in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings  ltd 
fitch 
our current debt ratings are all considered investment grade and are as follows s p moody s fitch unsecured senior long term debt a baa a commercial paper a p f on october   s p upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to a from bbb  with a ratings outlook of stable  citing an improved business risk profile from an increasing contribution of earnings from our regulated operations and focusing our nonregulated operations on our delivered gas business 
a significant degradation in our operating performance or a significant reduction in our liquidity caused by more limited access to the private and public credit markets as a result of deteriorating global or national financial and credit conditions could trigger a negative change in our ratings outlook or even a reduction in our credit ratings by the three credit rating agencies 
this would mean more limited access to the private and public credit markets and an increase in the costs of such borrowings 
a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
the highest investment grade credit rating is aaa for s p  aaa for moody s and aaa for fitch 
the lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb for s p  baa for moody s and bbb for fitch 
our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant

with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of individual contracts 
our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of natural gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under the terms of these contracts as of september  are reflected in the table above 
aeh has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts 
at september   aeh was committed to purchase bcf within one year  bcf within one to three years and bcf after three years under indexed contracts 
aeh is committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 

table of contents risk management activities as discussed above in our critical accounting policies  we use financial instruments to mitigate commodity price risk and  periodically  to manage interest rate risk 
we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the financial instruments being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we record our financial instruments as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying financial instrument 
substantially all of our financial instruments are valued using external market quotes and indices 
the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our natural gas distribution segment s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september  in thousands fair value of contracts at september  contracts realized settled fair value of new contracts other changes in value fair value of contracts at september  the fair value of our natural gas distribution segment s financial instruments at september   is presented below by time period and fair value source fair value of contracts at september  maturity in years source of fair value less than greater than total fair value in thousands prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our nonregulated segment s financial instruments for the fiscal year ended september  in thousands fair value of contracts at september  contracts realized settled fair value of new contracts other changes in value fair value of contracts at september  netting of cash collateral cash collateral and fair value of contracts at september  
table of contents the fair value of our nonregulated segment s financial instruments at september   is presented below by time period and fair value source 
fair value of contracts at september  maturity in years source of fair value less than greater than total fair value in thousands prices actively quoted prices based on models and other valuation methods total fair value employee benefits programs an important element of our total compensation program  and a significant component of our operation and maintenance expense  is the offering of various benefits programs to our employees 
these programs include medical and dental insurance coverage and pension and postretirement programs 
medical and dental insurance we offer medical and dental insurance programs to substantially all of our employees  and we believe these programs are consistent with other programs in our industry 
since  we have experienced medical and prescription inflation of approximately four percent 
in recent years  we have strived to actively manage our health care costs through the introduction of a wellness strategy that is focused on helping employees to identify health risks and to manage these risks through improved lifestyle choices 
in march  president obama signed the patient protection and affordable care act into law the health care reform act 
the health care reform act will be phased in over an eight year period 
we have changed the design of our health care plans to comply with provisions of the health care reform act that have already gone into effect or will be going into effect in future years 
we will continue to monitor all developments on health care reform and continue to comply with all existing relevant laws and regulations 
for fiscal  we anticipate an approximate six percent medical and prescription drug inflation rate  primarily due to anticipated higher claims costs and the implementation of the health care reform act 
net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs for the fiscal year ended september   our total net periodic pension and other benefits costs was million  compared with million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and these costs relating to our natural gas distribution operations are recoverable through our gas distribution rates 
a portion of these costs is capitalized into our gas distribution rate base  and the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
our fiscal costs were determined using a september  measurement date 
at that date  interest and corporate bond rates utilized to determine our discount rates were lower than the interest and corporate bond rates as of september   the measurement date for our fiscal net periodic cost 
as a result of the lower interest and corporate bond rates  we decreased the discount rate used to determine our fiscal pension and benefit costs to percent 
our expected return on our pension plan assets was maintained at percent due to historical experience and the current market projection of the target asset allocation 
as a result  our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs were higher than in the prior year 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits costs during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects the decrease in our discount rate at september   the measurement date for our fiscal pension and postretirement costs 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
at our september  measurement date  the interest and corporate bond rates used to determine our fiscal net periodic pension cost were significantly lower than the rates at september   the measurement date used to determine our fiscal net periodic cost 
our expected return on our pension plan assets was reduced to percent due to historical experience and the then current market projection of the target asset allocation 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount that will at least equal the minimum amount required to comply with the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
however  additional voluntary contributions are 
table of contents made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
in accordance with the pension protection act of ppa  we determined the funded status of our plans as of january  based on this valuation  we were required to contribute cash of million  million and million to our pension plans during fiscal  and the higher level of contributions experienced during fiscal and reflect lower discount rates than in previous years 
each contribution increased the level of our plan assets to achieve a desirable ppa funding threshold 
we contributed million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the fiscal years ended september  and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal and beyond as of september   interest and corporate bond rates were higher than the rates as of september  therefore  we increased the discount rate used to measure our fiscal net periodic cost from percent to percent 
however  we decreased the expected return on plan assets from percent to percent in the determination of our fiscal net periodic pension cost based upon expected market returns for our targeted asset allocation 
as a result of the net impact of changes in these and other assumptions  we expect our fiscal net period pension cost to decrease by less than five percent 
based upon market conditions subsequent to september   the current funded position of the plans and the funding requirements under the ppa  we anticipate contributing between million and million to the plans in fiscal further  we will consider whether an additional voluntary contribution is prudent to maintain certain ppa funding thresholds 
with respect to our postretirement medical plans  we anticipate contributing between million and million during fiscal actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension costs ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement costs by approximately million 
the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and nonregulated segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our nonregulated segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial instruments including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment 
table of contents we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
therefore  our natural gas distribution operations have limited commodity price risk exposure 
nonregulated segment our nonregulated segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our nonregulated segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during
