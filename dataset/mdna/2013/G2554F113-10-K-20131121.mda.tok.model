the increase in net sales for endomechanical instruments was primarily due to increased sales of stapling products driven by growth of our tri staple tm product 
in addition  the current year benefited from the duet product recalls in the prior year and the impact of our fiscal acquisition of superdimension  which resulted in an additional million in net sales 
the increase in net sales of oximetry monitoring was primarily due to the acquisition of oridion in fiscal  which contributed million to the increase in net sales and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of pulse oximetry sensors

the increase in sales for vascular products was primarily due to increased sales of neurovascular products and  to a much lesser extent  peripheral vascular and chronic venous insufficiency products 
the increase in net sales for energy devices primarily resulted from higher sales volume of vessel sealing products  most notably in the united states 
increased sales of stapling devices within endomechanical instruments driven by growth for our tri staple tm product were more than offset by the recall and discontinuance of our duet product and decreased sales of surgical instruments

these increases in corporate expenses were partially offset by a decrease in expense associated with our annual incentive plan and the release of a withholdings tax reserve resulting from a statute expiration 
the decrease in corporate expenses in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily due to lower finance departmental costs and decreased legal and environmental expenses

the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily resulted from the implementation of tax planning strategies  including the release of certain valuation allowances 
these decreases to our effective tax rate were partially offset by a favorable settlement reached with certain non us taxing authorities in fiscal  compared to an unfavorable settlement reached with certain non us taxing authorities in fiscal  the release of certain us and us uncertain tax positions due to statute expirations in fiscal  and the expiration of the us research and development credit as of december  and the retroactive re enactment of the credit during the first quarter of fiscal discontinued operations mallinckrodt the historical results of operations of our pharmaceuticals business have been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income

on a pre tax basis  these charges totaled million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
in connection with the separation  we entered into a transition services agreement pursuant to which covidien and mallinckrodt are providing to each other  on an interim transitional basis  various services 
the services generally commenced on the separation date and terminate up to months following the separation  although certain services may continue for longer periods 
services provided by covidien include certain information technology  back office support and distribution and importation services for products in certain countries outside the united states 
the charges for such services are generally intended to allow the service provider to recover all out of pocket costs and expenses and realize a predetermined profit equal to a mark up of such out of pocket expenses 
billings by covidien under the transition services agreement are recorded as a reduction of the costs to provide the respective service in the applicable expense category in the consolidated statement of income 
the amount of profit recognized by covidien in fiscal was insignificant 
this transitional support will enable mallinckrodt to establish its stand alone processes for various activities that were previously provided by covidien and does not constitute significant continuing support of mallinckrodt s operations

the working capital outflow was driven largely by a million increase in accounts receivable  million of net indemnification activity under the tyco tax sharing agreement and a million increase in inventory  partially offset by a million increase in income taxes payable 
in addition  we made million in voluntary pension contributions during fiscal this payment was primarily made to provide additional funding to mallinckrodt plans prior to the separation 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities of billion in fiscal was primarily attributable to net income  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  partially offset by a net change in working capital of million 
the net change in working capital was driven largely by an increase in inventory of million  partially offset by an increase in income taxes payable of million 
at the end of june  we collected million from the spanish government  which related to and prior invoices 
in addition  during fiscal  we made net indemnification payments of million related to pre separation tax matters under the tyco tax sharing agreement 
net cash provided by operating activities of billion in fiscal was primarily attributable to net income  as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes  partially offset by an increase of inventory of million and a decrease in income taxes payable of million 
the decrease in income taxes payable primarily resulted from a million advance payment that we made to the irs in connection with the proposed settlements of us tax audits for the years through and other non us audits 
we were partially reimbursed by tyco international and te connectivity for this payment under the tyco tax sharing agreement 
in addition  we made indemnification payments to tyco international and te connectivity under the tyco tax sharing agreement for tax matters in which they were the primary obligor 
the total net payment made  including the advance payment to the irs  was million 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million  billion and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
acquisitions during fiscal we paid total cash of million for acquisitions  million of which related to the acquisition of cvi  million of which related to the acquisition of cns therapeutics  inc  which was acquired by our former pharmaceuticals segment  and million of which related to the acquisition of nfocus 
during fiscal  we paid total cash of billion for acquisitions  of which million was for the acquisition of oridion  million was for the acquisition of b rrx  million was for the acquisition of superdimension  and the remainder was for all other acquisitions 
capital spending capital expenditures were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect capital expenditures to decrease in fiscal as a result of the separation 
capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of million to million in fiscal financing activities net cash used in financing activities was billion  million and billion in fiscal  and  respectively 
debt issuances and repayments as discussed in capitalization  during fiscal  we issued debt for net proceeds of approximately billion  of which million was issued by mallinckrodt international finance sa mifsa  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of mallinckrodt upon separation 
upon completion of the separation  we transferred to mallinckrodt proceeds that  together with cash held by mifsa subsidiaries  totaled million 
the remaining million of debt was issued by covidien international finance sa cifsa  a wholly owned subsidiary of covidien plc 
we used a portion of the million of proceeds to fund the redemption of all our outstanding million senior notes due june during fiscal  we also used million of cash to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
during fiscal  we issued debt for net proceeds of approximately billion 
we used a portion of these proceeds to fund the redemption of all of our outstanding million notes due october in addition  during fiscal  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of commercial paper 
during fiscal  we used million of cash to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program and paid million upon the maturity of our senior notes 
share repurchases and option exercises we repurchased approximately million shares for billion in fiscal  million shares for million in fiscal and million shares for million in fiscal under our share buyback programs 
we also repurchased shares from certain employees in order to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements in connection with the vesting of restricted shares and to settle certain option exercises 
we spent million  million and million to acquire shares in connection with these equity based awards during fiscal  and  respectively 
share repurchases were somewhat offset by proceeds from options exercises of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
dividend payments dividend payments were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect our cash dividend payments to increase in fiscal as a result of the increase in our quarterly dividend rate discussed in dividends 

table of contents free cash flow we returned   and of our operating cash flow to shareholders in fiscal  and  respectively  through a combination of both dividend payments and share repurchases 
free cash flow returned to shareholders was   and in fiscal  and  respectively 
free cash flow was billion in fiscal  compared with billion in fiscal the million decrease in free cash flow primarily resulted from the collection of million of accounts receivable from the spanish government during fiscal  an increase in separation costs and the separation of our pharmaceuticals business 
in the next months  we expect to make a net payment of approximately million related to pre separation tax matters under the tyco tax sharing agreement  of which approximately million relates to the anticipated settlement of the through audit cycles discussed under commitments and contingencies income taxes 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure  which should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for our reported financial results prepared in accordance with us gaap

a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities the most comparable us gaap measure and free cash flow is as follows dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures free cash flow capitalization shareholders equity was billion at september   compared with billion at september  the decrease in shareholders equity was primarily due to the repurchase of shares of billion and the distribution of mallinckrodt in the amount of billion  partially offset by net income of billion 
the following table contains several key measures to gauge our financial condition and liquidity at the end of each fiscal year dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents current maturities of long term debt long term debt total debt shareholders equity debt to total capital ratio as of september   our cash and cash equivalents were held principally in subsidiaries which are located throughout the world 
under current laws  substantially all of these amounts can be repatriated to our luxembourg subsidiary  cifsa  which is the obligor of substantially all of our debt  and to our irish parent company  however  the repatriation of these amounts could subject us to additional tax costs 
we provide for tax liabilities in our financial statements with respect to amounts that we expect to repatriate  however  no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts that we consider to be permanently reinvested outside of ireland 
our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate earnings that are designated as permanently reinvested in order to fund our operations  including investing and financing activities 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due june the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by both covidien plc and covidien ltd 
the net proceeds of million were used to fund the redemption of all of our outstanding million senior notes due june and for general corporate purposes 
in connection with the separation  on april   mifsa  previously a wholly owned subsidiary of covidien  issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
upon completion of the separation  mifsa became a wholly owned subsidiary of mallinckrodt plc 
while mifsa retained the debt  mifsa 
table of contents retained for general corporate purposes only an amount of the net proceeds that  together with cash held by its subsidiaries totaled million 
the remainder of the net proceeds was retained by covidien for general corporate purposes 
we have a billion five year unsecured senior revolving credit facility  which expires in august in addition  we may increase this facility by up to million to a maximum of billion provided certain borrowing conditions are met 
we are required to maintain an available unused balance under our billion revolving credit facility sufficient to support amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program 
we had no commercial paper outstanding at september  and million of commercial paper outstanding at september  no amount was outstanding under our credit facility at the end of either period 
our credit facility agreement contains a covenant limiting our ratio of debt to earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
in addition  the agreement contains other customary covenants  none of which we consider restrictive to our operations 
we are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants 
dividends on september   our board of directors increased our quarterly cash dividend from per share to per share 
the dividend  which totaled million  was paid on november  to shareholders of record on october  the timing  declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our ordinary shares falls within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including the statutory requirements of irish law  our earnings and financial condition  the capital requirements of our businesses  industry practice and any other factors the board of directors deems relevant 
share repurchase programs we repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time based on market conditions and our cash flows to allow management to return excess cash to enhance shareholder value 
during fiscal  we completed our billion share repurchase program 
in august  our board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program  which was completed during fiscal in march  our board of directors authorized a billion share repurchase program 
as of september   billion remained outstanding under this program 
commitments and contingencies contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations and commitments for debt  minimum lease payment obligations under non cancelable operating leases and other obligations at september  is presented in the following table dollars in millions total thereafter debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations contingent consideration unrecognized tax benefits total contractual cash obligations interest payments are projected for future periods using the interest rates in effect as of september  certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates 
purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational and capital requirements 
the table above does not include other liabilities of billion  primarily consisting of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties  obligations under our pension plans  products liability and other legal accruals  obligations under our deferred compensation plan and environmental liabilities because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain 
the most significant of these liabilities are discussed below 
in addition to the amount of unrecognized tax benefits reflected in the table above  at september   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and million of related accrued interest and penalties for 
table of contents which we are unable to reasonably estimate the amount and period of payment 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding matters relating to income taxes  including unrecognized tax benefits 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  products liability matters  employment disputes  contractual disputes and other commercial disputes 
as of september   we had accruals for products liability and other legal matters totaling million  for which we had related insurance receivables of million 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding legal proceedings 
as of september   we had obligations under our deferred compensation plan of million and net unfunded pension obligations of million 
while the timing and amounts of long term funding requirements for these obligations are uncertain  in fiscal  we expect to make contributions of million to our pension plans and pay million of deferred compensation 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our pension plans  including the related assumptions 
we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites 
these projects relate to a variety of activities  including removal of solvents  metals and other hazardous substances from soil and groundwater 
the ultimate cost of cleanup and timing of future cash flows is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods 
as of september   we believe that it is probable that we will incur investigation and remedial costs of approximately million  of which million is included in accrued and other current liabilities and million is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september  note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding environmental matters  including asset retirement obligations 
legal proceedings we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including patent infringement claims  products liability matters  environmental matters  employment disputes  disputes on agreements and other commercial disputes 
we believe that these legal proceedings and claims likely will be resolved over an extended period of time 
although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these proceedings  based upon our experience  current information and applicable law  we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  one or more of the proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a future period 
further information regarding our legal proceedings is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements and in item legal proceedings 
guarantees we have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and te connectivity  which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities 
we assumed and are responsible for of these liabilities 
current and non current liabilities totaling million relating to these guarantees were included on our consolidated balance sheet at september   a substantial portion of which is classified as non current 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and indemnities to cover various risks and liabilities  including unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to disposition 
except as discussed below  we generally do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that these uncertainties would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
in connection with the sale of our specialty chemicals business in fiscal  our former pharmaceuticals business agreed to indemnify the purchaser with respect to various matters  including certain environmental  health  safety  tax and other matters up to a maximum of million 
the indemnification obligations relating to environmental  health and safety matters have a term of years  while some of the other indemnification obligations have an indefinite term 
the amount of the liability relating to all of these indemnification obligations included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at september  was million  of which million related to environmental  health and safety matters 
the value of the environmental  health and safety indemnity was measured based on the probability weighted present value of the costs expected to be incurred to address environmental  health and safety claims proposed under the indemnity 
we were required to pay million into an escrow account as collateral for all of these indemnification obligations to the purchaser  of which million remained in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet at september  during fiscal  we transferred the liability and the funds held in escrow to mallinckrodt in connection with the separation 
cifsa remains a guarantor of this liability  however  the value associated with the guarantee is insignificant 

table of contents in connection with the separation  mallinckrodt assumed the tax liabilities that are attributable to its subsidiaries  which total million 
we have indemnified mallinckrodt to the extent that such tax liabilities arising from periods prior to fiscal exceed million  net of certain tax benefits realized 
in addition  in connection with the separation  we entered into certain other guarantee commitments and indemnifications with mallinckrodt 
the values attributable to the tax indemnification and other guarantees were insignificant 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnification obligations included as part of environmental liabilities 
in addition  we are liable for product performance  however  in the opinion of management  such obligations will not significantly affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we have facility  vehicle and equipment operating leases that expire at various dates 
as of september   we had minimum lease payments for non cancelable operating leases as of million 
in addition  as of september   we had various outstanding letters of credit and guarantee and surety bonds totaling million  none of which were individually significant 
income taxes at september   we are the primary obligor to the taxing authorities for billion of tax liabilities that are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  of which billion relates to periods prior to our separation and which is shared with tyco international and te connectivity pursuant to the tyco tax sharing agreement 
however  the actual amounts that we may be required to ultimately accrue or pay under the tyco tax sharing agreement could vary depending upon the outcome of the unresolved tax matters  some of which may not be resolved for several years 
the irs has concluded its field examination of certain of tyco international s us federal income tax returns for the years through and proposed tax adjustments  several of which also affect our income tax returns for years after tyco international has appealed certain of the tax adjustments proposed by the irs and has resolved all but one of the matters associated with the proposed tax adjustments 
with respect to the outstanding issue that remains in dispute  on june   we were advised by tyco international that it had received notices of deficiency from the irs asserting that several of tyco international s former us subsidiaries owe additional taxes of million plus penalties of million based on audits of the through tax years of tyco international and its subsidiaries as they existed at that time 
these amounts exclude interest  and do not reflect the impact on subsequent periods if the irs position is ultimately proved correct 
the irs has asserted in the notices of deficiency that substantially all of tyco international s intercompany debt originating during the years through should not be treated as debt for us federal income tax purposes  and has disallowed interest deductions related to the intercompany debt and certain tax attribute adjustments recognized on tyco international s us income tax returns totaling approximately billion 
we strongly disagree with the irs s proposed adjustments 
on july   tyco international filed a petition to the us tax court contesting the irs assessment 
we believe there are meritorious defenses for the tax filings in question  that the irs positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and existing treasury regulations  and that the previously reported taxes for the years in question are appropriate 
no payments with respect to these matters or any additional matters that may be raised by the us tax court would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved  which  based on the experience of other companies  could take several years 
while we believe that the amounts recorded as non current taxes payable or guaranteed contingent tax liabilities related to these adjustments are adequate  the timing and outcome of such litigation is highly uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in particular  if the irs is successful in asserting its claim  it would likely assert that approximately billion of interest deductions with respect to tyco international s intercompany debt in subsequent time periods should also be disallowed 
the irs continues to audit certain of tyco international s us federal income tax returns for the years through and through audit cycles 
tyco international and the irs have entered into settlements related to certain outstanding tax matters arising in these audit cycles  which otherwise remain open and subject to examination and resolution of other matters 
in connection with the anticipated settlement of the through audit cycle  we estimate that we will be required to make a payment to the irs in fiscal of million  including interest of million 
this amount is included in current income taxes payable on the consolidated balance sheet 
pursuant to the tyco tax sharing agreement  we estimate that we will receive reimbursement payments totaling million from tyco international and te connectivity  which is included in the current due from former parent and affiliate 
we will also be required to reimburse tyco international and te connectivity for our portion of their settlements  which is estimated to be million 

table of contents the resolution of tax matters arising from the through us audits  non us audits and other settlements or statute of limitations expirations  could result in a significant change in our unrecognized tax benefits 
we estimate that within the next months  our liability related to uncertain tax positions  excluding interest  could decrease by as much as million primarily as a result of the anticipated partial settlement of the through audit cycle 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the tyco tax sharing agreement  we have recorded a current and non current receivable from tyco international and te connectivity of million as of september  this amount primarily reflects of our contingent tax liabilities that are subject to the tyco tax sharing agreement 
if tyco international and te connectivity default on their obligations to us under the tyco tax sharing agreement  however  we would be liable for the entire amount of such liabilities 
additional information regarding the tyco tax sharing agreement is provided in note to our consolidated financial statements 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  derivative financial instruments and accounts receivable 
we invest our excess cash in deposits or money market funds and diversify the concentration of cash among different financial institutions that have at least an a credit rating 
counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are limited to major financial institutions with at least a moody s and standard poor s long term debt rating of a a while we do not require collateral or other security to be furnished by the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments  we minimize exposure to credit risk by dealing with a diversified group of major financial institutions and actively monitoring outstanding positions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivable are generally limited due to our large number of customers and their diversity across many geographic areas 
a portion of our trade accounts receivable outside the united states  however  include sales to government owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries  which are subject to payment delays 
payment is dependent upon the financial stability of those countries national economies and the creditworthiness of those countries national governments 
deteriorating credit and economic conditions in parts of western europe  particularly in spain  italy and portugal  may continue to increase the average length of time it takes us to collect our accounts receivable in certain regions within these countries 
we routinely evaluate all government receivables for potential collection risks associated with the availability of government funding and reimbursement practices 
while we have not incurred significant losses on government receivables  if the financial condition of customers or the countries healthcare systems continue to deteriorate such that their ability to make payments is uncertain  charges may be required in future periods 
our aggregate accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  in spain  italy and portugal and as a percent of our total outstanding accounts receivable at the end of each fiscal year are as follows dollars in millions accounts receivable  net in spain  italy and portugal percentage of total accounts receivable  net net sales to customers in spain  italy and portugal totaled million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
at the end of june  we collected million from the spanish government  which related to and prior invoices 
accounts receivable  net in spain  italy and portugal over days past due were million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred from us to the buyer  which may be upon shipment or upon delivery to the customer site  based on contract terms or legal requirements in non us jurisdictions 
we sell products both direct to end user customers and through distributors who resell the products to end user customers 
rebates are provided to certain distributors that sell to end user customers at prices determined in accordance with a contract between us and the end user customer 
provisions for rebates  as well as sales discounts and returns  are accounted for as a 
table of contents reduction of sales when revenue is recognized and are included in the reserve for returns  rebates and sales allowances within accounts receivable trade on our consolidated balance sheets 
we estimate rebates based on sales terms  historical experience and trend analyses 
in estimating rebates  we consider the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the distributor s rebate claim  distributor specific trend analyses  contractual commitments  including stated rebate rates  and other relevant information 
we adjust reserves to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience  and record such adjustment as a reduction of sales in the period of adjustment 
historical adjustments to recorded reserves have not been significant and we do not expect significant revisions of these estimates in the future 
rebates charged against gross sales in fiscal  and amounted to billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
goodwill in performing goodwill assessments  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  and transactions and market place data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses  there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated 
we calculate our goodwill valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows of each reporting unit 
this approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates  discount factors and income tax rates 
changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we test goodwill during the fourth quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
we utilize a two step approach 
the first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units through internal analyses and valuation  using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
to determine the implied fair value of goodwill  we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the results of our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal showed that the fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values 
other intangible assets intangible assets primarily consist of completed technology  customer relationships  trademarks and in process research and development ipr d 
we record intangible assets at cost and amortize certain of such assets using the straight line method over five to forty years 
we review intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets  estimated using an income approach  with their carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the intangible asset  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of future cash flows 
we assess the remaining useful life and the recoverability of finite lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually 
the valuation of ipr d is determined using the discounted cash flow method 
in determining the value of ipr d  we consider  among other factors  the stage of completion of the projects  the technological feasibility of the projects  whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition and includes a rate of return which accounts for the time value of money  as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized 
the value attributable to ipr d projects at the time of acquisition is capitalized as an intangible asset 
note to our consolidated financial statements provides additional information regarding our ipr d projects 
contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions  we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as revenue  regulatory or commercialization based milestones 
as of the acquisition date  we recorded contingent liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay 
we remeasure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value in our consolidated statements of income 
increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from such things as changes in the timing  expected probability and or amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and or timing of achieving regulatory  commercialization or other milestones  as well as changes in discount rates and periods 
during fiscal  we recorded income of million representing the decrease in the estimated fair value of these obligations 
during fiscal and  we recorded expense of million and million  respectively  representing the increases in the estimated fair value of these obligations 

table of contents contingencies we are involved  both as a plaintiff and a defendant  in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business  including patent infringement  products liability and environmental matters  as further discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accruals recorded for various contingencies including legal proceedings  self insurance and other claims  are based on judgment  the probability of losses and  where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel  internal and or external technical consultants and actuarially determined estimates 
when a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made  we record the minimum loss contingency amount  which could be zero 
an estimate is often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known and is reevaluated each accounting period 
as information becomes known  additional loss provision is recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased 
when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected  our best estimate is changed to a lower amount 
we record receivables from third party insurers up to the amount of the related liability when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement 
in making this determination  we consider applicable deductibles  policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers 
receivables are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation 
pension benefits our pension expense and obligations are developed from actuarial valuations 
two critical assumptions in determining pension expense and obligations are the discount rate and expected long term return on plan assets 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
other assumptions reflect demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover and are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect our actual experience 
actual results may differ from actuarial assumptions 
the discount rate is used to calculate the present value of the expected future cash flows for benefit obligations under our pension plans 
for our us plans  we use a broad population of moody s aa rated corporate bonds to determine the discount rate assumption 
all bonds are non callable  denominated in us dollars and have a minimum amount outstanding of million 
this population of bonds was used to generate a yield curve and associated spot rate curve  to discount the projected benefit payments for the us plans 
the discount rate is the single level rate that produces the same result as the spot rate curve 
for our non us plans  the discount rate is generally determined by reviewing country specific and region specific government and corporate bond interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of pension benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
a basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase our present value of pension obligations by approximately million 
we consider the current and expected asset allocations of our pension plans  as well as historical and expected long term rates of return on those types of plan assets  in determining the expected long term return on plan assets 
in determining the expected return on pension plan assets  we consider the relative weighting of plan assets by class and individual asset class performance expectations as provided by external advisors in reaching our conclusions on appropriate assumptions 
our overall investment objective is to obtain a long term return on plan assets that is consistent with the level of investment risk that is considered appropriate 
investment risks and returns are reviewed regularly against benchmarks to ensure objectives are being met 
a basis point decrease in the expected long term return on plan assets would increase our annual pension expense by approximately million 
guarantees we have guarantee commitments and indemnifications with tyco international and te connectivity  which relate to certain contingent tax liabilities 
these arrangements were valued upon separation from tyco international using appraisals and a liability related to these guarantees was recorded 
each reporting period  we evaluate the potential loss which we believe is probable 
to the extent such potential loss exceeds the amount of the liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  an adjustment is recorded to increase the liability to the amount of such potential loss 
to date  this guarantee has not been amortized into income because there has been no predictable pattern of performance 
as a result  the liability generally will be reduced upon release from our obligations  which may not occur for some years  or  as payments are made to indemnified parties 
we consider the impact of such payments in our periodic evaluation of the sufficiency of the liability 
in addition  we have  from time to time  provided guarantees and indemnifications to unrelated parties 
these guarantees have not been material to our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically reassess our exposure and potential loss under these arrangements  and  in the event that an increase in the fair value of the guarantee occurs  a charge to income will be required 
income taxes in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative 
table of contents losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
in estimating future taxable income  we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
the tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty 
to the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position  an income tax liability is established 
we adjust these liabilities as a result of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is significantly different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
a significant portion of our potential tax liabilities are recorded in non current income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheets as payment is not expected within one year 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes  however  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
we have recorded significant valuation allowances in certain jurisdictions  which we intend to maintain until it appears to be more likely than not that some or all of those deferred tax assets will be realized 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets of billion and billion at september  and september   respectively  relate principally to the uncertainty of the utilization of certain deferred tax assets  primarily tax loss and credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions 
included in the valuation allowance at september  and september  is billion and billion  respectively  substantially all of which represents a full valuation allowance against certain non us net operating losses recorded in fiscal as a result of the receipt of a favorable tax ruling 
it is highly unlikely that any of this net operating loss will be utilized 
we believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the tax benefits related to the net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  any reduction in future taxable income  including any future restructuring activities  may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
our income tax expense recorded in the future may also be reduced to the extent of decreases in our valuation allowances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
in order to manage the volatility to our more significant market risks  we enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts 

table of contents foreign currency exposures foreign currency risk arises from our investments in affiliates and subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries 
such risk is also a result of transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
we use foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts on accounts and notes receivable  accounts payable  intercompany loan balances and forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our existing contracts  a appreciation of the us dollar from market rates would increase the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
a depreciation of the us dollar would decrease the unrealized value of contracts on our consolidated balance sheet by million and million as of september  and september   respectively 
however  such gains or losses on these contracts would ultimately be offset by the gains or losses on the revaluation or settlement of the underlying transactions
