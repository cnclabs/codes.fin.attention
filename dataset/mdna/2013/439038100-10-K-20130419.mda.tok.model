item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the risk factors detailed below should be considered in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
if any of these risks actually materialize  our business  financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
there may be additional risks that are presently unknown to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial that could affect our business 
we rely on offshore sourcing  particularly from china  for predominantly all of our casegoods furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
consequently a disruption in supply from china or from our most significant chinese supplier could adversely affect our ability to timely fill customer orders for these products and decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
in fiscal  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of our import purchases and the factory in china from which we directly source the largest portion of our import products accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported products 
a disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory currently on hand and in transit to our us warehouses in martinsville  va to adequately meet demand for approximately five and a half months with up to an additional three and a half months available for immediate shipment from our warehouses in asia 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for up to five to six months before remedial measures could be implemented 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources or at comparable cost  a disruption in our supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 

table of contents our dependence on non us suppliers could  over time  adversely affect our ability to service customers  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
we rely exclusively on non us suppliers for our casegoods furniture products and for a significant portion of our upholstered products 
our non us suppliers may not provide goods that meet our quality  design or other specifications in a timely manner and at a competitive price 
if our suppliers do not meet our specifications  we may need to find alternative vendors  potentially at a higher cost  or may be forced to discontinue products 
also  delivery of goods from non us vendors may be delayed for reasons not typically encountered for domestically manufactured furniture  such as shipment delays caused by customs issues  labor issues  port related issues such as weather  congestion or port equipment  decreased availability of shipping containers and or the inability to secure space aboard shipping vessels to transport our products 
our failure to timely fill customer orders due to an extended business interruption for a major non us supplier  or due to transportation issues  could negatively impact existing customer relationships and decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
our inability to accurately forecast demand for our imported products could cause us to purchase too much  too little or the wrong mix of inventory  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
manufacturing and delivery lead times for our imported products necessitate that we make forecasts and assumptions regarding current and future demand for these products 
if our forecasts and assumptions are inaccurate  we may purchase excess or insufficient amounts of inventory 
if we purchase too much or the wrong mix of inventory  we may be forced to sell it at lower margins  which could decrease sales  earnings and liquidity 
if we purchase too little or the wrong mix of inventory  we may not be able to fill customer orders and may lose market share and weaken or damage customer relationships which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
supplier transitions due to cost or quality competitiveness could result in longer lead times and shipping delays  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
inflation concerns  and to a lesser extent quality and supplier viability concerns  affecting some of our imported product suppliers located in china have prompted us to source more of our products from lower cost and or higher quality suppliers located in other asian countries  such as vietnam and indonesia  and we expect this transition away from suppliers located in china to continue 
this transition involves significant planning and coordination by and between the company and our new suppliers in these countries 
despite our best efforts and those of our new sourcing partners  these transition efforts are likely to result in longer lead times and shipping delays  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
changes in the value of the us dollar compared to the currencies for the countries from which we obtain our products could adversely affect our sales  earnings and liquidity 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing with our foreign suppliers in us dollars  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk but could choose to do so in the future 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we must pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
these price changes could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity during affected periods 
we are subject to changes in foreign government regulations and in the political  social and economic climates of the countries from which we source our products  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
changes in political  economic  and social conditions  as well as in the laws and regulations in the foreign countries from which we source our products could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
these changes could make it more difficult to provide products and service to our customers or could increase the cost of those products 
international trade regulations and policies of the united states and the countries from which we source finished products could adversely affect us 
imposition of trade sanctions relating to imports  taxes  import duties and other charges on imports affecting our products could increase our costs and decrease our earnings 
for example since  the us department of commerce has imposed tariffs on wooden bedroom furniture coming into the united states from china 
in this case  none of the rates imposed have been of sufficient magnitude to alter our import strategy in any meaningful way  however  these and other tariffs are subject to review and could be implemented or increased in the future 

table of contents a disruption affecting our henry county  virginia warehouse  distribution or headquarters facilities could disrupt our business and decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
our henry county  virginia facilities are critical to our success 
our henry county  virginia warehouses housed approximately of our consolidated inventories at february   with approximately stored at our central distribution center cdc facility also located in henry county  virginia 
during fiscal  approximately of our invoiced sales were shipped out of our henry county  va facilities  with shipped out of the cdc 
additionally  our corporate headquarters  which houses all of our corporate administration  sourcing  sales  finance  product design  customer service and traffic functions for our imported products is located in this area 
any disruption affecting the cdc facility or a combination of our other facilities in this area  for even a relatively short period of time  could adversely affect our ability to ship our imported furniture products and disrupt our business  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
the implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could disrupt our business which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
we are in the process of implementing a company wide enterprise resource planning erp system 
our erp system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations 
our inability to mitigate existing and future disruptions could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
the erp system implementation subjects us to substantial costs and inherent risks associated with migrating from our legacy systems 
these costs and risks could include  but are not limited to significant capital and operating expenditures  disruptions to our domestic and international supply chains  inability to fill customer orders accurately and on a timely basis  or at all  inability to process payments to suppliers  vendors and associates accurately and in a timely manner  disruption of our internal control structure  inability to fulfill our sec or other governmental reporting requirements in a timely or accurate manner  inability to fulfill federal  state and local tax filing requirements in a timely or accurate manner  and increased demands on management and staff time to the detriment of other corporate initiatives 
the interruption or failure of our information systems or information technology infrastructure could adversely impact our business  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
our information systems software and information technology hardware infrastructure platforms and those of third parties providing these services to us  facilitate and support every facet of our business  including the sourcing of raw materials and finished goods  planning  manufacturing  warehousing  customer service  shipping  accounting and human resources 
our systems and those of third parties providing services to us are vulnerable to disruption or damage caused by a variety of factors including  but not limited to  power disruptions or outages  natural disasters  computer system or network failures  viruses or malware  physical or electronic break ins  unauthorized access and cyber attacks 
if these information systems are interrupted or fail  our operations may be adversely affected  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
if demand for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture declines and we respond by realigning manufacturing  our near term earnings could decrease 
our domestic manufacturing operations make only upholstered furniture 
a decline in demand for our domestically produced upholstered furniture could result in the realignment of domestic manufacturing operations and capabilities and the implementation of cost savings programs 
these programs could include the consolidation and integration of facilities  functions  systems and procedures 
we may decide to source certain products from other suppliers instead of continuing to manufacture them 
these realignments and cost savings programs typically involve initial upfront costs and could result in decreases in our near term earnings before the expected cost savings are realized  if they are realized at all 
we may not always accomplish these actions as quickly as anticipated and may not fully achieve the expected cost savings 

table of contents we may experience impairment of our long lived assets  which would decrease our earnings and net worth 
accounting rules require that long lived assets be tested for impairment when circumstances indicate  but at least annually 
at february  we had million in net long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  trademarks and trade names 
the outcome of impairments testing could result in the write down of all or a portion of the value of these assets 
a write down of our assets would  in turn  reduce our earnings and net worth 
over the past three fiscal years  we have written down an aggregate of approximately million in long lived assets 
it is possible that we will have additional write downs in the future  resulting in additional reductions to our earnings and net worth 
factors which may lead to additional write downs of our long lived assets include  but are not limited to a significant decrease in the market value of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with a long lived asset s use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
we may not be able to maintain or raise prices in response to inflation and increasing costs 
competitive and market forces could prohibit future successful price increases for our products in order to offset increased costs of finished goods  raw materials  freight and other product related costs  which could decrease our earnings and liquidity 
economic downturns could result in decreased sales  earnings and liquidity 
the furniture industry is particularly sensitive to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects 
home furnishings are generally considered a postponable purchase by most consumers 
economic downturns could affect consumer spending habits by decreasing the overall demand for home furnishings 
these events could also impact retailers  our primary customers  possibly resulting in a decrease in our sales  earnings and liquidity 
changes in interest rates  consumer confidence  new housing starts  existing home sales  the availability of consumer credit and geopolitical factors have particularly significant effects on us 
a recovery in our sales could lag significantly behind a general recovery in the economy after an economic downturn due to the postponable nature and relatively significant cost of home furnishings purchases 
we may lose market share due to competition  which likely would decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
the furniture industry is very competitive and fragmented 
we compete with numerous domestic and foreign residential furniture sources 
some competitors have greater financial resources than we have and often offer extensively advertised  well recognized  branded products 
competition from foreign sources has increased dramatically over the past decade 
we may not be able to meet price competition or otherwise respond to competitive pressures  including increases in supplier and production costs 
also  due to the large number of competitors and their wide range of product offerings  we may not be able to continue to differentiate our products through value and styling  finish and other construction techniques from those of our competitors 
in addition  some large furniture retailers are sourcing directly from asian furniture factories 
over time  this practice may expand to smaller retailers 
as a result  we are continually subject to the risk of losing market share  which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
failure to anticipate or timely respond to changes in fashion and consumer tastes could adversely impact our business and decrease sales  earnings and liquidity 
furniture is a styled product and is subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer tastes  as well as to increasingly shorter product life cycles 
if we fail to anticipate or promptly respond to these changes we may lose market share or be faced with the decision of whether to sell excess inventory at reduced prices 
this could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 

table of contents a loss of several large customers through business consolidations  failures or other reasons could result in a decrease in sales  earnings and liquidity 
the loss of several of our major customers through business consolidations  failures or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our sales  earnings and liquidity 
lost sales may be difficult to replace 
amounts owed to us by a customer whose business fails  or is failing  may become uncollectible and we could lose future sales which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
our ability to grow and maintain sales and earnings depends on the successful execution of our business strategies 
we are primarily a residential furniture design  sourcing  marketing and logistics company with domestic upholstery manufacturing capabilities 
our ability to grow and maintain sales and earnings depends on the continued correct selection and successful execution and refinement of our overall business strategies and business systems for designing  marketing  sourcing  distributing and servicing our products 
we must also make good decisions about product mix and inventory availability targets 
since we are completely dependent on non us suppliers for all of our casegoods furniture products and a significant portion for our upholstered products  we must continue to enhance relationships and business systems that allow us to continue to work more efficiently and effectively with our global sourcing suppliers 
we must also continue to evaluate the appropriate mix between domestic manufacturing and foreign sourcing for upholstered products 
all of these factors affect our ability to grow and maintain sales  earnings and liquidity 
fluctuations in the price  availability or quality of raw materials for our domestically manufactured upholstered furniture could cause manufacturing delays  adversely affect our ability to provide goods to our customers or increase costs  any of which could decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
we use various types of wood  leather  fabric  foam and other filling material  high carbon spring steel  bar and wire stock and other raw materials in manufacturing upholstered furniture 
we depend on outside suppliers for raw materials and must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from these suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner 
we do not have long term supply contracts with our suppliers 
unfavorable fluctuations in the price  quality or availability of required raw materials could negatively affect our ability to meet the demands of our customers 
the inability to meet customers demands could result in the decreased sales  earning and liquidity 
we may not always be able to pass along price increases in raw materials to our customers due to competition and market pressures 
we may engage in acquisitions and investments in companies  form strategic alliances and pursue new business lines 
these activities could disrupt our business  dilute our earnings per share  decrease the value of our common stock and decrease our earnings and liquidity 
we may acquire or invest in businesses that offer complementary products and that we believe offer competitive advantages 
however  we may fail to identify significant liabilities or risks that could negatively affect us or result in our paying more for the acquired company or assets than they are worth 
we may also have difficulty assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired business into our current operations 
acquisitions may disrupt or distract management from our ongoing business 
we may pay for future acquisitions using cash  stock  the assumption of debt  or a combination of these 
future acquisitions could result in dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share and decrease the value of our common stock 
we may pursue new business lines in which we have limited or no experience or expertise 
these pursuits may require substantial capital investment 
they may fail outright or fail to produce an adequate return  which could decrease our earnings and liquidity

nature of operations hooker furniture corporation the company  we  us and our is a home furnishings marketing and logistics company offering worldwide sourcing of residential casegoods and upholstery  as well as domestically produced custom leather and fabric upholstered furniture 
we were incorporated in virginia in and are ranked among the nation s top largest publicly traded furniture sources  based on shipments to us retailers  according to a survey published by furniture today a leading trade publication 
we are a key resource for residential wood and metal furniture commonly referred to as casegoods and upholstered furniture 
our major casegoods product categories include home entertainment  home office  accent  dining and bedroom furniture under the hooker furniture brand 
our residential upholstered seating companies include hickory  nc based bradington young acquired in  a specialist in upscale motion and stationary leather furniture and bedford  va 
based sam moore furniture acquired in  a specialist in upscale occasional chairs  settees  sofas and sectional seating with an emphasis on cover to frame customization 
an extensive selection of designs and formats along with finish and cover options in each of these product categories makes us a comprehensive resource for residential furniture retailers  primarily targeting the upper medium price range 
our principal customers are retailers of residential home furnishings that are broadly dispersed throughout the united states 
our customers also include home furniture retailers in canada and in over other countries internationally 
our customers include independent furniture stores  specialty retailers  department stores  catalog and internet merchants  interior designers and national and regional chains 

table of contents overview consumer home furnishings purchases are driven by an array of factors  including general economic conditions such as consumer confidence  fashion trends  availability of consumer credit  energy and other commodity prices  and housing and mortgage markets  as well as lifestyle driven factors such as changes in disposable income  household formation and turnover  and family size 
the residential home furnishings industry experienced a significant and persistent decline in demand for its products from to current economic and economic related factors  such as high unemployment  relatively weak consumer confidence and changing consumer priorities have resulted in a somewhat depressed retail environment for discretionary home furnishings and related purchases 
the extended weakness in housing and housing related industries is beginning to show signs of sustained recovery  however  we expect any recovery in home furnishings to be slow and inconsistent due to the relatively high cost and postponable nature of many home furnishing product purchases 
results for our domestic upholstery operations  which have significantly higher overhead and fixed costs than our import operations  have been particularly affected by the decline in demand for home furnishings and  except for the first  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  have experienced operating losses since our fiscal second quarter 
extensive cost reduction efforts over that time have mitigated the losses and have resulted in our upholstery segment returning to operating profitability for fiscal our lower overhead  variable cost import operations have driven our profitability over the last few years and provide us with the flexibility to respond to changing demand by adjusting inventory purchases from suppliers 
our import model also requires that we transition sourcing among suppliers  often located in different countries or regions  when quality concerns or inflationary pressures diminish the value proposition offered by our current suppliers 
the following are the primary factors that affected our consolidated results of operations for fiscal out of stock positions on several key imported items  groups and collections negatively impacted sales and profitability  especially during the first half of fiscal  the sourcing transition from some of our vendors in china to vendors in other asian countries resulted in longer lead times 
related shipping delays negatively impacted sales and profitability in the first half of fiscal  and to a lesser extent during the second half of fiscal decreased product discounting negatively impacted sales and unit volume in both segments  but drove gross margin improvement 
product discounting and sales volume was higher in the comparable prior year periods in order to reduce excess and slow moving inventory  selling and administrative expenses decreased in absolute terms during fiscal and were flat as a percentage of net sales due to the factors described below  and our upholstery segment returned to operating profitability in fiscal after reporting operating losses since the fiscal second quarter 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items for the annual periods included in the consolidated statements of income fifty three weeks ended fifty two weeks ended february  january  january  net sales cost of sales casualty loss insurance recovery gross profit selling and administrative expenses restructuring charges intangible asset impairment charges operating income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales fifty three weeks ended fifty two weeks ended february  january  change change net sales net sales casegoods upholstery consolidated unit volume fy increase vs 
fy average selling price fy increase vs 
fy casegoods casegoods upholstery upholstery consolidated consolidated 
table of contents the decrease in consolidated net sales was principally due to lower unit volume  particularly in our casegoods segment  partially offset by higher average selling prices in both segments 
the casegoods sales decrease was driven by out of stock positions on several key items  groups and collections in the first half of the fiscal year and decreased discounting 
the out of stock positions were primarily due to overly aggressive inventory reductions that began in fiscal and continued into the fiscal first six months 
to a lesser extent and consistent with our fiscal fourth quarter  vendor shifts from china to other asian countries resulted in the delay of several well placed new casegoods collections and negatively impacted fiscal first six month sales 
these vendor shifts contributed to the out of stock positions and increased the demand for our best selling  in stock products 
this accelerated demand cycle hastened the out of stock position on best sellers 
sales of imported products in fiscal were driven by heavy discounting  intended to reduce inventory of slow selling and discontinued products

table of contents liquidity  financial resources and capital expenditures our loan agreement with bank of america  na  which is scheduled to expire on july   includes the following terms a million unsecured revolving credit facility  up to million of which can be used to support letters of credit  a floating interest rate  adjusted monthly  based on libor  plus an applicable margin based on the ratio of our funded debt to our ebitda each as defined in the agreement  a quarterly unused commitment fee  based on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda  and no pre payment penalty 
the loan agreement includes customary representations and warranties and requires us to comply with customary covenants  including  among other things  the following financial covenants maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  limit capital expenditures to no more than million during any fiscal year  and maintain a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not exceeding we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants at february  and expect to remain in compliance with existing covenants for the foreseeable future 
during the fiscal second quarter we amended our loan agreement to reduce the minimum required tangible net worth from million to million  primarily to provide additional flexibility to purchase our common shares under a share repurchase authorization approved by our board in april the loan agreement does not restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on  or repurchase shares of our common stock  subject to complying with the financial covenants under the agreement 
as of february   we had an aggregate million available under our revolving credit facility to fund working capital needs 
standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  used to collateralize certain insurance arrangements and for imported product purchases  were outstanding under the revolving credit facility as of february  there were no additional borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility on february  we are currently in negotiations with bank of america  na and other lenders to extend or replace our credit facility and expect to have a new agreement in place before the expiration of our current loan agreement on july  we factor substantially all of our domestic upholstery accounts receivable  in most cases without recourse to us 
we factor these receivables because factoring allows us to outsource the administrative burden of the credit and collections functions for our upholstery operations  allows us to transfer the collection risk associated with the majority of our domestic upholstery receivables to the factor  and provides us with an additional  potential source of short term liquidity 
we believe that we have the financial resources including available cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flow from operations  lines of credit and the cash surrender value of company owned life insurance needed to meet business requirements for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  and working capital  as well as to pay dividends on our common stock 
cash flow from operations is highly dependent on incoming order rates and our operating performance 
we expect to spend between million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal year to maintain and enhance our operating systems and facilities 
of these estimated amounts  we expect to spend between million to million on the implementation of our erp system in our upholstery segment 

table of contents enterprise resource planning our new enterprise resource planning erp system became operational for our casegoods and imported upholstery units early in the third quarter of fiscal  after nearly two years of design  planning  conversion and training efforts by our associates and consultants

in fiscal  million was capitalized into property  plant and equipment in the long term assets portion of our consolidated statement of financial position 
in fiscal  and  million  million and  was expensed  respectively  and appears in the selling and administrative expense sections of our consolidated statements of operations 
conversion efforts began for our domestic upholstery units early in the fiscal first quarter  with full implementation scheduled to be completed during fiscal once all our business units are operational on the erp platform  we expect to realize operational efficiencies and cost savings by presenting a single face to our customers and leveraging best practices across the organization 
to complete the erp system implementation as anticipated  we expect to expend significant financial and human resources 
we anticipate spending approximately million in additional funds over the remainder of this project  with a significant amount of time invested by our associates 
we refer you to item a 
risk factors included in this report for a more complete discussion of the risks involved in our erp system conversion and implementation 
share repurchase authorization during the fiscal first quarter  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares 
the authorization does not obligate us to acquire a specific number of shares during any period and does not have an expiration date  but it may be modified  suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of our board of directors 
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market  or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise  in compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations  and subject to our cash requirements for other purposes  compliance with the covenants under the loan agreement for our revolving credit facility and other factors we deem relevant 
we have entered into a trading plan under rule b and rule b of the securities exchange act of for effecting some or all of the purchases under this repurchase authorization 
the trading plan contains provisions that could restrict the amount and timing of purchases 
we can terminate this plan at any time

port workers strike sales of imported finished goods comprised approximately of our sales in fiscal we receive most of our imported finished goods through the east coast port of norfolk  va 
on august   contract negotiations for a new collective bargaining agreement between the united states maritime alliance  which represents the shipping industry  and the international longshoremen s association ila  whose members work in deep sea ports around the east and gulf coasts of the united states  were suspended 
however  negotiations were extended and the parties reached a new six year collective bargaining agreement on march  this agreement was ratified by ila members on april more than of our imported finished goods are shipped from the ports of hong kong and yantian 
near the end of march  dockworkers at the port of hong kong began to strike to demand a pay increase and a collective bargaining relationship with the container terminal operator hong kong international terminals hit 
hit operates five terminals at the port of hong kong 
the hong kong labor department is involved to try to resolve the situation 
a prolonged strike would likely disrupt the flow of inventory to us and our customers and decrease our sales  earnings and liquidity 
yantian is an alternative port of origin for shipments from the supplier owned warehouse dedicated to our inventory  and for most of our other suppliers in southern china  and can be utilized at the same cost as hong kong  which may help to mitigate the impact on our business from any lengthy work stoppage there 
other southern chinese ports such as zhongshan may offer additional options  though likely at higher cost

table of contents how did we perform right product we ended fiscal with strong order backlogs in both segments  increased upholstery net sales  the successful launch and reception of the sam moore sofa program and the rhapsody casegoods collection 
alignment of import supplier base we established representative offices in two new asian locations  transitioned a portion of our casegoods production to these new locations  exited eight underperforming suppliers  and reduced casegoods returns and allowances expense by 
achieve upholstery segment profitability our upholstery segment achieved profitability  realizing  in operating profit during fiscal build on fiscal casegoods volume and profitability increases while stock outs due to vendor transitions  aggressive inventory reductions and lower international sales dampened casegoods volume  the casegoods segment achieved increased gross and net profits and ended fiscal with improved sales momentum 
erp implementation erp implementation for our casegoods segment and imported upholstery segment went live over labor day weekend in however  implementation efforts for our upholstery segment did not begin in earnest until january of  as we worked to refine the new system for the casegoods segment after initial implementation 
based on our experiences in phase i  we extended the expected phase ii target implementation date to fiscal to allow the appropriate time and attention necessary to implement without a significant business disruption  consistent with the successful implementation of phase i 
strategy our strategy is to offer world class style  quality and product value as a complete residential casegoods and upholstered furniture resource through excellence in product design  global sourcing  manufacturing  logistics  sales  marketing and customer service 
we strive to be an industry leader in sales growth and profitability performance  thereby providing an outstanding investment for our shareholders and contributing to the well being of our customers  employees  suppliers and communities 
additionally  we strive to nurture the relationship focused  team oriented and honor driven corporate culture that has distinguished our company for over years 
in order to successfully execute our strategy in fiscal  we must continue to develop the right product  in other words  the product the consumer wants at a price the customer is willing to pay  continue to refine our import supplier base with our product standards for quality  delivery  value and cost by a 
continuing to develop existing successful supplier relationships  b 
continuing to develop our asian supply team to reduce product quality issues and costs  and c 
exiting non compliant suppliers for more promising supplier relationships in existing or new locales  if necessary 
build on upholstery segment profitability by continuing to focus on labor efficiency  cost reduction projects and volume increases driven by new and updated products and improved volume at key retailers  improve casegoods volume and build on its profitability increases by continued focus on offering strong product lines  limit discounting through improved inventory management and growing our international business  and work towards implementing our erp in our domestic upholstery operation in fiscal in addition to these goals  we intend to build on our fiscal efforts to connect directly with our consumers 
in fiscal  we ran two major advertising campaigns in house beautiful magazine featuring our highly regarded rhapsody collection 
rhapsody has been a top seller for us since its introduction at the april high point market and is a perfect match for the high end consumers who make up house beautiful s readership 
to maintain a dialog with consumers  we continue to reach out through social media and have expanded our social media presence to include facebook pages and advertising for bradington young and sam moore 
and to help our dealers connect with their customers  we launched a preferred dealer program to support marketing efforts by our key retailers  including assistance building an on line presence in their local markets using our istore technology 

table of contents expand into the senior living market 
during the first half of fiscal  we expect to launch our h contract to connect with the burgeoning senior living market  a market typically comprised of housing communities and facilities for retirement aged adults 
this division will supply upholstered seating and casegoods to upscale senior living facilities throughout the country 
under the direction of a year health care furniture veteran  this division will work with designers specializing in this industry segment to provide functional furniture for senior living facilities that meets newer retirees expectations for style and fashion 
launch our new homeware line 
to address the needs of the younger furniture customer we plan to launch homeware 
this line will feature modular upholstered and casegoods products designed to be assembled by the consumer and shippable by parcel delivery services  allowing for ease of purchase  setup and delivery  especially for on line and catalog shoppers 
using patented connectors designed by an experienced furniture engineer and designer  our goal is for the consumer to be able to assemble and disassemble these products in minutes  without tools 
we expect a launch date for the initial homeware product line in the summer of outlook most economic indicators suggest that economic recovery in the united states is well underway 
evidence of this recovery includes continued increases in household wealth  consumer confidence  disposable income and retail sales  including furniture store sales  as well as continued improvement in housing activity  which we believe to be a leading indicator for furniture sales 
however  we believe many consumers continue to be hesitant to commit to major purchases  such as furniture  due to persistent high unemployment levels and concerns about the domestic economy  high us national and consumer debt levels and persistent us federal budget deficits 
based on these positive and negative factors  as well as what we are seeing in the home furnishings marketplace  we expect retail furniture demand to improve  but modestly  as we progress through fiscal in light of current conditions  we continue to focus on the goals outlined above  which include pursuing additional distribution channels  controlling costs  adjusting our product pricing on our main line products in order to improve margins  achieving proper inventory levels  while optimizing product availability on best selling items  sourcing product from more competitive locations and from more quality conscious sourcing partners  offering an array of new products and designs  which we believe will help generate additional sales  and upgrading and refining our information systems capabilities to support our business 
we have seen significant improvement in our upholstery segment results in the past year thanks to higher sales volume and to a number of cost control initiatives 
the upholstery segment has higher fixed costs than our casegoods segment  due to the upholstery segment s domestic manufacturing operations  as well as one time start up costs for the introduction of sam moore s successful fully upholstered sofa line during the fiscal year 
to mitigate the impact of sales declines in recent years  we have continued to streamline our upholstery operations by improving efficiency  reducing overhead and evaluating our operating costs and capacity to better match costs to current sales volume levels 
further significant cost reductions in our upholstery segment will be challenging 
while we are encouraged by recent increases in sales and incoming orders  if we are unable to continue to increase and maintain sales in our upholstery segment  particularly sales of domestically produced upholstery  additional capacity reductions may be necessary 
if undertaken  these capacity reductions would likely result in restructuring and asset impairment charges  which would lower our consolidated net earnings in the short term for the quarterly and annual periods in which we recognize the charges and adversely affect our consolidated balance sheets for the periods then ended 
further capacity reductions also would increase the ratio of fixed to variable costs in our upholstery segment which would create pricing and cost absorption challenges 
environmental matters hooker furniture is committed to protecting the environment 
as a part of our business operations  our manufacturing sites generate non hazardous and hazardous wastes  the treatment  storage  transportation and disposal of which are subject to various local  state and national laws relating to protecting the environment 
we are in various stages of investigation  remediation or monitoring of alleged or acknowledged contamination at current or former manufacturing sites for soil and groundwater contamination  none of which we believe is material to our results of operations or financial position 
our policy is to record monitoring commitments and environmental liabilities when expenses are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the costs associated with our environmental responsibilities  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or costs otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  capital expenditures or competitive position 

table of contents we participate in a voluntary industry wide environmental stewardship program referred to as enhancing furniture s environmental culture or efec 
in september of fiscal  the american home furnishings alliance granted us initial efec registration  recognizing the successful company wide implementation of the efec program  which includes the successful reduction of water and electricity usage  recycling efforts to reduce landfill use and the implementation of a community outreach program 
since our initial registration we have recycled over  pounds of paper  cardboard and plastic  reduced electricity usage by an average of per year  and reduced natural gas usage by an average of per year 
we are inspected annually by the efec organization in order to maintain our registration under this program and are currently certified through january we face a number of significant risks and uncertainties  as more fully discussed in item a  risk factors beginning on page and in our forward looking statements beginning on page despite these risks and uncertainties  we believe that our business model and strategy offer a unique opportunity to successfully deliver shareholder value in the coming fiscal year 
critical accounting policies and estimates hooker furniture s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements beginning at page f in this report 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that actual results will deviate materially from our estimates related to our accounting policies described below 
however  because application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  we analyze the payment history of our significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and comparative accounts receivable aging statistics 
based on this information  along with consideration of the general condition of the economy  we develop what we consider to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in accounts receivable 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual uncollectible amounts may differ materially from our estimate 
valuation of inventories 
we value all of our inventories at the lower of cost using the last in  first out lifo method or market 
lifo cost for all of our inventories is determined using the dollar value  link chain method 
this method allows for the more current cost of inventories to be reported in cost of sales  while the inventories reported on the balance sheet consist of the costs of inventories acquired earlier  subject to adjustment to the lower of cost or market 
hence  if prices are rising  the lifo method will generally lead to higher cost of sales and lower profitability as compared to the first in  first out fifo method 
we evaluate our inventory for excess or slow moving items based on recent and projected sales and order patterns 
we establish an allowance for those items when the estimated market or net sales value is lower than their recorded cost 
this estimate involves significant judgment and actual values may differ materially from our estimate 
income taxes 
at times  tax law and generally accepted accounting principles differ in the treatment of certain income and expense items 
these items may be excluded or included in taxable income at different times than is required for gaap or book reporting purposes 
these differences may be permanent or temporary in nature 
we determine our annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences 
the rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
we consider the level and mix of income of our separate legal entities  statutory tax rates  business credits available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and permanent tax differences 
significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions that affect the annual tax rate 
any changes to the forecasted information may cause adjustments to the effective rate 
additional tax  interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in tax expense on a quarterly basis 
to the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature  that is  the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization  a deferred tax asset or liability is established 
to the extent that a deferred tax asset is created  we evaluate our ability to realize this asset 
if we determine that we will not be able to fully utilize deferred tax assets  we establish a valuation reserve 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences reverse 
restructuring and impairment of long lived assets tangible assets we regularly review our property  plant and equipment for indicators of impairment  as specified in the property  plant and equipment topic of the accounting standards codification 
although not exhaustive  this accounting guidance lists potential indicators of impairment  which we use to facilitate our review 
these potential indicators of impairment include a significant decrease in the market value of the long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset group is being used  or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in the legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct a long lived asset  
table of contents a current period operating or cash flow loss or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the long lived asset s use  and a current expectation that more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
the impairment test for our property  plant and equipment requires us to assess the recoverability of the value of the assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from use and eventual disposition of the assets 
we principally use our internal forecasts to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows used in our impairment analyses 
these forecasts are subjective and are largely based on management s judgment  primarily due to the changing industry in which we compete  changing consumer tastes  trends and demographics  and the current economic environment 
we monitor changes in these factors as part of the quarter end review of these assets 
while our forecasts have been reasonably accurate in the past  during periods of economic instability  uncertainty  or rapid change within our industry  we may not be able to accurately forecast future cash flows from our long lived assets and our future cash flows may be diminished 
therefore  our estimates and assumptions related to the viability of our long lived assets may change  and are reasonably likely to change in future periods 
these changes could adversely affect our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of financial position 
as of february   the fair value of our property  plant and equipment was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
when we conclude that any of these assets is impaired  the asset is written down to its fair value 
any impaired assets that we expect to dispose of by sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less estimated cost to sell  are no longer depreciated  and are reported separately as assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  if we expect to dispose of the assets in one year or less 
the costs to dispose of these assets are recognized when we commit to a plan of disposal 
severance and related benefits to be paid to terminated employees affected by the facility closings are recorded in the period when management commits to a plan of termination 
we recognize liabilities for these exit and disposal activities at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
asset impairment charges related to the closure of facilities are based on our best estimate of expected sales prices  less related selling expenses for assets to be sold 
the recognition of asset impairment and restructuring charges for exit and disposal activities requires significant judgment and estimates by management 
we reassess our accrual of restructuring and asset impairment charges each reporting period 
any change in estimated restructuring and related asset impairment charges is recognized in the period during which the change occurs 
intangible assets we own certain indefinite lived intangible assets related to bradington young  sam moore and opus designs by hooker 
we may acquire additional amortizable assets and or indefinite lived intangible assets in future asset purchases or business combinations 
the principal indefinite lived intangible assets are trademarks and trade names  which are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets is determined based on the estimated earnings and cash flow capacity of those assets 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets with their carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the indefinite lived intangible assets exceeds their fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
trade names are tested for impairment annually as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
circumstances that could indicate a potential impairment include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in the economic or business climate either within the furniture industry or the national or global economy  significant changes in demand for our products  loss of key personnel  and the likelihood that a reporting unit or significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our intangible assets are highly subjective and judgmental and include long term growth rates  sales volumes  projected revenues  assumed royalty rates and factors used to develop an applied discount rate 
if the assumptions that we use in these calculations differ from actual results  we may realize additional impairment on our intangible assets which may have a material  adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents during the fiscal fourth quarter  we recorded a million million after tax  or per share intangible asset impairment charge to write down the value of our upholstery segment s bradington young trade name  due to operating losses in that division over preceding years and near term performance expectations 
despite this charge  we believe we have taken the proper steps to adjust capacity and reduce the cost structure at bradington young and expect it to continue to contribute to consolidated profitability 
at january   the fair value of our bradington young trade name exceeded its carrying value by approximately  and the fair value of our sam moore trade name was approximately  in excess of its carrying value 
concentrations of sourcing risk we source imported products through over different vendors  from separate factories  located in seven countries 
because of the large number and diverse nature of the foreign factories from which we can source our imported products  we have some flexibility in the placement of products in any particular factory or country 
factories located in china are an important resource for hooker furniture 
in fiscal year  imported products sourced from china accounted for approximately of import purchases  and the factory in china from which we directly source the most product accounted for approximately of our worldwide purchases of imported product 
a sudden disruption in our supply chain from this factory  or from china in general  could significantly impact our ability to fill customer orders for products manufactured at that factory or in that country 
if such a disruption were to occur  we believe that we would have sufficient inventory currently on hand in and in transit to our us warehouses in martinsville  va to adequately meet demand for approximately five and a half months  with an additional three and a half months available for immediate shipment from our asia warehouse 
also  with the broad spectrum of product we offer  we believe that  in some cases  buyers could be offered similar product available from alternative sources 
we believe that we could  most likely at higher cost  source most of the products currently sourced in china from factories in other countries and could produce certain upholstered products domestically at our own factories 
however  supply disruptions and delays on selected items could occur for five to six months 
if we were to be unsuccessful in obtaining those products from other sources  or at comparable cost  then a sudden disruption in the supply chain from our largest import furniture supplier  or from china in general  could have a short term material adverse effect on our results of operations 
given the capacity available in china and other low cost producing countries  we believe the risks from these potential supply disruptions are manageable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates  which could impact our results of operations or financial condition 
we manage our exposure to this risk through our normal operating activities 
for imported products  we generally negotiate firm pricing denominated in us dollars with our foreign suppliers  typically for periods of at least one year 
we accept the exposure to exchange rate movements beyond these negotiated periods 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage this risk  but could choose to do so in the future 
most of our imports are purchased from suppliers located in china 
the chinese currency floats within a limited range in relation to the us dollar  resulting in exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
since we transact our imported product purchases in us dollars  a relative decline in the value of the us dollar could increase the price we pay for imported products beyond the negotiated periods 
we generally expect to reflect substantially all of the effect of any price increases from suppliers in the prices we charge for imported products 
however  these changes could adversely impact sales volume or profit margins during affected periods 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility would bear interest at variable rates 
in the past  we have entered into swap agreements to hedge against the potential impact of increases in interest rates on our floating rate debt instruments 
there was no outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility as of february   other than standby letters of credit in the amount of million 
therefore  a fluctuation in market interest rates of one percentage point or basis points would not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition
