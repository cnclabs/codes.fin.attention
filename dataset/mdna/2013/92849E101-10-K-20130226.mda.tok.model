government regulation the formulation  manufacturing  processing  labeling  packaging  advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by several federal agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the consumer product safety commission  the us department of agriculture usda and the environmental protection agency epa 
these activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold 
pursuant to the fdca  the fda regulates the processing  formulation  safety  manufacture  packaging  labeling and distribution of dietary supplements including vitamins  minerals  and herbs and cosmetics 
the ftc has jurisdiction to regulate the advertising of these products 

table of contents the fdca has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements  in particular by the dietary supplement health and education act of dshea 
dshea established a new framework governing the composition  safety  labeling and marketing of dietary supplements 
dietary supplements are defined as vitamins  minerals  herbs  other botanicals  amino acids and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet  as well as concentrates  metabolites  constituents  extracts or combinations of such dietary ingredients 
generally  under dshea  dietary ingredients that were on the market prior to october  may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the fda 
new dietary ingredients ie  not marketed in the us prior to october  must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the fda unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered 
a new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the fda at least days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient 
the fda has issued guidance regarding the content of a new dietary ingredient notification 
while the guidance is not enforceable  it represents the fda s current point of view 
should the fda enforce the guidance as written  it would have a negative effect on the innovation and continued marketing of dietary supplements 
there is no certainty that the fda will accept any particular evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient 
the fda s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients 
dshea permits statements of nutritional support to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without premarket fda approval 
such statements must be submitted to the fda within days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that this statement has not been evaluated by the food and drug administration 
this product is not intended to diagnose  treat  cure  or prevent any disease 
such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure  function or general well being of the body  or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure  function or well being  but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose  cure  mitigate  treat  or prevent a disease 
a company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading 
if the fda were to determine that a particular statement of nutritional support was an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a disease claim for a food product  or if the fda were to determine that a particular claim was not adequately supported by existing scientific data or was false or misleading  we would be prevented from using that claim 
in addition  dshea provides that so called third party literature  eg a reprint of a peer reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits  may be used in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling 
such literature must not be false or misleading  the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement  and a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter must be presented 
if the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements  we may be prevented from disseminating such literature with our products  and any dissemination could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug 
the fda adopted final regulations regarding gmp  in manufacturing  packing  or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements  authorized by dshea on june  gmp regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared  packaged and held in compliance with strict rules  and require quality control provisions similar to those in the gmp regulations for drugs 
the fda could inspect one of our facilities or those of one of our contract manufacturers and determine that the facility was not in compliance with these regulations  and cause affected products made or held in the facility to be subject to fda enforcement actions 
the fda has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the fdca applicable to foods  dietary supplements  and cosmetics including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company  to publicize information about illegal products  to request a recall of illegal products from the market  and to request the united states department of justice to initiate a seizure action  an injunction action  or a criminal prosecution in the united states courts 
the regulation of foods  dietary supplements and cosmetics may increase or become more restrictive in the future 
legislation could be passed which would impose substantial new regulatory requirements for dietary supplements 
such potential legislation could impose new requirements which could raise our costs and hinder our business 
the ftc exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of foods  dietary supplements and cosmetics 
in recent years  the ftc has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims 
as a result of our efforts to comply with applicable statutes and regulations  we have from time to time reformulated  eliminated or relabeled certain of our products and revised certain provisions of our sales and marketing program 
the ftc has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to foods  dietary supplements and cosmetics  including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees  injunctions  and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved 
failure to comply with the ftc s laws and regulations could impair our ability to market our products 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  in evaluating our company and our business 

table of contents unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of our products and any similar products distributed by other companies could cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  resulting in decreased sales 
we depend significantly on consumer perception regarding the safety and quality of our products  as well as similar products distributed by other companies 
consumer perception of products can be significantly influenced by adverse publicity in the form of published scientific research  national media attention or other publicity  whether or not accurate  that associates consumption of our products or any other similar products with illness or other adverse effects  or questions the benefits of our or similar products or that claims that any such products are ineffective 
a new product may initially be received favorably  resulting in high sales of that product  but that sales level may not be sustainable as consumer preferences change 
future scientific research or publicity could be unfavorable to our industry or any of our particular products and may not be consistent with earlier favorable research or publicity 
unfavorable research or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate sales 
for example  in  sales of some of our products  such as those containing ephedra  were initially strong  but decreased as a result of negative publicity and an ultimate ban by the fda in april as a result of the above factors  our operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our failure to appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for new products and services could significantly harm our customer relationships and sales 
our business is subject to changing consumer trends and preferences 
our failure to accurately predict or react to these trends could negatively impact consumer opinion of us as a source for the latest products  which in turn could harm our customer relationships and cause us to lose market share 
the success of our new product offerings depends upon a number of factors  including our ability to anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new products  successfully commercialize new products in a timely manner  price our products competitively with retail and online competitors  deliver our products in sufficient volumes and in a timely manner  and differentiate our product offerings from those of our competitors 
if we do not introduce new products or make enhancements to meet the changing needs of our customers in a timely manner  some of our products could be rendered obsolete  which could have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
we may incur material product liability claims  which could increase our costs and adversely affect our reputation  sales and operating income 
as a retailer and direct marketer of products designed for human consumption  we are subject to product liability claims if the use of our products is alleged to have resulted in injury or include inadequate instructions for use or inadequate warnings concerning possible side effects and interactions with other substances 
most of our products are vitamins  minerals  herbs and other ingredients that are classified as foods or dietary supplements and are not subject to pre market regulatory approval in the united states 
our products could contain contaminated substances  and some of our products contain ingredients that do not have long histories of human consumption 
previously unknown adverse reactions resulting from human consumption of these ingredients could occur 
while we attempt to manage these risks by obtaining indemnification agreements and insurance  our insurance policies may not be sufficient or available and or third parties may not satisfy their commitments to us 
a product liability claim against us could result in increased costs and could adversely affect our reputation with our customers  which in turn could adversely affect our financial performance 
we may not be able to obtain insurance coverage in the future at current rates 
our current insurance program is consistent with both our past level of coverage and our risk management policies 
while we believe we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future  because of increased selectivity by insurance providers we may only be able to obtain such insurance at increased rates and or with reduced coverage levels which could reduce our income from operations 
compliance with governmental regulations could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our operating income 
the processing  formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  advertising and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies  including the fda  the ftc  the usda and the epa 
these activities are also regulated by various state  local and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold 
regulations may prevent or delay the introduction  or require the reformulation  of our products  which could result in lost sales and increased costs to us 
the fda may not accept the evidence of safety for any new ingredients that we may want to market  may determine that a particular product or product ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk  may determine that a particular statement of nutritional support on our products  or that we want to use on our products  is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a food health claim 
the fda or the ftc may determine that particular claims are not adequately supported by available scientific evidence 
any such regulatory determination would prevent us from marketing particular products or using certain statements on our products which could adversely affect our sales of those products 

table of contents we may experience product recalls  which could reduce our sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
we may be subject to product recalls  withdrawals or seizures in the event any of the products we sell is believed to cause injury or illness or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations in the labeling  promotion  sale or distribution of such products 
a significant recall  withdrawal or seizure of any of the products we sell may require significant management attention  would likely result in substantial and unexpected expenditures and may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
furthermore  a recall  withdrawal or seizure of any of our products may adversely affect consumer confidence in our brands and decrease demand for our products 
as is common in the vms industry  we rely on our third party vendors to ensure that the products they manufacture and sell to us comply with all applicable regulatory and legislative requirements 
in general  we seek representations and warranties  indemnification and or insurance from our vendors 
however  even with adequate insurance and indemnification  any claims of non compliance could significantly damage our reputation and consumer confidence in our products 
in addition  the failure of such products to comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements could prevent us from marketing the products or require us to recall or remove such products from the market  which in certain cases could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  products manufactured by third parties that contain dimethylpentylamine dimethylamylamine dimethylamylamine dmaa are among our top selling products 
although we have received representations from our third party vendors that these products comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements  media articles have suggested that dmaa may not comply with the dietary supplement health and education act of on april   the us food and drug administration fda announced that it had issued warning letters to ten manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements containing dmaa for allegedly marketing products for which evidence of the safety of the product had not been submitted to fda 
the fda also indicated that the warning letters advised the companies that the fda is not aware of evidence or history of use to indicate that dmaa is safe 
if it is determined that dmaa does not comply with applicable regulatory and legislative requirements  we could be required to recall or remove from the market all products containing dmaa and we could become subject to lawsuits related to any alleged non compliance  any of which recalls  removals or lawsuits could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the indeterminable level of product substitution and reformulated product sales  we cannot reliably determine the potential impact of any such recall or removal on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
regulatory agencies may impose additional laws or regulations or change current laws or regulations  and compliance with new or changed governmental regulations could increase our costs significantly and adversely affect our operating income 
from time to time  congress  the fda  the ftc or other federal  state  local or foreign legislative and regulatory authorities may impose additional laws or regulations that apply to us  repeal laws or regulations that we consider favorable to us or impose more stringent interpretations of current laws or regulations 
we are not able to predict the nature of such future laws  regulations  repeals or interpretations or to predict the effect that additional governmental regulation  when and if it occurs  would have on our business in the future 
those developments could require reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  recalls or discontinuance of certain products not able to be reformulated  additional record keeping requirements  increased documentation of the properties of certain products  additional or different labeling  additional scientific substantiation  adverse event reporting or other new requirements 
any such developments could increase our costs significantly and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see business government regulation 
in addition  on july   the fda issued draft guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients ndis 
we believe that the draft guidance  if implemented as proposed  would have a material impact on our operations 
fda enforcement of the ndi guidance as written  could require us to incur additional expenses  which could be significant  and negatively impact our business in several ways  including  but not limited to  the detention and refusal of admission of imported products  the injunction of manufacturing of any dietary ingredients or dietary supplements until the fda determines that such ingredients or products are in compliance  and the potential imposition of penalties for non compliance 
each of these events would increase our liability and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we rely on contract manufacturers to produce the vitamin shoppe  bodytech  true athlete and other proprietary branded products we sell 
disruptions in our contract manufacturers systems or losses of manufacturing certifications could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships 
our contract manufacturers produce of our vitamin shoppe  bodytech  true athlete and other proprietary branded products 
any significant disruption in those operations for any reason  such as regulatory requirements and loss of certifications  power interruptions  fires  hurricanes  war or threats of terrorism could adversely affect our sales and customer relationships 
increase in the price and shortage of supply of key raw materials could adversely affect our business 
our products are composed of certain key raw materials 
if the prices of these raw materials were to increase significantly  it could result in a significant increase to us in the prices our contract manufacturers and third party manufacturers charge us for our vitamin shoppe  
table of contents bodytech  true athlete and other proprietary branded products and third party products 
raw material prices may increase in the future and we may not be able to pass on such increases to our customers 
a significant increase in the price of raw materials that cannot be passed on to customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if we no longer are able to obtain products from one or more of our suppliers on terms reasonable to us or at all  our revenues could suffer 
we purchased over of our vitamin shoppe  bodytech  true athlete and other proprietary branded products from nature s value  inc events such as the threat of terrorist attacks or war  or the perceived threat thereof  may also have a significant adverse effect on raw material prices and transportation costs for our products 
in addition  the interruption in supply of certain key raw materials essential to the manufacturing of our products  may have an adverse impact on our suppliers ability to provide us with the products we need to maintain our customer relationships and an adequate level of sales 
we currently rely primarily on a single warehouse and distribution facility to distribute most of the products we sell 
disruptions to our warehouse and distribution facility could adversely affect our business 
our primary warehouse and distribution operations are currently concentrated in a single location adjacent to our corporate headquarters in new jersey 
although we have added a west coast distribution logistics solution to our operations during to service certain of our west coast stores and are planning to open a new distribution center in ashland  virginia in fiscal  any significant disruption to our primary distribution center operations for any reason  such as a flood  fire or hurricane  could adversely affect our product distributions and sales until we are able to secure an alternative distribution method 
our new store base  or any stores opened in the future  may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis or at all 
in addition  our growth strategy includes the addition of a significant number of new stores each year 
we may not be able to successfully implement this strategy on a timely basis or at all  and our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully negotiate favorable lease terms 
since the beginning of  we have aggressively pursued new store growth by opening new stores through fiscal in existing and new markets 
historically  our new stores have reached sales that are consistent with our mature stores over the course of approximately four to five years 
new stores opened since the beginning of  or any new stores we open in the future  may not achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base in this time frame or at all 
the failure of our new store base to achieve sales and operating levels consistent with our mature store base on a timely basis will have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
as of january   we leased stores along with our corporate headquarters and distribution facility 
the store leases are generally for a term of ten years and we have options to extend most leases for a minimum of five years 
our business  financial condition  and operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to negotiate acceptable lease and renewal terms 
in addition  our growth continues to depend  in part  on our ability to open and operate new stores successfully 
the success of this strategy depends upon  among other things  the identification of suitable sites for store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease terms  the hiring  training and retention of competent sales personnel  and the effective management of inventory to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis 
our continued expansion will also place increased demands on our operational  managerial and administrative resources 
these increased demands could cause us to operate our business less effectively  which in turn could cause deterioration in the financial performance of our existing stores 
further  our new store openings may result in reduced net sales volumes in the direct channel  as well as in our existing stores in those markets 
we expect to fund our expansion through cash flow from operations and  if necessary  by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
if we experience a decline in performance  we may slow or discontinue store openings 
if we fail to successfully implement these strategies  our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and our failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our sales and growth prospects 
the us nutritional supplements retail industry is a large and highly fragmented industry 
in  no single industry participant accounted for more than of total domestic industry sales 
we compete primarily against other specialty retailers  supermarkets  drugstores  mass merchants  multi level marketing organizations and mail order companies 
this market is highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
as certain products become more mainstream  we experience increased competition for those products 
for example  as the trend in favor of low carb products developed  we experienced increased competition for our low carb products from supermarkets  drug stores  mass merchants and other food companies 
increased competition from companies that distribute through retail  internet or wholesale channels could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  our competitors may be more effective and efficient in introducing new products 
we may not be able to compete effectively  and any of the factors listed above may cause price reductions  reduced margins and losses of our market share 
the loss of key management could negatively affect our business 
our success largely depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior executive group and key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key executives or personnel  or the increased demands placed on our key executives and personnel by our continued growth could adversely affect our financial performance and our ability to execute our strategies 
our continued success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified team members to meet our future growth needs 
we may not be able to attract and retain necessary team members to operate our business 

table of contents if we fail to protect our brand name  competitors may adopt tradenames that dilute the value of our brand name 
we may be unable or unwilling to strictly enforce our trademarks in each jurisdiction in which we do business 
in addition  because of the differences in foreign trademark laws concerning proprietary rights  our trademarks may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they do in the united states 
also  we may not always be able to successfully enforce our trademarks against competitors  or against challenges by others 
our failure to successfully protect our trademarks could diminish the value and efficacy of our past and future marketing efforts  and could cause customer confusion  which could  in turn  adversely affect our sales and profitability 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims by others 
we may be subject to intellectual property litigation and infringement claims initiated by others  other competitors or entities may assert rights in  or ownership of  our trademarks and other intellectual property rights or in marks that are similar to ours  and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
claims and litigation of this nature could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling or using some of our products  which could  in turn  adversely affect our sales and profitability 
changes in accounting standards and estimates could materially impact our results of operations 
generally accepted accounting principles and the related authoritative guidance for many aspects of our business  including revenue recognition  inventories  goodwill and intangible assets  leases  income taxes and stock based compensation  are complex and involve subjective judgments 
changes in these rules or changes in the underlying estimates  assumptions or judgments by our management could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
for example  proposed authoritative guidance for lease accounting  once finalized and enacted  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
disruptions in our information systems could harm our ability to run our business 
we rely extensively on information systems for point of sale processing in our stores  our e commerce business  supply chain  financial reporting  human resources and various other processes and transactions 
our information systems  including those provided and maintained by third party service providers are subject to damage or interruption from power outages  computer and telecommunications failures  computer viruses and security breaches that could result in the compromise of confidential company data 
if our systems are damaged  breached or cease to function properly  we may suffer interruptions in our operations  and may incur significant costs to fix or replace them 
any material interruption in our information systems may have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
if we fail to protect the integrity and security of customer and health enthusiast information  we could be exposed to litigation  increased costs and reputational damage  and our business could be adversely affected 
the use of individually identifiable data by us  our customers  our health enthusiasts and others is regulated at the state  federal and international levels 
privacy and information security laws and regulations change from time to time  and increasing costs of compliance with those laws and regulations and related technology investments could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially 
additionally  the success of our online operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks  including the use of cashless payments 
while we have taken significant steps to protect customer and confidential information  the intentional or negligent actions of health enthusiasts  our suppliers or others may undermine our security measures 
as a result  unauthorized parties may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate confidential data 
furthermore  because the methods used to obtain unauthorized access change frequently and may not be immediately detected  we may be unable to anticipate these methods or promptly implement preventative measures 
if our data security is compromised  it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  operating results and financial condition  materially increase the costs we incur to protect against those events in the future and subject us to additional legal risk 
in addition  our customers could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to stop shopping at our stores or online 
the loss of confidence from a data security breach involving health enthusiasts could hurt our reputation and cause health enthusiast recruiting and retention challenges 
potential reliance on future indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have in the past and may again in the future rely on debt financing to help fund our growth plans 
if we again incur material debt financing  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic  industry and competitive conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  new store growth and other capital expenditures  research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional funds 

table of contents recent legislation regarding healthcare may adversely affect our results of operations 
in march  comprehensive health care reform legislation under the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care education and affordability reconciliation act was passed and signed into law 
provisions of this law have become and will become effective at various dates over the next several years  and many of the regulations and guidance for the law have not been implemented 
due to the breadth and complexity of this law  the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance and the phased in nature of the implementation  we cannot predict the future effect of this law on our business 
in part because it may increase the costs of providing medical insurance to our health enthusiasts and we may be unable to pass on these costs to our customers  the new law may adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
our international operations may result in additional market risks  which may harm our business 
we entered the canadian market in and operate stores in canada and also distribute products to other countries as of december  as our international operations expand  they may require greater management and financial resources 
international operations require the integration of personnel with varying cultural and business backgrounds and an understanding of the relevant differences in the cultural  legal and regulatory environments 
our results may be increasingly affected by the risks of our international activities  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in international staffing and employment issues  tariff and other trade barriers  greater difficulty in using and enforcing our intellectual property rights  failure to understand the local culture and market  inconsistent product regulation or sudden policy changes by foreign agencies or governments  compliance with foreign laws  including tax laws and financial accounting standards  and political and economic instability and developments 
natural disasters and unusually adverse weather conditions could cause permanent or temporary damage to our distribution center or stores  impair our ability to purchase  receive or replenish inventory or cause customer traffic to decline  all of which could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 
the occurrence of one or more natural disasters  such as hurricanes  fires  floods  earthquakes  tornadoes  high winds and other severe weather  could adversely affect our operations and financial performance 
to the extent these events result in the closure of our distribution centers  our corporate headquarters  a significant number of our stores  or to the extent they adversely affect one or more of our key suppliers  our operations and financial performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries to our stores and through lost sales 
in addition  these events could result in increases in fuel or other energy prices or a fuel shortage  delays in opening new stores  the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market  the temporary or long term disruption in the supply of products from suppliers  delay in the delivery of goods to our distribution centers or stores  the temporary reduction in the availability of products in our stores and disruption to our information systems 
these events also could have indirect consequences  such as increases in the cost of insurance  if they were to result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage 
if we fail to successfully integrate the assets of super supplements  inc into our operations  it could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
difficulties in assimilating the acquired assets of super supplements  inc into our operations may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to integrate the operations of super supplements  inc  including its personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general operating procedures 
we also may not be able to retain key personnel 
if we fail to successfully integrate the assets of super supplements  inc  we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
also  the acquisition and integration of the assets of super supplements  inc may not meet or exceed our expectations and  therefore  may adversely affect our financial performance 
our e commerce business is subject to third party dependencies 
changes in business practices or terms by such third parties could have an adverse impact on our financial results 
our e commerce business has several third party relationships that contribute to our ability to generate revenue from a variety of online sources 
these relationships may be dependent upon third party tools  such as search engines  or established business terms negotiated by the company 
if the economics of these relationships or the use of the third party tools utilized to drive revenue change materially  this could affect our decision to maintain these relationships  and could result in lost sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance 

table of contents failure to successfully open our new distribution center could have an adverse effect on our business 
if we fail to successfully open our new distribution center  we could experience increased costs associated with diminished productivity and operating inefficiencies related to the flow of goods through our supply chain which could have an adverse affect on our financial results

trends and other factors affecting our business our performance is affected by trends that affect the vms industry  including demographic  health and lifestyle preferences 
changes in these trends and other factors  which we may not foresee  may also impact our business 
for example  our industry is subject to potential regulatory actions  such as the announcement in april of warning letters sent by the us food and drug administration to ten manufacturers and distributors of dietary supplements containing dimethylpentylamine dimethylamylamine dimethylamylamine  or dmaa  and other legal matters that affect the viability of a given product 
potential regulatory trends  variable consumer trends  such as those described in the following paragraph  as well as the overall impact on consumer spending  which may be impacted heavily by current economic conditions  can dramatically affect purchasing patterns 
our business allows us to respond to changing industry trends by introducing new products and adjusting our product mix and sales incentives 
we will continue to diversify our product lines to offer items less susceptible to the effects of economic conditions 
sales of weight management products are generally more sensitive to consumer trends  such as increased demand for products recommended by media personalities  resulting in higher volatility than our other products 
our sales of weight management products have been significantly influenced by the rapid increase and subsequent decline of products such as those containing ephedra  low carb products  and certain thermogenic products 
accordingly  we launch new weight management products on an ongoing basis in response to prevailing market conditions and consumer demands 
as the rate of obesity increases and as the general public becomes increasingly more health conscious  we expect the demand for weight management products  albeit somewhat variable  to continue to be strong in the near term 

table of contents in addition to the weight management product lines  we intend to continue our focus in meeting the demands of an increasingly aging population  the effects of increasing costs of traditional healthcare and a rapidly growing fitness conscious public 
we believe that the aging of the us population provides us with an area of opportunity 
the us census bureau reports that the number of individuals in the and over age group is expected to increase to million people in from million people in  representing approximately times the overall population growth rate 
moreover  it is estimated that by the or older group will comprise of the population 
we tend to see that as people age they take on a more active role in maintaining or improving their health 
as the portion of population over age increases  we believe that we will have an increasing opportunity to drive sales 
we believe that as the costs of healthcare continue to increase  lower cost alternatives to prescription drugs and preventative supplementation will continue to be an option for the american consumer 
according to the center for medicare and medicaid services  medical spending as a percentage of gdp was in  and is projected to reach of gdp by as an increasing number of the population seeks to avoid costly medical issues and focuses on prevention through diet  supplementation and exercise  we expect the demand in this market segment to provide us with continued opportunities 
our historical results have also been significantly influenced by our new store openings 
since the beginning of  we have opened stores and operate stores located in states  the district of columbia  puerto rico and ontario  canada as of january  our stores typically require approximately four to five years to mature generating lower store level sales in the initial years than our mature stores 
as a result  new stores generally have a negative impact on our overall operating margin and sales per square foot 
as our recently opened stores mature  we expect them to contribute meaningfully to our operating results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those that are the most important portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements  our most critical accounting policies  discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  deferred sales for our healthy awards program  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
in applying such policies  we must use some amounts that are based upon our informed judgments and best estimates 
estimates  by their nature  are based on judgments and available information 
the estimates that we make are based upon historical factors  current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon sale of our products when merchandise is sold at point of sale in retail stores or upon delivery to a direct customer  net of sales returns 
in addition  we classify amounts billed to customers that represent shipping fees as sales 
to arrive at net sales  gross sales are reduced by deferred sales  actual customer returns  and a provision for estimated future customer returns  which is based on management s review of historical and current customer returns 
the net amounts reserved for sales returns were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
sales taxes collected from customers are presented on a net basis and as such are excluded from revenue 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the weighted average method 
as applied to inventories  cost means in principle the sum of the applicable expenditures and charges directly or indirectly incurred in bringing the product to its existing condition and location 
finished goods inventory includes costs on freight on internally transferred merchandise  rent for the distribution center and costs associated with our buying department and distribution facility  including payroll which are capitalized into inventory and then expensed as merchandise is sold 
in addition  the cost of inventory is reduced by purchase discounts and other allowances received from certain of our vendors 
we adjust our inventory to reflect situations in which the cost of inventory is not expected to be recovered 
we regularly review our inventory  including when a product is close to expiration and not expected to be sold  when a product has reached its expiration date  or when a product is not expected to be saleable 
in determining the reserves for these products we consider factors such as the amount of inventory on hand and its remaining shelf life  and current and expected market conditions  including management forecasts and levels of competition 
we have evaluated the current level of inventory considering historical trends and other factors  and based on our evaluation  have recorded adjustments to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
these adjustments are estimates  which could vary significantly from actual results if future economic conditions  customer demand or competition differ from expectations 
these estimates require us to make assessments about the future demand for our products in order to categorize the status of such inventory items as slow moving  expiring  obsolete or in excess of need 
these future estimates are subject to the ongoing accuracy of management s forecasts of market conditions  industry trends and competition 
we are also subject to volatile changes in specific product demand as a result of unfavorable publicity  government regulation and rapid changes in demand for new and improved products or services 
obsolescence reserves were million at both december  and december  
table of contents long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  periodically for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of our estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the asset s carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
these estimates of cash flow require significant management judgment and certain assumptions about future sales and expense growth rates  devaluation and inflation 
as such  these estimates may differ from actual cash flows 
the company recognized impairment charges of million during fiscal on fixed assets related to three of its underperforming retail locations still in use in the company s operations 
the company recognized impairment charges of million during fiscal on fixed assets related to three of its underperforming retail locations still in use in the company s operations 
during fiscal the company recognized an impairment charge of million on fixed assets related to three underperforming retail locations  one of which are still in use in the company s operations 
impairment charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
on an annual basis  or whenever impairment indicators exist  we perform an evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
in the absence of any impairment indicators  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are tested in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
with regards to goodwill  our tests are based on our two reporting units  and utilize the discounted cash flow method  based on our current operating projections  as well as the market multiples method 
for tradenames  we utilize the royalty relief method 
for those intangible assets which have definite lives  we amortize their cost on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  the periods of which vary based on their particular contractual terms 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of the business 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist  and therefore that goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired 
our impairment test involves calculating the fair value of both our reporting units our segments using the discounted cash flow method along with the market multiples method which is used for additional validation of the value calculated 
the use of the discounted cash flow valuation method requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain industry trends and future profitability of our reporting units 
it is our policy to conduct goodwill impairment testing from information based on our most current business projections  which include projected future revenues and cash flows 
the cash flows utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on five year financial forecasts developed internally by our management 
cash flows for each unit are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital which reflects the costs of borrowing for the funding of each unit as well as the risk associated with the units themselves and the industry they perform in 
we also conduct the test using a decrease in our revenue projections as an additional sensitivity test to ensure the reporting unit s fair value is greater than its carrying value even in a less favorable environment 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value 
to compute the implied fair value of goodwill  we would assign the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment loss to write down such goodwill to its implied fair value 
the valuation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is affected by  among other things  our business plan for the future and estimated results of future operations 
changes in the business plan or operating results that are different than the estimates used to develop the valuation of the assets may impact their valuation 
we have tested our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year presented 
based on the company s most recent evaluations  the fair values of each of the company s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values 
the company recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to one of its tradenames 
there have been no other impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal deferred sales 
deferred sales primarily consists of the liability pertaining to our frequent buyer program 
our frequent buyer program allows customers to earn points toward free merchandise based on the volume of purchases 
points are earned each year under our frequent buyer program and are redeemable within the first three months of the following year or they expire 
we defer sales as points are earned  based on historical redemption data as well as marketing data within the current period  and record a liability for points earned based on the value of points that are expected to be redeemed 
net increases to deferred sales were million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the balance for the deferred sales liability was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation 
we account for our stock based compensation based on fair value recognition requirements  as defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of awards and is recognized as expense over the vesting period  net of anticipated forfeitures 
with the exception of restricted shares and restricted share units  determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free rate 
the expected volatility is derived from the average volatility of similar actively traded companies over our expected holding periods  as well as the company s own volatility  which is weighted to adjust for the shorter trading history 
generally  the expected holding period of non performance based options is calculated using the simplified method using the vesting term of years and the contractual term of years  resulting in a holding period of years 
certain limited grants have contractual terms of years  and or shorter vesting periods and as such have calculated holding periods of to years 
our performance based stock option grants generally vest annually over four years depending on a particular year s attainment of certain internal 
table of contents financial performance metrics 
for accounting purposes  performance based stock option grants are measured  and expense is calculated and recorded  subsequent to the determination that the achievement of the pre established performance targets are probable  over the relevant service period 
the target metrics underlying the vesting of performance based stock option grants are established each year 
the vesting requirements for performance based stock option grants permit a catch up of vesting should the target not be achieved in a fiscal year but achieved in a subsequent fiscal year  over the four year vesting period 
accordingly  the holding period for performance based stock option grants is calculated using the vesting term of year and the remainder of the contractual term of years  depending on which year of the four year grant is currently vesting  eg of the grant vesting in year two of the grant would have a holding period calculated using year and the remaining years of the contractual term 
the simplified method was chosen as a means to determine the company s holding period as prior to november there was no historical option exercise experience due to the company being privately held 
as of december   there continues to be insufficient information for purposes of determining a company specific holding period due to the company being a relatively new publicly owned company 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the average yields of zero coupon us treasury strips for the expected holding period of each of the company s stock option grants 
compensation expense resulting from the granting of restricted shares and restricted share units is based on the grant date fair value of those common shares and is recognized generally over the two to four year vesting period for restricted shares and over the one year vesting period for restricted share units 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
similar to stock options  our employee stock purchase plan espp is accounted for based on fair value recognition requirements 
espp participation occurs each calendar quarter the participation period and the expense of which is subject to employee participation in the plan 
under the espp  participating employees are allowed to purchase shares at of the lower of the market price of the company s common stock at either the first or last trading day of the participation period 
compensation expense related to the espp is based on the estimated fair value of the discount and purchase price offered on the estimated shares to be purchased under the espp 
expense is calculated quarterly  based on the employee contributions made over the three month participation period  using volatility and risk free rates applicable to that three month period 
amounts charged to expense were million  million and million for stock based compensation for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was   and  respectively 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
when assessing the need for valuation allowances  we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets in future years  we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs  along with a corresponding increase or charge to income 
we account for our tax positions based on the provisions of the accounting literature related to accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
such literature provides guidance for the recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for tax positions that are not more likely than not sustainable upon audit  we recognize the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained 
we make estimates of the potential liability based on our assessment of all potential tax exposures 
in addition  we use factors such as applicable tax laws and regulations  current information and past experience with similar issues to make these adjustments 
the tax positions are analyzed regularly and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments for those positions 
we record interest expense and penalties payable to relevant tax authorities as income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information on income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates if there were outstanding indebtedness  however  the company had no outstanding debt as of december  market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of market risk sensitive instruments caused by fluctuations in interest rates and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in the results of our operations and cash flows 
other than on our notes  which carried a floating interest rate  we have not used derivative financial instruments in connection with such market risks 
our revolving credit facility carries a floating interest rate that is tied to the adjusted eurodollar rate and the prime rate and  therefore  our statements of operations and our cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   there were no borrowings on our revolving credit facility
