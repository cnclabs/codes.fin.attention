this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including certain risks inherent with our business as discussed in item a risk factors 
the following discussion starts with an overview of our business and our financial results followed by a discussion of material trends and uncertainties 
next we provide an overview of our revenues and costs followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
finally we provide an analysis of the results of our operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources 
business overview primoris is a holding company of various subsidiaries  which form one of the largest publicly traded specialty contractors and infrastructure companies in the united states 
serving diverse end markets  primoris provides a wide range of construction  fabrication  maintenance  replacement  water and wastewater  and engineering services to major public utilities  petrochemical companies  energy companies  municipalities  state departments of transportation and other customers

based outside of houston  texas  silva provides transportation infrastructure maintenance  asphalt paving  and material sales in the gulf coast region of the united states 
following this acquisition  silva was merged with the operations of jcg 
on september   we purchased certain assets of the saxon group  inc saxon 
based in suwannee  georgia  outside atlanta  saxon is a full service industrial construction enterprise with special expertise in the industrial gas processing and power plant sectors 
on november   we purchased all of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of qc contracting  inc  a privately held minnesota corporation qc 
the sellers elected to treat the acquisition as an asset purchase under section h of the internal revenue code 
based in little canada  minnesota  north of st 
paul  minnesota  qc specializes in small diameter pipeline and gas distribution construction  restoration and other services  primarily in the upper midwest region of the united states 
the company segregates the business into three operating segments the east construction services segment  the west construction services segment and the engineering segment 
range of services east and west construction services both the east construction services and the west construction services segments specialize in a range of services that include designing  building installing  replacing  repairing rehabilitating and providing management services for construction related projects 
our services include providing installation of underground pipeline  cable and conduits for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation and maintenance of industrial facilities for entities in the petroleum  petrochemical and water industries  providing installation of complex commercial and industrial cast in place structures  and providing construction of highways and industrial and environmental construction 

table of contents east construction services the east construction services segment consists of business located primarily in the southeastern united states and along the gulf coast 
the segment includes the jcg heavy civil  industrial and infrastructure and maintenance operations headquartered in baton rouge  louisiana  water and wastewater construction operations of cardinal contractors  inc located in sarasota  florida  and the operations of sprint  silva and saxon 
west construction services the west construction services segment consists of businesses located primarily in the western united states 
the segment includes the underground and industrial operations of arb  inc  headquartered in lake forest  california  the operations of rockford  which while headquartered in hillsboro  oregon  performs its major capital underground work throughout the united states  the operations of arb structures  inc  alaska continental pipeline  inc  all day electric company  inc owned in and in prior years  stellaris  llc  primoris renewables  inc and juniper rock  inc 
the segment also includes the operations of the blythe power constructors joint venture and q contracting  inc engineering the engineering segment includes the results of onquest  inc and born heaters canada  ulc 
the engineering group specializes in designing  supplying  and installing high performance furnaces  heaters  burner management systems  and related combustion and process technologies for clients in the oil refining  petrochemical  and power generation industries 
it furnishes turnkey project management with technical expertise and the ability to deliver custom engineering solutions worldwide 
material trends and uncertainties we generate our revenue from both large and small construction and engineering projects 
the award of these contracts is dependent on a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
business in the construction industry is cyclical 
we depend in part on spending by companies in the energy and oil and gas industries  the gas utility industry  as well as municipal water and wastewater customers 
over the past several years  each segment has benefited from demand for more efficient and more environmentally friendly energy and power facilities  local highway and bridge needs and from the strength of the oil and gas industry  however  each of these industries and the government agencies periodically are adversely affected by macroeconomic conditions 
economic factors outside of our control may affect the amount and size of contracts we are awarded in any particular period 
we and our customers are operating in a challenging business environment in light of the economic downturn and uncertain capital markets 
we are closely monitoring our customers and the effect that changes in economic  market and regulatory conditions may have on them 
we have experienced reduced spending by some of our customers over the last several years  which we attribute to negative economic and market conditions  and we anticipate that these negative conditions may continue to affect demand for our services in the near term 
fluctuations in market prices  both oil  gas and other fuel sources can affect demand for our services 
however  we believe that most of our customers  some of whom are regulated utilities  remain financially stable in general and will be able to continue with their business plans over the long term period 
seasonality and cyclicality primoris results of operations are subject to quarterly variations 
some of the variation is the result of weather  particularly rain and snow  which can impact primoris ability to perform construction services 
while the majority of the company s work is in the southern half of the united states  these seasonal impacts affect revenues and profitability since gas and other utilities defer routine replacement and repair during their period of peak demand 
in addition  demand for new projects tends to be lower during the early part of the year due to clients internal budget cycles 
as a result  the company usually experiences higher revenues and earnings in the third and fourth quarters of the year as compared to the first two quarters 
the company is also dependent on large construction projects which tend not to be seasonal  but can fluctuate from year to year based on general economic conditions 
because of the cyclical nature of its business  the financial results for any period may fluctuate from prior periods  and the company s financial condition and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter 
results from one quarter may not be indicative of its financial condition or operating results for any other quarter or for an entire year 

table of contents outlook we believe that we have market opportunities in in the following areas construction of petroleum and natural gas and natural gas liquid pipelines we expect that production from the shale formations will continue to increase and that the current disconnect between production and processing locations provides opportunities for our underground construction operations  primarily rockford and sprint 
inspection and replacement of utility infrastructure we expect that continuing safety enhancements to the gas utility infrastructure will provide opportunities for our arb underground operations 
we also expect that ongoing gas utility repair and maintenance opportunities will benefit qc and sprint 
construction of natural gas fired power plants and heavy industrial plants we expect continued construction opportunities for both base load and peaker power plants 
in addition  the current low price of natural gas could result in the conversion of coal fired power plants and conversion and expansion at chemical plants and industrial facilities 
these opportunities would benefit our arb industrial group  jcg industrial group and saxon 
construction of alternative energy facilities we anticipate continued construction opportunities as state governments remain committed to renewable power standards  primarily benefitting arb industrial 
transportation infrastructure construction opportunities we believe that this market has seen a decrease in new contract opportunities in most of the united states  including in the louisiana market 
however  we expect a potential increase in texas  as the budget for highway construction  reconstruction and system maintenance is expected to increase by over the budget 
the transportation market would primarily impact the operations of jcg 
please note that our outlook and financial results could be adversely impacted by the factors discussed in item a risk factors in this annual report on form k 
this outlook consists of forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and also affect the amounts of revenues and expenses reported for each period 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available  is dependent on future events  or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
often  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates may be used in our assessments of revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting  the allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities and deferred income taxes 
actual results could differ from those that result from using the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we periodically review these accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition historically  substantial portions of the company s revenues have been generated under fixed price contracts 
fixed price contracts carry certain inherent risks  including underestimation of costs  problems with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur over the contract period 
the company recognizes revenues using the percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts  which may result in uneven and irregular results 
unforeseen events and circumstances can alter the estimate of the costs and potential profit associated with a particular contract 
to the extent that original cost estimates are modified  estimated costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed  or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  cash flow  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected 
revenue is recognized on the cost to total cost percentage of completion method for fixed price contracts 
in the percentage of completion method  estimated revenues and resulting contract income is calculated based on the total costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract revenues and income  can be impacted by changes in any of the following productivity  scheduling  the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing permits and approvals  labor availability  governmental regulation and politics may affect the progress of a project s completion and thus the timing of revenue recognition 
if an estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full at the time of the estimate 

table of contents other contract forms in addition  the company also uses unit price  time and material  and cost reimbursable plus fee contracts 
for these jobs  revenue is recognized based on contractual terms 
for example  time and material contract revenues are recognized based on purchasing and employee time records 
similarly  unit price contracts recognize revenue based on accomplishment of specific units at a specified unit price 
for all of its contracts  the company includes the provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts in accrued expenses 
the provision for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income 
these revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
claims are included in revenues when realization is probable and amounts can be reliably determined 
revenues in excess of contract costs incurred on claims are recognized only when the amounts have been paid 
the caption costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents unbilled receivables which arise when revenues have been recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date 
balances may represent a unbilled amounts arising from the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting  b incurred costs to be billed under cost reimbursement type contracts  or c amounts arising from routine lags in billing 
for those contracts in which billings exceed contract revenues recognized to date  excesses are included in the caption billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings 
the company considers unapproved change orders to be contract variations for which primoris has customer approval for a scope change but a price change associated with the scope change has not yet been agreed upon 
costs associated with unapproved change orders are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs as incurred 
the company recognizes revenue equal to costs incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated revenue amount is equal to or greater than the costs related to the unapproved change order 
unapproved change orders involve the use of estimates  and it is reasonably possible that revisions to the estimated costs and recoverable amounts may be required in future reporting periods to reflect changes in estimates or final agreements with customers 
the company considers claims to be amounts primoris seeks  or will seek  to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are treated as project costs when incurred 
in accordance with applicable terms of construction contracts  certain retainage amounts may be withheld by customers until completion and acceptance of the project 
final payments of the majority of retainage may not be made until the following operating cycle 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method as set forth in asc topic income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  in the judgment of our management  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available evidence  including recent financial operations  projected future taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  tax planning strategies  and the length of tax asset carryforward periods 
the realization of deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain jurisdictions 
if we subsequently determine that the carrying value of these assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained based on its technical merits in a tax examination  using the presumption the tax authority has fully knowledge of all relevant facts regarding the position 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax position not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 

table of contents valuation of acquired businesses we use the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to account for the purchase price of businesses 
the determination of fair value requires estimates and judgments of future cash flow expectations for the assignment of the fair values to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
identifiable tangible assets 
significant identifiable tangible assets acquired would include accounts receivable  costs and earnings in excess of billings for projects  inventory and fixed assets  generally consisting of construction equipment  for each acquisition 
we determine the fair value of these assets on the acquisition date 
for current assets and current liabilities of an acquisition  the company will evaluate whether the book value is equivalent to fair value due to their short term nature 
we estimate the fair value of fixed assets using a market approach  based on comparable market values for similar equipment of similar condition and age 
identifiable intangible assets 
when necessary  we use the assistance of an independent third party valuation specialist to determine the fair value of the intangible assets acquired for the acquisitions 
a liability for contingent consideration based on future earnings is estimated at it s fair value at the date of acquisition  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded in earnings as a gain or loss 
fair value is estimated as of the acquisition date using estimated earnout payments based on management s best estimate 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap provides a measurement period of up to one year in which to finalize all fair value estimates associated with the acquisition of a business 
most estimates are preliminary until the end of the measurement period 
during the measurement period  adjustments to initial valuations and estimates that reflect newly discovered information that existed at the acquisition date are recorded 
after the measurement date  any adjustments would be recorded as a current period gain or loss 
goodwill goodwill is assessed for impairment annually and more frequently if triggering events occur 
in performing these assessments  management relies on various factors  including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable transactions and other market data 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill for impairment 
since judgment is involved in performing fair value measurements used in goodwill impairment analyses  there is risk that the carrying values of our goodwill may not be properly stated 
we account for goodwill  including evaluation of any goodwill impairment under asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  performed at the reporting unit level for those units with recorded goodwill on october of each year  unless there are indications requiring a more frequent impairment test 
to date  goodwill has arisen from acquisitions and is recorded at our reporting units as follows james construction group  east construction services segment   rockford  west construction services segment  qc contracting  inc  west construction services segment   sprint a subsidiary of primoris energy services corporation pes  east construction services segment   born canada  engineering segment   the saxon group a subsidiary of pes  east construction services segment   and cardinal contractors  east construction services segment  using the two step impairment test  the company tests for goodwill impairment on october each year 
first  we compare the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount 
fair value for the goodwill impairment test is determined utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgets discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year cash flows 
other valuation methods may be used to corroborate the discounted cash flow method 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and further tests are performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compare the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination is determined 
we allocate the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  including intangible assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
disruptions to our business  such as end market conditions  protracted economic weakness  unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units and the divestiture of a significant component of a reporting unit may result in our having to perform a goodwill impairment first step valuation analysis for some or all of our reporting units prior to the required annual assessment 
these types of events and the resulting analysis could result in goodwill impairment charges in any periods in the future 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill or impairment asu 
asu provides an option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that the fair value is not less than its carrying amount  then it is not necessary to perform the two step impairment test 
an entity can choose to perform the qualitative assessment on non  some or all of its reporting units 
an entity can also bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to step one of the impairment test  and then resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period 
asu also includes new qualitative indicators that replace those currently used to determine whether an interim goodwill impairment test is required to be performed 
the company adopted this standard on january   which did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment asu 
asu allows an organization the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative impairment test of the indefinite lived intangible asset is necessary 
if the qualitative assessment reveals that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired  a calculation of the asset s fair value is required 
otherwise  no quantitative calculation  as outlined in subtopic is necessary 
the company adopted this standard on october   the date of the company s impairment review 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
long lived assets assets held and used by the company  primarily property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
we perform an undiscounted operation cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment for assets held for use  we group assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which cash flows are separately identified 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
the calculation of the fair value of long lived assets is based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates  reflecting varying degrees of perceived risk 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value and useful lives of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 
reserve for uninsured risks estimates are inherent in the assessment of our exposure to uninsured risks 
significant judgments by us and where possible  third party experts are needed in determining probable and or reasonably estimable amounts that should be recorded or disclosed in the financial statements 
the results of any changes in accounting estimates are reflected in the financial statements of the period in which we determine we need to record a change 
we self insure worker s compensation claims up to  per claim 
we maintained a self insurance reserve totaling approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  claims administration expenses were charged to current operations as incurred 
our accruals are based on judgment  the probability of losses  and where applicable  the consideration of opinions of internal and or external legal counsel 
the amount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our balance sheets 
actual payments that may be made in the future could materially differ from such reserves 
litigation and contingencies litigation and contingencies are included in our consolidated financial statements based on our assessment of the expected outcome of litigation proceedings or the expected resolution of the contingency 
we may not be able to ascertain the ultimate outcome of the litigation or contingencies  but after a review and consultation with counsel and taking into consideration relevant insurance coverage and related deductibles  we accrue a liability for an estimated loss if the potential loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to make these estimates and due to uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the information available at that time 
as additional information becomes available  we may revise our estimates 
these revisions could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition

much of that work was done in the far east and australia 
segment results the following discussion describes the significant factors contributing to the results of our three operating segments 
east construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the east construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue east construction services revenue gross profit and east construction services segment revenue in increased by million  or  from of the revenue increase  million was due to the contribution of the three acquired companies  sprint  silva and saxon 
jcg revenues increased by million compared to  as revenue increased at our industrial  infrastructure and maintenance and deep tunneling divisions 
revenues at the heavy civil division were impacted by a decrease of million in work for ladot and was offset by increases in work for txdot 
gross profit increased by million  or  compared to gross profit contribution from the acquisitions was million 
jcg gross profit decreased by million with increases at the industrial  infrastructure and maintenance and deep tunneling divisions partially offsetting a million decrease at the heavy civil division 
the heavy civil division decrease was primarily attributable to the reduction in ladot revenues and the lower profit margins associated with the startup projects in belton  texas area 
over time  we expect the texas gross profit to increase to historical heavy civil levels 
the reduction of gross profit percentage from of revenues to of revenues was primarily as a result of the reduced revenues and gross profit for the jcg heavy civil division 

table of contents and east construction services segment revenue in increased by million  or  from the revenue increases occurred primarily in the jcg heavy civil group where revenue increased by million from continued work on large highway construction projects for state agencies in louisiana and texas compared to this increase was offset by a reduction of million in the jcg industrial group attributable to temporary slowdowns in construction activity within the petrochemical sector along the gulf coast 
gross profit increased by million  or  in compared to the increase resulted from increased gross profit contributed by the jcg heavy civil group of million primarily resulting from improved efficiency on a large causeway project in south louisiana 
west construction services segment revenue and gross profit for the west construction services segment for the years ending december   and were as follows thousands of revenue thousands of revenue thousands of revenue west construction services revenue gross profit and west construction services segment revenues decreased by million  or for compared to primarily due to a decline in revenue at rockford from the completion of the ruby project in the decline in revenues was partially offset by revenue increases as follows at arb underground division of million  arb industrial division of million and rockford excluding ruby of million 
in addition  the blythe power constructors joint ventures contributed revenues million and the acquisition of qc added million 
revenues for the west construction services segment s largest customer increased to million from million for the previous year 
gross profit for the west construction services increased by million  or  for compared to the small increase was primarily the result of a combination of a reduction due to the completion of the ruby project and the long beach airport parking facility  totaling million  offset by increases in gross profit as follows arb s underground division of million  arb s industrial division of million  rockford excluding ruby of million  blythe power constructors of million and qc of million 
the gross profit at arb s industrial division primarily reflects final completion of two power projects  while the arb underground division reflects primarily the increased gross profit from its largest customer 
gross profit as a percent of revenues increased to in compared to in primarily as a result of increases in revenues and gross profit at the two arb divisions in  compared to and west construction services segment revenues increased by million  or  for compared to primarily due to the million revenue increase contributed by the november rockford acquisition 
additionally  revenues increased in by million from california pipeline projects  million from cable and conduit projects  and million from industrial power plant projects 
gross profit for the west construction services increased by million  or  for compared to rockford contributed increased gross profit of million  pipeline projects increased by million  cable and conduit work increased by million and parking structures increased by million
