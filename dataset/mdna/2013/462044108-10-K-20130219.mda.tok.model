table of contents executive summary our business we are a technology focused seismic solutions company that provides planning and seismic processing services  software and advanced acquisition equipment to the global energy industry 
our services  technologies and products are used by oil and gas exploration and production e p companies and seismic acquisition contractors to generate high resolution images of the earth s subsurface during exploration  exploitation  and production operations 
our services and products are intended to measure and interpret seismic data about rock and fluid properties within the earth s subsurface to enable oil and gas companies to make improved drilling and production decisions 
we acquire and process seismic data from seismic surveys in regional data programs  which then become part of our seismic data library 
the seismic surveys for our data library business are pre funded  or underwritten  in part by our customers  and we contract with third party seismic data acquisition companies to shoot and acquire the seismic data  all of which is intended to minimize our risk exposure 
we serve customers in all major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices in cities on five continents 
in  we formed a joint venture with bgp  inc  china national petroleum corporation bgp  a subsidiary of china national petroleum corporation  and contributed most of our land seismic equipment businesses to inova geophysical equipment limited inova geophysical  the joint venture entity 
in a related transaction  we issued to bgp million shares of our common stock  which represents approximately of our outstanding shares at december  bgp is generally regarded as the world s largest land geophysical service contractor 
bgp owns a interest in inova geophysical and we own a interest 
our services and products include the following seismic data processing and reservoir imaging services  seismic data libraries  planning services for survey design and optimization  navigation  command control  and data management software products  marine seismic data acquisition equipment  and land seismic data acquisition equipment principally through our ownership in inova geophysical 
we operate our company through three business segments solutions  systems  and software  and through our inova geophysical joint venture 
solutions advanced seismic data processing services for marine and land environments  reservoir solutions  onboard processing and quality control  seismic data libraries  and services by our geoventures services group 
systems towed streamer and redeployable ocean bottom cable seismic data acquisition systems and shipboard recorders  streamer positioning and control systems  energy sources and analog geophone sensors 
software software systems and related services for navigation and data management involving towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
inova geophysical through our interest in inova geophysical  cable based  cableless and radio controlled seismic data acquisition systems  digital sensors  vibroseis vehicles ie vibrator trucks and source controllers for detonator and energy sources business lines 
economic conditions demand for our seismic data acquisition services and products has traditionally been cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness and ability to expend their capital for oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
this demand is sensitive to current and expected future crude oil and natural gas prices 
during  wti spot crude oil prices rose to approximately per barrel in the first quarter  declined to just below per barrel near the end of the second quarter  and then steadily increased to nearly per barrel near the end of the third quarter 
during the fourth quarter of  wti spot crude oil prices traded in a narrower range of to per barrel  finishing the year near per barrel 
brent crude oil prices followed a similar pattern to wti  initially rising to approximately per barrel in the first quarter  followed by a steady decline to per barrel by the end of the second quarter  then steadily rising to approximately per barrel late in the third quarter  it traded in a narrower range during s fourth quarter of to per barrel  finishing the year near per barrel 

table of contents energy price forecasts are by their nature highly uncertain  but external reports indicate that wti crude oil prices and brent crude oil prices are expected to remain in price ranges of to and to per barrel  respectively  for as demand outpaces supply 
us natural gas prices appeared to reverse their downward trend in us henry hub natural gas prices decreased to approximately per mmbtu in april  but during the third quarter  natural gas prices traded in a range from to per mmbtu  and during the fourth quarter in a higher range of to 
while it may be too early to tell if this change in price direction is in fact a trend reversal  demand for natural gas has not deteriorated 
we believe demand for natural gas will continue to grow and that industry investment in shale based gas production will increase and be facilitated by new investment in technologies to locate and extract the reserves 
for  our solutions segment revenues increased over results  due to improved data processing revenues and higher sales by our geoventures business 
during  our participation in oil and gas shale plays continued to expand  with the completion of our second land multi client new venture project in the marcellus shale area  and with four other projects underway  including a land project in poland 
in the process  we are increasing our technical understanding of both oil and gas shale plays and we intend to leverage this expertise to broaden our oil and gas shale footprint geographically in both the us and international markets 
in addition  customer demand remains high for seismic data acquired by our geoventures business in offshore areas around the globe where e p companies have demonstrated a strong interest for exploration  including frontier basins offshore latin america  africa  and in the arctic  as well as resscan land programs in north america 
at december   our solutions segment backlog  which consists of commitments for i data processing work and ii both multi client new venture and proprietary projects by our geoventures group that have been underwritten  was million compared with million at december   an increase of 
we anticipate that the majority of this backlog will be recognized as revenue over the first half of revenues for our systems segment decreased in compared to while this segment benefited from healthy marine repair and replacement sales and improved ocean bottom cable sales  we experienced soft streamer positioning sales in  primarily attributable to modest capital spending by our contractor customers 
this reduced level of spending was principally related to a lower number of new vessels on which our systems equipment and software are often installed introduced in  compared to the number of new vessels introduced in in  we also recognized revenue from the sale to bgp of a digistreamer twelve streamer system  there was no similar sale of that magnitude in in january  cggveritas closed its acquisition of fugro s geoscience division  further consolidating the marine towed streamer industry market segment  which could lead to a reduction in the number of our potential customers and vessel outfitting opportunities 
our software segment revenues increased in compared to due to steady subscription sales of orca and gator software 
our land seismic business  particularly inova geophysical s business in north america and russia  continues to show progress  reporting a sizable increase in revenues and gross profits for the twelve month period from october  to september   compared to the twelve month period ended september  with the recent launches of its lower cost cableless hawk land system  an improved firefly system firefly dr and a new cabled system gi  inova has positive momentum heading into the next twelve month period 
it is our view that technologies that add a competitive advantage through improved imaging  cost reductions or improvements in well productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace 
we believe that our newest technologies such as digifin  digistreamer  orca  our wiband data processing technology and inova geophysical s newest technologies including firefly dr  hawk sn  univib  a new vectorseis ml digital sensor  upgrades to its aries ii product with digital sensor capabilities and its new gi cabled system  will continue to attract customer interest  because those technologies are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
we expect the growth in demand for seismic services to continue to remain positive for the foreseeable future  and we remain positioned to achieve year over year improvement in both our revenue and profitability for as compared to however  in stating these expectations  we are assuming that i the global and us economies will not slip back into a recession  ii the prices of wti and brent crude oil will remain predominantly above and per barrel  respectively  iii the level of exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico will continue to increase  and iv there will be increasing demand for seismic services in the middle east and north africa resulting from improved geopolitical stability in those areas 
westerngeco legal proceedings the trial in this lawsuit began on july  a verdict was returned by the jury on august   finding that we willfully infringed the claims contained in four patents and awarding westerngeco the sum of million in damages  consisting of million in reasonable royalty and million in lost profits 
we believe that the verdict is not consistent with applicable law or the facts or evidence in the case and  on september   filed motions with the trial court to overturn all or portions of the verdict 
see further discussion at part i  item legal proceedings 

table of contents the ultimate outcome of the case in the trial court  and the content of the final judgment as a whole  presently rest with the presiding trial court judge 
the next step in the case is for the trial court judge to decide post verdict motions filed by the parties and enter a judgment 
the final judgment will determine the result of the trial prior to appeal 
when he enters a judgment in the case  the judge can choose to follow the jury verdict or to take other actions  such as changing to a different result or ordering an entirely new trial 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  the court had not yet entered a judgment in the case 
if the court enters a judgment that is adverse to us  we intend to appeal the judgment to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
westerngeco would also have the right to elect to appeal any final judgment

table of contents net revenues  gross profits and gross margins solutions net revenues for increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for this increase was predominantly driven by improved data processing revenues due to post macondo recovery in the gulf of mexico and continued international expansion  higher geoventures revenue related to growth in new venture activity  including programs offshore latin america  africa  and in the arctic  as well as resscan land programs in north america  and growth in data library sales related to programs offshore latin america  africa  australia and in the arctic 
gross profit increased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  or a gross margin  for  primarily attributable to the recovery and expansion of our data processing business during and a more profitable mix of programs in geoventures 
systems net revenues for decreased by million  or  to million  compared to million for this decrease was driven primarily by lower volumes of towed marine streamer positioning equipment  and was offset by improved ocean bottom cable sales 
in  we recognized revenue from the sale to bgp of a digistreamer twelve streamer system  which was not replicated in gross profit for decreased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  representing a gross margin  for the decrease in gross margins in our systems segment was primarily due to reduced sales of towed marine streamer positioning equipment 
software net revenues for increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for excluding the effects of foreign currency translation  revenues increased due to continued demand for the orca and gator software platforms 
gross profit for increased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  for  which represented a gross margin 
gross profit increased in line with revenue while gross margins increased only slightly from to gross margins remained high due to significantly higher software sales  which carry a much higher gross margin than other products and services

the change in our effective tax rate between and was due to a reduction in the valuation allowance on us federal net deferred tax assets  partially offset by changes in the distribution of earnings between us and foreign jurisdictions 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance for a portion of our us federal net deferred tax assets that relate to capital losses and basis differences that will create capital losses 
preferred stock dividends the preferred stock dividend relates to our series d preferred stock

during  we recorded income from operations of million compared to million for  as adjusted 
net revenues  gross profits and gross margins as adjusted  excluding legacy land systems results for solutions net revenues for decreased by million  to million  compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to lower data processing revenues as our data processing business was negatively impacted by the lagging effects of the slowdown in the gulf of mexico 
this decrease was partially offset by increased demand for access to our multi client new venture projects and licensing of data libraries in greenland  east africa and in north american shale plays  although overall data library sales were down 
gross profit decreased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  or a gross margin  for  primarily attributable to lower data processing revenues 
systems net revenues for increased by million to million  compared to million for this increase was driven primarily by higher sales of towed streamer and other marine products  including revenue recognized from the sale to bgp of a digistreamer twelve streamer system 
gross profit for increased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  representing a gross margin  for the decrease in gross margins in our systems segment was primarily due to changes in product mix  with the large digistreamer system sale having a lower margin relative to our other marine streamer products  such as our streamer positioning equipment 
software net revenues for increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for the increase in revenues as expressed in us dollars was principally due to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
expressed in british pounds sterling the local currency  net revenues were flat 
gross profit increased by million to million compared to million for  while gross margins increased by to due to changes in product mix there was a relative increase in software sales during  which have higher margins than the associated hardware sales in this segment 
operating expenses as adjusted  excluding legacy land systems results for research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expense was million  or of net revenues  for  an increase of million compared to million  or of net revenues  for  as adjusted 
this increase in research and development expense was due to increased investment by our systems segment to develop our next generation marine technologies 
we continue to strategically invest in our next generation of seismic data acquisition services and products  particularly in shale formation technologies and marine platforms  and we expect this investment will continue in the future 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expense of million  or of net revenues  for increased million compared to million  or of net revenues  for  as adjusted 
this increase in marketing and sales expense was due to higher advertising and employment related expenses 
we intend to continue investing significant sums in our marketing efforts as we seek to penetrate markets with our latest services and products 
general  administrative and other operating expenses general  administrative and other operating expenses of million for decreased million compared to million  for the corresponding period of  as adjusted 
general  administrative and other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues for and were and  respectively 
this decrease in expense was due to lower legal costs  and lower stock based compensation and employment related expenses 
this decrease was partially offset by million of severance charges primarily related to the restructuring of geophone operations in the netherlands as we moved our geophone manufacturing operations to lower cost centers in asia 
non operating items interest expense  net interest expense  net  of million for decreased million compared to million for our interest expense in included accretion costs of approximately million of non cash debt discount fully amortized in the first quarter of associated with two promissory notes payable to our senior credit bank lender  bank of china  new york branch  that we had signed and delivered to the bank in october  and a write off of million of deferred financing charges related to our debt refinancing transactions during the first quarter of after excluding these two non cash items  our interest expense  net  was million for the year 
as a result of our march debt refinancing transactions  our interest expense was significantly lower in than we experienced in equity in losses of inova geophysical we account for our interest in inova geophysical as an equity method investment and record our share of earnings of inova geophysical on a one fiscal quarter lag basis

liquidity and capital resources sources of capital our cash requirements include our working capital requirements  cash required for our debt service payments  multi client seismic data acquisition activities and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had working capital of million  which included million of cash on hand 
working capital requirements are primarily driven by our continued investment in our multi client seismic data library million in and  to a lesser extent  our inventory purchase obligations 
at december   our outstanding inventory purchase obligations were million 
also  our headcount has traditionally been a significant driver of our working capital needs 
because a significant portion of our business is involved in the planning  processing and interpretation of seismic data services  one of our largest investments is in our employees  which involves cash expenditures for their salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and related compensation expenses 
our working capital requirements may change from time to time depending upon many factors  including our operating results and adjustments in our operating plan required in response to industry conditions  competition  acquisition opportunities and unexpected events  such as an adverse judgment in our westerngeco litigation  which is further discussed at part i  item legal proceedings 
in recent years  our primary sources of funds have been cash flows generated from our operations  our existing cash balances  debt and equity issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
at december   our principal outstanding credit facility consisted of a revolving line of credit providing for borrowings of up to million  which million was outstanding as of that date  leaving million of unused and available capacity 
revolving line of credit on may   we amended the terms of our senior secured credit facility the credit facility with china merchants bank co  ltd  new york branch  as administrative agent and lender cmb 
the first 
table of contents amendment to credit agreement and loan documents the first amendment modified certain provisions of our senior credit agreement with cmb that we had entered into in march as amended by the first amendment  the credit facility now provides that we may make revolving credit borrowings in us dollars  euros  british pounds sterling or canadian dollars up to an amount not to exceed the us dollar equivalent of million 
in addition  all then outstanding term loan indebtedness under the credit facility was converted to revolving credit indebtedness  such that as of may   there was million in total revolving credit indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility 
for further information on our credit facility  see note long term debt  lease obligations and interest rate caps at notes to consolidated financial statements 
meeting our liquidity requirements we have historically financed our operations from internally generated cash  funds from equity and debt financings  and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
as of december   our total outstanding indebtedness including capital lease obligations was approximately million  consisting of approximately million outstanding under our revolving line of credit  million relating to our facility lease obligations and million of capital leases 
as of december   we had million undrawn and available on our revolving line of credit under our credit facility  and had approximately million of cash on hand 
for  total capital expenditures  including investments in our multi client data library  were million  and we are projecting capital expenditures for to be between million to million 
of the total projected capital expenditures  we are estimating that approximately million to million will be spent on investments in our multi client data library 
we currently believe that our existing cash  cash generated from operations and our sources of working capital will be sufficient for us to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
however  as further described in part i  item legal proceedings  there are possible scenarios involving a judgment to be rendered in the westerngeco lawsuit that would adversely affect our liquidity 
if we become subject to a significant adverse judgment in the westerngeco lawsuit  we might have to utilize a combination of cash on hand  undrawn balances available under our revolving line of credit under our senior debt facility and possibly incur additional debt and or equity financing 
cash flow from operations net cash provided by operating activities was million for  compared to million for the increase in our cash flows from operations was due in part to the increase in our income from operations for compared to also positively impacting our cash flows was an increase in accrued expenses related to our geoventures projects 
this is partially offset by an increase in unbilled revenues related to geoventures 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for  which was comparable to the million of net cash provided by operating activities in similar to  our increase in sales activity during the fourth quarter of  resulted in an increase in our accounts receivable and then had a positive impact to our cash balances in the first quarter of  as we converted our receivables into cash 
cash flow from investing activities net cash flow used in investing activities was million for  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the principal uses of cash in our investing activities during were million of continued investments in our multi client data library and million in investments in property  plant and equipment 
these uses of cash were offset by the cash provided by the maturity of million in short term bank certificates of deposit 
net cash flow used in investing activities was million for  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the principal uses of cash in our investing activities during were million of continued investments in our multi client data library  our net investment of million of excess cash in short term bank certificates of deposit  our million investment in property  plant and equipment and our million investment in a convertible note 
cash flow from financing activities net cash flow used in financing activities was million for  compared to million of net cash flow provided by financing activities for the net cash flow used in financing activities during was primarily related to repayment of our term loan of million  offset by net borrowings under our amended revolving line of credit of million 
we also paid million in cash dividends on our outstanding series d preferred stock in net cash flow provided by financing activities was million for  compared to million of net cash flow used in financing activities for the net cash flow provided by financing activities during was primarily related to 
table of contents proceeds from stock option exercises of million and an excess tax benefit from stock based compensation of million 
this cash inflow was partially offset by payments on our long term debt of million 
we also paid million in cash dividends on our outstanding series d preferred stock in inflation and seasonality inflation in recent years has not had a material effect on our costs of goods or labor  or the prices for our products or services 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand typically in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
we experienced increased demand in the fourth quarters of both and driven by increased capital expenditures from our e p customers  consistent with our historical seasonality 
future contractual obligations the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations  as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt interest on long term debt obligations equipment capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total the long term debt and lease obligations at december  included million under our term loan scheduled to mature in and million of indebtedness related to our stafford  texas facility sale leaseback arrangement 
the million of capital lease obligations relates to gxt s financing of computer and other equipment purchases 
the operating lease commitments at december  relate to our leases for certain equipment  offices  processing centers  and warehouse space under non cancelable operating leases 
our purchase obligations primarily relate to our committed inventory purchase orders under which deliveries of inventory are scheduled to be made in critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of i multi client and proprietary surveys  licenses of on the shelf data libraries and imaging services  within our solutions segment  ii seismic data acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our systems segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our software segment 
multi client and proprietary surveys  data libraries and imaging services as our multi client surveys are being designed  acquired or processed referred to as the new venture phase  we enter into non exclusive licensing arrangements with our customers 
license revenues from these new venture survey projects are recognized during the new venture phase as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the seismic survey is considered on the shelf  and licenses to the survey data are granted to customers on a non exclusive basis 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  b the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  c delivery or performance has occurred  and d no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have 
table of contents provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
we also perform seismic surveys under contracts to specific customers  whereby the seismic data is owned by those customers 
we recognize revenue as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
we use quantifiable measures of progress consistent with our multi client surveys 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
acquisition systems and other seismic equipment for the sales of seismic data acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of asc revenue recognition and recognize revenue when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the acquisition system or other seismic equipment is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the case in which a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained software for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements for these transactions of asc software revenue recognition asc 
we recognize revenue from sales of these software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case in which a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the element or  if vsoe is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we offer time based software licenses 
for time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to five years 
multiple element arrangements when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of asc accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement asc 
we adopted this guidance as of january   and applied the guidance to transactions initiated or materially modified on or after january  the guidance does not apply to software sales accounted for under asc we also adopted  in the same period  guidance within asc that excludes from its scope revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements  such that the tangible products contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
this guidance requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable qualifying as a separate unit of accounting in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise  third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
vsoe is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar product is sold on a standalone basis 
if a product is seldom sold on a standalone basis  it is unlikely that we can determine vsoe for the product 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product were sold by us on a standalone basis 
our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we consider the anticipated margin on the particular deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar products and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we believe this guidance principally impacts our systems division in which a typical arrangement might involve the sale of various products of our acquisition systems and other seismic equipment 
products under these arrangements are often delivered to the customer within the same period  but in certain situations  depending upon product availability and the customer s delivery requirements  the products could be delivered to the customer at different times 
in these situations  we consider our products to be separate units of accounting provided the delivered product has value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 

table of contents multi client data library our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related expenses  and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for  and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library  million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of an in process multi client data library the period during which the seismic data is being acquired or processed  referred to as the new venture phase consists of determining the percentage of actual revenue recognized to the total estimated revenues which includes both revenues estimated to be realized during the new venture phase and estimated revenues from the licensing of the resulting on the shelf data survey  and multiplying that percentage by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method 
we consider a multi client data survey to be complete when all work on the creation of the seismic data is finished and that data survey is available for licensing 
once a multi client data survey is completed  the data survey is considered on the shelf and our method of amortization is then the greater of i the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the greater amount of amortization resulting from the sales forecast method or the straight line amortization policy is applied on a cumulative basis at the individual survey level 
under this policy  we first record amortization using the sales forecast method 
the cumulative amortization recorded for each survey is then compared with the cumulative straight line amortization 
the four year period utilized in this cumulative comparison commences when the data survey is determined to be complete 
if the cumulative straight line amortization is higher for any specific survey  additional amortization expense is recorded  resulting in the accumulated amortization being equal to the cumulative straight line amortization for that survey 
we have determined the amortization period to be four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during the four years subsequent to survey completion 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 
we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be materially more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under asc impairment and disposal of long lived assets  asc record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no significant impairment charges during  and reserve for excess and obsolete inventories our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory  the timing of market acceptance of our new products and the risk of obsolescence driven by new product introductions 
when we record a charge for excess and obsolete inventories  the amount is applied as a reduction in the cost basis of the specific inventory item for which the charge was recorded 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for these or for other reasons  our reserve would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is allocated to our reporting units  which is either the operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by asc intangibles goodwill and other asc  we established the following reporting units solutions  software and marine systems 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  our impairment test results could differ 
additionally  we compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the individual reporting units less consolidated debt to our overall market capitalization as reflected by the our stock price 

table of contents in accordance with asc  we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not impairment has occurred 
we formally evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment as of december for each of our reporting units 
we first perform a qualitative assessment by evaluating relevant events or circumstances to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if we are unable to conclude qualitatively that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit s fair value exceeds its carrying value  then we will use a two step quantitative assessment of the fair value of a reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit of an entity that includes goodwill is determined to be more than the fair value of the reporting unit  there exists the possibility of impairment of goodwill 
an impairment loss of goodwill is measured in two steps by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to net assets and liabilities including recorded and unrecorded other intangible assets to determine the implied carrying value of goodwill 
the next step is to measure the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied carrying value of goodwill  and  if the implied carrying value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  noting no impairments 
our goodwill as of december  was comprised of million in our marine systems  million in our software and million in our solutions reporting units 
our qualitative assessment indicated that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our software reporting unit exceeds its carrying value 
our quantitative assessment indicated that the fair values of our solutions and marine systems reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
our analyses are based upon our internal operating forecasts  which include assumptions about market and economic conditions 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
if the operational results of our segments are lower than forecasted or the economic conditions are worse than expected  then the fair value of our segments will be adversely affected 
our intangible assets  other than goodwill  relate to our customer relationships and intellectual property rights 
we amortize our intellectual property rights over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
we amortize our customer relationship intangible assets on an accelerated basis over a to year period  using the undiscounted cash flows of the initial valuation models 
we use an accelerated basis as these intangible assets were initially valued using an income approach  with an attrition rate that resulted in a pattern of declining cash flows over a to year period 
following the guidance of asc  we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
similar to our treatment of goodwill  in making these assessments  we rely on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation asc 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to our employees outstanding stock based awards 
the total expense in was comprised of million reflected in cost of sales  million in research  development and engineering expense  million in marketing and sales expense  and million in general  administrative and other operating expense 
deferred tax assets in  we released approximately million of valuation allowance  as we were no longer in a recent cumulative loss position and our projections indicated that these deferred tax assets would likely be realized 
however  additional valuation allowances were established on certain us deferred tax assets related to capital losses and basis differences that will result in capital losses 
we determine the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of asc  income taxes  which requires that a valuation allowance be established or maintained when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we will continue to record a valuation allowance for items that relate to capital losses or basis differences that will create capital losses until there is sufficient evidence to warrant reversal 
in the event that our 
table of contents expectations of future operating results change  an additional valuation allowance may be required to be established on our unreserved net deferred tax assets 
foreign sales risks for  we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in africa and million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for  and  international sales comprised  and  respectively  of total net revenues 
since  global economic problems and uncertainties have generally increased in scope and nature 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in many regions of the world  as well as the collectability of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
certain relationships and related party transactions for  and  we recorded revenues from bgp for purchases of services and products of million  million and million  respectively 
a majority of the revenues from bgp for related to the sale of a twelve streamer digistreamer system 
trade receivables due from bgp were million and million at december  and  respectively 
bgp owned purchased in march approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  for  we paid bgp million for seismic acquisition services provided on one of the our new venture projects 
at december   we owed bgp million for unpaid services received on that project 
until june  we were a party to a support and transition agreement to provide inova geophysical with certain administrative services  including tax  legal  information technology  treasury  human resources  bookkeeping  facilities and marketing services 
the terms of the arrangement provided for inova geophysical to pay us approximately million per month beginning in april for services and to reimburse us for third party and lease costs we incurred directly related to the support of inova geophysical 
we were paid million under this arrangement in the term of the agreement was for two years and it terminated on june  james m 
lapeyre  jr 
is the chairman of the board on our board of directors 
he is also the chairman and a significant equity owner of laitram  llc laitram  and he has served as president of laitram and its predecessors since laitram is a privately owned  new orleans based manufacturer of food processing equipment and modular conveyor belts 
mr 
lapeyre and laitram together owned approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  we acquired digicourse  inc  our marine positioning products business  from laitram in in connection with that acquisition  we entered into a continued services agreement with laitram under which laitram agreed to provide us certain bookkeeping  software  manufacturing  and maintenance services 
manufacturing services consist primarily of machining of parts for our marine positioning systems 
the term of this agreement expired in september but we continue to operate under its terms 
in addition  from time to time  when we have requested  the legal staff of laitram has advised us on certain intellectual property matters with regard to our marine positioning systems 
under an amended lease of commercial property dated february   between lapeyre properties  llc an affiliate of laitram and ion  we have leased certain office and warehouse space from lapeyre properties through january  with the right to terminate the lease sooner upon months notice 
during  we paid laitram and its affiliates a total of approximately million  which consisted of approximately million for manufacturing services  million for rent and other pass through third party facilities charges  and million for reimbursement for costs related to providing administrative and other back office support services in connection with our louisiana marine operations 
for the and fiscal years  we paid laitram and its affiliates a total of approximately million and million  respectively  for these services 
in the opinion of our management  the terms of these services are fair and reasonable and as favorable to us as those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties at the time of their performance 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations 
historically  payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
of that indebtedness  approximately million accrues interest under rates that fluctuate based upon market rates plus an applicable margin 
as of december   the million in outstanding revolving loan indebtedness under the credit facility accrued interest at a rate of per annum 
each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid by approximately million 
as our borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates  we are subject to interest rate risk 
we are therefore impacted by changes in libor and or our bank base rates 
we may  from time to time  use derivative financial instruments eg  interest rate caps  to help mitigate rising interest rates under our credit facility 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our operations are conducted in various countries around the world  and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies with the most significant of our international operations using british pounds sterling 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the united kingdom  china  canada  the netherlands  brazil  russia  the united arab emirates  egypt and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries  a majority of our which is within the united kingdom 
our foreign subsidiaries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in the local currencies  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars
