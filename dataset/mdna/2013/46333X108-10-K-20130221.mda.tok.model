item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking information the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we are an entrepreneurial pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of medicines that improve patients lives 
we have one marketed product  linaclotide  which is available in the united states under the trademarked name linzess and was recently approved in the european union under the trademarked name constella 
linaclotide is also being developed in other parts of the world by certain of our partners 
we are exploring development opportunities to broaden the linzess label  both within its current indication and by investigating potential future indications 
in addition to exploring additional development opportunities  we also have a pipeline of early development candidates and discovery research programs in multiple therapeutic areas 
in august  the fda approved linzess as a once daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from ibs c or cic 
linzess is being commercialized in the us by us and our collaboration partner  forest 
we and forest began commercializing linzess in the us during december in november  the european commission granted marketing approval to constella for the symptomatic treatment of moderate to severe ibs c in adults 
constella will be marketed in europe including the commonwealth of independent states and turkey by almirall and is expected to be commercially available in certain european countries in the first half of astellas  our partner in japan and certain other asian countries  is developing linaclotide for the treatment of patients with ibs c in its territory 
in october  astellas initiated a double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging phase clinical trial of linaclotide in adult patients with ibs c 

table of contents in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with astrazeneca to co develop and co commercialize linaclotide for ibs c in china  hong kong and macau 
in may  we submitted a cta to china state food and drug administration for a phase trial of linaclotide in patients with ibs c 
the cta has been approved 
we continue to assess alternatives to bring linaclotide to ibs c and cic sufferers in the parts of the world outside of our partnered territories 
we are also exploring development opportunities to strengthen the clinical profile of linzess within its indicated population and to expand the product label for additional patient populations and indications  and we are exploring the potential for linaclotide based combination products 
as part of this strategy  we and forest initiated a phase b clinical trial to further characterize the effect of linaclotide on abdominal symptoms in patients with cic 
in addition to exploring further linaclotide development opportunities  our research and development team has generated a pipeline of early development candidates and discovery research in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  cns disorders  allergic conditions and cardiovascular disease 
we were incorporated in delaware as microbia  inc on january  on april   we changed our name to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc prior to september  we held a majority ownership interest in microbia  inc formerly known as microbia precision engineering  a subsidiary formed in september microbia engaged in a specialty biochemicals business based on a proprietary strain development platform 
on september   we sold our interest in microbia to dsm holding company usa  inc  or dsm  in exchange for cash proceeds of million  the payment of approximately million of microbia debt and interest by dsm and future contingent consideration based on the sale of products incorporating microbia technology 
we currently operate in one reportable business segment human therapeutics 
our human therapeutics segment consists of the development and commercialization of our lead product  linaclotide  and other product candidates 
prior to the sale of our interest in microbia  we also operated in the biomanufacturing segment 
our biomanufacturing segment  which comprised a much smaller part of our business  consisted of our majority ownership interest in microbia 
our human therapeutics segment represented of our total assets at december  and for the year ended december   results of operations of our biomanufacturing segment are included in net income from discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
to date  we have dedicated substantially all of our activities to the research  development and commercialization of linaclotide  our lead product  as well as research and development of our other product candidates 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in we incurred net losses attributable to ironwood pharmaceuticals  inc of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future 
in february  we sold  shares of our class a common stock through a firm commitment  underwritten public offering at a price to the public of per share 
as a result of the offering  we received aggregate net proceeds  after underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated offering expenses  of approximately million 
on january   we closed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of notes due on or before june  the notes bear an annual interest rate of  with interest paid quarterly beginning june   and principal expected to be paid quarterly beginning march  as a result of the debt offering  we received aggregate net proceeds  after offering expenses  of approximately million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this debt financing 
table of contents to fund our research and development efforts and to support the commercial launch of linzess  in addition to general corporate purposes 
financial overview revenue 
revenue to date from our human therapeutics segment has been generated primarily through our collaboration agreements with forest and astrazeneca  and our license agreements with almirall and astellas 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  ii research and development activities  and iii the manufacture of api  finished drug product and development materials for the collaborative partners 
payments to us may include one or more of the following nonrefundable license fees  payments for research and development activities  payments for the manufacture of api  finished drug product and development materials  and payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
additionally  we will receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the us and china 
linzess launched in the us in the fourth quarter of and constella is expected to be commercially available in certain european countries in the first half of we record our share of the net profits and losses from the sales of linzess in the us on a net basis and present the settlement payments as collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense  as applicable 
net profits or losses consist of net sales to third party customers in the us less the cost to manufacture linzess as well as selling and marketing expenses 
although we expect net sales to increase during the launch phase  the settlement payments between forest and us resulting in collaborative arrangement revenue or collaboration expense are subject to fluctuation based on the ratio of selling and marketing expenses incurred by each party 
in addition  our collaborative arrangements revenue may fluctuate as a result of timing and amount of license fees and clinical and commercial milestones received and recognized under our current and future strategic partnerships as well as timing and amount of royalties from the sales of constella in the european market 
revenue from our biomanufacturing segment was generated by our former subsidiary  microbia  which had entered into research and development service agreements with various third parties 
these agreements generally provided for fees for research and development services rendered 
as a result of the sale of our interest in microbia  revenue from our biomanufacturing segment  for the year ended december   is included in net income from discontinued operations 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue is recognized upon shipment of linaclotide api to certain of our collaboration partners 
our cost of revenue consists of the costs of producing such api 
we expensed most of the manufacturing costs of api as research and development expenses in the periods prior to july   at which date we began capitalizing linaclotide related inventory costs as their realizability became probable 
as of december   the previously expensed api inventory that is commercially saleable has been substantially utilized 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase in future periods 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery  development  manufacture and distribution of our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses  research and development related facility costs  third party contract costs relating to research  formulation  manufacturing  nonclinical study and clinical trial activities as well as licensing fees for our product candidates prior to regulatory approval 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
under our forest and astrazeneca collaboration agreements  we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses  and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 
payments to forest or astrazeneca are recorded as incremental research and development expense 

table of contents the costs of revenue related to the microbia services contracts and costs associated with microbia research and development activities are included in net income loss from discontinued operations 
our lead product is linaclotide  and it represents the largest portion of our research and development expense for our product candidates 
linaclotide is our only product or product candidate that has demonstrated clinical proof of concept 
an nda for linzess with respect to both ibs c and cic was approved by the fda in august in november  the ema approved constella for the treatment of ibs c in adults 
we are also exploring development opportunities to strengthen the clinical profile of linzess within its indicated population and to expand the product label for additional patient populations and indications  and we are exploring the potential for linaclotide based combination products 
as part of this strategy  we and forest initiated a phase b clinical trial to further characterize the effect of linaclotide on abdominal symptoms in patients with cic 
in addition to exploring further linaclotide development opportunities  we also have a pipeline focused on both research and development of early development candidates and discovery research in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  cns disorders  allergic conditions and cardiovascular disease 
the following table sets forth our research and development expenses related to our product pipeline for the years ended december   and these expenses relate primarily to external costs associated with manufacturing  including supply chain development  nonclinical studies and clinical trial costs 
costs related to facilities  depreciation  share based compensation and research and development support services are not directly charged to programs 
years ended december  in thousands demonstrated clinical proof of concept early development candidates discovery research since  the date we began tracking costs by program  we have incurred approximately million of research and development expenses related to linaclotide 
the expenses for linaclotide include both reimbursements to us by forest or astrazeneca as well as our portion of research and development costs incurred by forest or astrazeneca for linaclotide and invoiced to us under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreements 
the lengthy process of securing regulatory approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
in august  the fda approved our nda for linzess as a once daily treatment for adult men and women suffering from ibs c and cic 
in connection with the fda approval  we are required to conduct certain nonclinical and clinical studies aimed at understanding a whether orally administered linaclotide can be detected in breast milk  b the potential for antibodies to be developed to linaclotide  and if so  c whether antibodies specific for linaclotide could have any therapeutic or safety implications 
in addition  we and forest established a nonclinical and clinical post marketing plan with the fda to understand linzess efficacy and safety in pediatric patients 
in october  we entered into a collaboration agreement with astrazeneca under which we will jointly develop and commercialize linaclotide in china  hong kong and macau 
we also are exploring the expansion of linaclotide in other parts of the world outside of our currently partnered territories  as well as the potential for linaclotide in other indications and the potential for linaclotide based combination 
table of contents products 
therefore  we cannot currently estimate with any degree of certainty the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on linaclotide in pediatrics  for other geographic markets or additional indications 
we also continue to advance our pipeline focused on early development candidates and discovery research in multiple therapeutic areas  including gastrointestinal disease  cns disorders  allergic conditions and cardiovascular disease 
given the inherent uncertainties that come with the development of pharmaceutical products  we cannot estimate with any degree of certainty how these programs will evolve  and therefore the amount of time or money that would be required to obtain regulatory approval to market them 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of any approvals  we are currently unable to estimate precisely when  if ever  linaclotide will be developed in pediatrics or for other indications or markets  or when  if ever  any of our other product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
we invest carefully in our pipeline  and the commitment of funding for each subsequent stage of our development programs is dependent upon the receipt of clear  supportive data 
in addition  we are actively engaged in evaluating externally discovered drug candidates at all stages of development 
in evaluating potential assets  we apply the same criteria as those used for investments in internally discovered assets 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risks including  but not limited to the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a product candidate and are difficult to predict 
the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of a product candidate may not be favorable 
the emergence of competing technologies and products and other adverse market developments may negatively impact us 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and costs to complete current or future nonclinical and clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of our products and product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the data of each product candidate  the competitive landscape and ongoing assessments of such product candidate commercial potential 
as a result of the regulatory approvals in  linzess began generating sales in the fourth quarter of upon commercial launch in the us and constella is expected to be commercially available in the european market in the first half of we expect our research and development costs will be substantial for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to invest in linaclotide including the areas of its supply chain and the exploration of its 
table of contents utility in other indications and other patient populations 
we will also invest in our other product candidates as we advance them through nonclinical studies and clinical trials  in addition to funding full time equivalents for research and development activities under our external collaboration and license agreements 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses for personnel in our administrative  finance  legal  information technology  business development  commercial  sales  marketing and human resource functions 
other costs include the legal costs of pursuing patent protection of our intellectual property  general and administrative related facility costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services 
we anticipate substantial increases in expenses related to developing the organization necessary to further support the commercial launch of linzess  including expanding our commercial and sales force teams 
we charge all selling  general and administrative expenses to operations as incurred 
under our forest and astrazeneca collaboration agreements  we are reimbursed for certain selling and or marketing expenses and we net these reimbursements against our selling  general and administrative expenses as incurred 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we include forest selling and marketing cost sharing payments in the calculation of the net profits and net losses from the sale of linzess in the us and present the net payment to or from forest as collaboration expense or collaborative arrangements revenue  respectively 
the selling and marketing cost sharing payments for the prior periods were classified as selling  general and administrative expenses 
collaboration expense 
collaboration expense represents of linzess net sales in the u 
s as well as cost of revenue and selling and marketing cost sharing settlement between us and forest 
prior to the fourth quarter of  such selling and marketing cost sharing payments were presented within selling  general and administrative expenses and were not material to the consolidated financial statements 
we expect our collaboration expense to vary in the short term due to the effects of the net profit or loss sharing arrangement under the collaboration with forest 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods and related disclosures 
these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation and related reserves  research and development expenses and share based compensation are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
these critical estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that our application of the following accounting policies  each of which require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management  are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 

table of contents revenue recognition our revenue is generated primarily through collaborative research and development and license agreements 
the terms of these agreements contain multiple deliverables which may include i licenses  ii research and development activities  and iii the manufacture of finished drug product  api and development materials for the collaborative partner 
payments to us under these agreements may include non refundable license fees  payments for research and development activities  payments for the manufacture of finished drug product  api and development materials  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
additionally  we may receive our share of the net profits or bear our share of the net losses from the sale of linaclotide in the us and china 
we evaluate revenue from agreements that have multiple elements under the guidance of accounting standards update  or asu  no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu  which we adopted in january we identify the deliverables included within the agreement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting 
we account for those components as separate elements when the following criteria are met the delivered items have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  if there is a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and within our control 
the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
the determination that multiple elements in an arrangement meet the criteria for separate units of accounting requires us to exercise our judgment 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  services have been rendered or delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
the determination of whether we should recognize revenue on a gross or net basis involves judgment based on the relevant facts and circumstances  which relate primarily to whether we act as a principal or agent in the process of generating revenues from our collaboration and licensing arrangements 
in making this assessment  we consider whether we are the primary obligor in the arrangement and whether we have the risks and rewards of ownership 
for certain of our arrangements  particularly our license agreement with almirall  it is required that taxes be withheld on payments to us 
we have adopted a policy to recognize revenue net of these tax withholdings 
up front license fees we recognize revenues from nonrefundable  up front license fees related to collaboration and license agreements entered into before january   including the million up front license fee under the forest collaboration agreement entered into in september  the million up front license fee  of which million was received net of foreign withholding taxes  under the almirall license agreement entered into in april and the million up front license fee under the astellas license agreement entered into in november  on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance since the license deliverables were not deemed to have value on a standalone basis and we could not determine the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the period of performance over which the revenues are recognized is typically the period over which the research and or development is expected to occur 
as a result  we often are required to make estimates regarding drug development and commercialization timelines for compounds being developed pursuant 
table of contents to a collaboration or license agreement 
because the drug development process is lengthy and our collaboration and license agreements typically cover activities over several years  this approach has resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue into future periods 
in addition  because of the many risks and uncertainties associated with the development of drug candidates  our estimates regarding the period of performance may change in the future 
any change in our estimates could result in substantial changes to the period over which the revenues from an up front license fee are recognized 
in june  we revised our estimate of the development period associated with our almirall license agreement from months to months and adjusted the amortization of the remaining deferred revenue accordingly 
aside from this change  we have had no other material changes to our estimated periods of continuing involvement under existing collaboration and license agreements 
at september   the up front license fees under the forest and almirall collaborations were fully amortized 
we recognize revenue allocated to the license related to collaboration and license agreements entered into or materially modified on or after january   including the amounts allocated to the license under the astrazeneca collaboration agreement entered into in october  upon delivery  when we believe the license to our intellectual property has stand alone value 
when we recognize revenue allocated to the license upon delivery under any of our collaborations  we may experience significant fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenues from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of transactions 
when we believe the license to our intellectual property does not have stand alone value from the other deliverables to be provided in the arrangement  we recognize revenue attributed to the license on a straight line basis over the contractual or estimated performance period 
milestones at the inception of each arrangement that includes contingent milestone payments  we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive 
this evaluation includes an assessment of whether a the consideration is commensurate with either the entity performance to achieve the milestone  or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item s as a result of a specific outcome resulting from the entity performance to achieve the milestone  b the consideration relates solely to past performance and c the consideration is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement 
we evaluate factors such as the scientific  clinical  regulatory  commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestone  the level of effort and investment required and whether the milestone consideration is reasonable relative to all deliverables and payment terms in the arrangement in making this assessment 
substantive milestones are due to us upon the initiation of a phase study for linaclotide in japan and upon the filing and approval of the japanese equivalent of an nda with the relevant regulatory authority in japan 
on january   we adopted asu no 
 revenue recognition milestone method  or asu as a result of this adoption  in those circumstances where a substantive milestone is achieved and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured  we recognize revenue related to the milestone in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved 
prior to january   in those circumstances where a substantive milestone was achieved  collection of the related receivable was reasonably assured and we had remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement  we recognized as revenue on the date the milestone was achieved an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that had elapsed as of the date the milestone was achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
milestone payments received prior to the adoption of asu under the forest collaboration and almirall license agreement were recognized based upon this method 

table of contents milestones that are not considered substantive are recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
commercial milestones are accounted for as royalties and are recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
all of the milestones that have been achieved to date under our forest collaboration agreement and our almirall license agreement were substantive 
as of december   we had not achieved any milestones under our astellas license agreement or astrazeneca collaboration agreement 
payments received or reasonably assured after performance obligations are fully met are recognized as earned 
because the recognition of a substantive milestone under a collaboration agreement typically requires the completion of a number of activities conducted over a significant period of time  the expenses related to achieving the milestone often are incurred prior to the period in which the milestone payment is recognized 
when we do achieve milestones that we consider substantive under any of our collaborations  we may experience significant fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of achieving such substantive milestones 
net profit or net loss sharing we recognize our share of the pre tax commercial net profit or net loss generated from the sales of linzess in the us in the period the product sales are recorded by forest and related cost of product sales and selling and marketing expenses are incurred by us and our collaboration partner 
these amounts are partially determined based on amounts provided by forest and involve the use of estimates and judgments  such as product sales allowances and accruals related to prompt payment discounts  chargebacks  governmental and contractual rebates  wholesaler fees  product returns  and co payment assistance costs  which could be adjusted based on actual results in the future 
we are highly dependent on forest for timely and accurate information regarding any net revenues realized from sales of linzess and the costs incurred in selling it  in order to accurately report our results of operations 
for the periods covered in the consolidated financial statements presented  there have been no significant or material changes to prior period estimates of revenues  cost of revenue and selling and marketing expenses associated with the sales of linzess in the us however  if we do not receive timely and accurate information or incorrectly estimate activity levels associated with the collaboration at a given point in time  we could be required to record adjustments in future periods 
we record our share of the net profits or net losses from the sales of linzess on a net basis and present the settlement payments as collaborative arrangements revenue or collaboration expense  as applicable 
we and our collaborative partner settle the cost sharing quarterly  and each payment represents of linzess net sales in the u 
s as well as the cost sharing settlement of selling and marketing expenses and cost of revenue between us and forest 
prior to  such selling and marketing cost sharing payments were presented within selling  general and administrative expenses and were not material to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents other we produce api  finished drug product and development materials for certain of our collaborators 
we recognize revenue on api  finished drug product and development materials when the material has passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance  delivery has occurred  title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
as it relates to development materials and api produced for almirall and astellas  we are reimbursed at a contracted rate 
such reimbursements are considered as part of revenue generated by almirall and astellas license agreements and presented as collaborative arrangements revenue 
any api  finished drug product and development materials currently produced for forest or astrazeneca are recognized in accordance with the cost sharing provisions of the forest and astrazeneca collaboration agreements  respectively 
we may experience fluctuations in our collaborative arrangements revenue from quarter to quarter and year to year depending on the timing of such transactions 
inventory valuation and related reserves inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out basis 
we evaluate inventory levels quarterly and any inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  inventory that becomes obsolete  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications is written down with a corresponding charge to cost of revenue in the period that the impairment is first identified 
we capitalize inventories manufactured in preparation for initiating sales of a product candidate when the related product candidate is considered to have a high likelihood of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through sales of the inventories 
in determining whether or not to capitalize such inventories  we evaluate  among other factors  information regarding the product candidate safety and efficacy  the status of regulatory submissions and communications with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial sales  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive drugs and the availability of reimbursement 
in addition  we evaluate risks associated with manufacturing the product candidate and the remaining shelf life of the inventories 
costs associated with developmental products prior to satisfying the inventory capitalization criteria are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments and any changes in these judgments may have a material impact on our financial results in future periods 
research and development expense all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses comprise costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including compensation  benefits and other employee costs  share based compensation expense  laboratory supplies and other direct expenses  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  licensing fees for our product candidates prior to regulatory approval  milestone payments associated with our licensing agreements  contractual services  including clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  and other external expenses 
clinical trial expenses include expenses associated with contract research organizations  or cros 
the invoicing from cros for services rendered can lag several months 
we accrue the cost of services rendered in connection with cro activities based on our estimate of site management  monitoring costs  project management costs  and investigator fees 
we maintain regular communication with our cro vendors to gauge the reasonableness of our estimates 
differences between actual clinical trial expenses and estimated clinical trial expenses recorded have not been 
table of contents material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
under our forest and astrazeneca collaboration agreements  we are reimbursed for certain research and development expenses and we net these reimbursements against our research and development expenses as incurred 
payments to forest or astrazeneca are recorded as incremental research and development expense 
nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities are capitalized and expensed over the related service period or as goods are received 
share based compensation expense we recognize compensation expense for all time based vested awards based on the grant date fair value 
these costs are recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we record the expense of services rendered by non employees based on the estimated fair value of the stock option using the black scholes option pricing model as of the respective vesting date 
further  we expense the fair value of non employee stock options over the vesting term of the underlying stock options 
for employee share based awards  we estimate the fair value of the share based awards  including stock options  using the black scholes option pricing model 
determining the fair value of share based awards requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the award and expected stock price volatility 
the weighted average assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards granted in  and are set forth below years ended december  volatility dividend yield expected life of options in years risk free interest rate the assumptions used in determining the fair value of share based awards represent management best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change  and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation could be materially different in the future 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a zero coupon us treasury instrument with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the share based award 
because we do not have a sufficient history to estimate the expected term  we use the simplified method as described in sab topic d for estimating the expected term 
the simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our initial public offering  we lacked company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we use a blended volatility rate using our own historical volatility and that of publicly traded peer companies 
for purposes of identifying publicly traded peer companies  we selected publicly traded companies that are in the biopharmaceutical industry  have products or product candidates in similar therapeutic areas gastrointestinal dysfunction and pain management and stages of nonclinical and clinical development as us  have sufficient trading history to derive a historic volatility rate and have similar vesting terms as our granted options 
we have not paid and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our shares of common stock  therefore  the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero 
we also recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
accordingly  we have estimated expected forfeitures of stock options based on our historical forfeiture rate  adjusted for known trends  and used these rates in developing a future forfeiture rate 
our forfeiture rates were  and as of december   and  respectively 
if our actual forfeiture 
table of contents rate varies from our historical rates and estimates  additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods 
prior to our initial public offering  we granted stock options at exercise prices not less than the fair value of our common stock as determined by our board of directors  with input from management 
due to the absence of an active market for our common stock  prior to our initial public offering on february   our board of directors had historically determined  with input from management  the estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we have also granted performance based stock options with terms that allow the recipients to vest in a specific number of shares based upon the achievement of performance based milestones as specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these performance based stock options is recognized if the performance condition is considered probable of achievement using management best estimates of the time to vesting for the achievement of the performance based milestones 
if the actual achievement of the performance based milestones varies from our estimates  share based compensation expense could be materially different than what is recorded in the period 
the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of a change in the estimated time to vesting for performance based stock options will be recognized as compensation cost in the period of the revision  and recorded as a change in estimate 
we have also granted time accelerated stock options with terms that allow the acceleration in vesting of the stock options upon the achievement of performance based milestones specified in the grants 
share based compensation expense associated with these time accelerated stock options is recognized over the requisite service period of the awards or the implied service period  if shorter 
while the assumptions used to calculate and account for share based compensation awards represents management best estimates  these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if revisions are made to our underlying assumptions and estimates  our share based compensation expense could vary significantly from period to period 
as of december   there was approximately million and million of unrecognized share based compensation  net of estimated forfeitures  related to restricted stock awards and unvested stock option grants with time based vesting  respectively which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of year and years  respectively 
the total unrecognized share based compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
additionally  at december   approximately million of additional share based compensation related to options subject to performance based milestone vesting was not yet recognized

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue years ended december  change dollars in thousands collaborative arrangements revenue collaborative arrangements 
the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to the additional million in milestone payments we earned under the forest collaboration agreement and the million in revenue earned under the astrazeneca collaboration agreement  principally related to the license for linaclotide in china 
in 
table of contents august  we achieved two milestones totaling million under the forest collaboration agreement due to the fda approval of the linaclotide nda for both ibs c and cic 
in  we achieved two milestones totaling million upon the fda acceptance of the linaclotide nda for both ibs c and cic 
additionally  during  we recognized approximately million more in shipments of linaclotide api  primarily to almirall in anticipation of a potential commercial launch in europe in the first half of these increases were offset by an million decrease in the amortization of deferred revenue associated with the development phase of the collaboration and license agreements with forest and almirall as the performance periods ended in september cost and expenses years ended december  change dollars in thousands cost and expenses cost of revenue research and development selling  general and administrative collaboration expense total cost and expenses cost of revenue 
the increase in cost of revenue of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was related to our inventory capitalization policy 
we expensed most of the manufacturing costs of api for linaclotide as research and development expenses in the periods prior to july  in the third quarter of  we began capitalizing inventory costs for linaclotide api manufactured in preparation for its planned launch in the us and europe 
as of december   the previously expensed api inventory that is commercially saleable has been substantially utilized 
research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily related to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits  and employee related expenses associated mainly with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million associated with linaclotide development  consisting of increased contract manufacturing costs associated with validation of batches of linaclotide api in anticipation of a potential commercial launch  higher collaboration expenses from forest and decreased reimbursements from forest  partially offset by a decrease in contract research associated with lower clinical trial expenses  an increase of approximately million in research and development related facilities costs  including rent  property taxes and amortization of leasehold improvements  associated with additional space we leased and improved in our binney street facility  an increase of approximately million in research costs related to our other pipeline candidates  including research and development fees  and up front and milestone payments associated with our licensing agreements  and an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of increases in our workforce expenses and infrastructure due to the commercial launch of linaclotide in the us these increases include approximately million in compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with increased headcount  mainly due to a newly hired field sales force  external consulting costs of approximately million 
table of contents primarily associated with developing the infrastructure to commercialize and support linaclotide  including sales training and conferences  approximately million in selling  general and administrative related facilities and it infrastructure costs associated with operating our binney street facility  including rent and amortization of leasehold improvements  approximately million in corporate legal  patent and other professional service fees  and approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february these increases are offset by an approximately million decrease in amounts related to the cost sharing arrangement with forest  which are presented as collaboration expense in the year ended december  and were not reclassified from selling  general and administrative expense in as the amount was not material to the consolidated financial statements 
collaboration expense 
collaboration expense increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily the result of a net increase in selling and marketing expenses incurred by forest under our collaboration agreement  partially offset by our share of linzess sales in the us prior to  such selling and marketing cost sharing payments were presented within selling  general and administrative expenses 
other income expense  net years ended december  change dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense interest and investment income other income total other income expense  net interest and investment income 
the decrease in interest and investment income of approximately  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances and lower interest rates 
other income 
the decrease in other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the timing of tax incentives or awards we received 
in  we recognized a life sciences tax incentive program award of approximately million from the massachusetts life sciences center 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue years ended december  change dollars in thousands collaborative arrangements revenue collaborative arrangements 
the increase in revenue from collaborative arrangements for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from the achievement of the million ibs c nda acceptance milestone and the achievement of the million cic nda acceptance milestone in our forest collaboration 
in accordance with asu  which we adopted in january  we recognized these substantive 
table of contents milestones in their entirety upon their achievement 
other changes in revenue were mostly related to the almirall license agreement 
in june  we revised our estimate to shorten the development period associated with the almirall license agreement which resulted in approximately million in additional revenue recognized in this amount is partially offset by the revenue recognized upon achievement of the phase milestone of million in november the revenue from this milestone was recorded pre adoption of asu and resulted in the recognition of approximately million more in revenue during than in cost and expenses years ended december  change dollars in thousands cost and expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits  and employee related expenses associated mainly with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million in external research costs related to the research and development fees paid in connection with our licensing agreements that are not related to linaclotide  offset by a decrease of approximately million in support of linaclotide  primarily resulting from lower clinical trial and collaboration expenses as we completed the efficacy portion of linaclotide development program 
selling  general and administrative expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in compensation  benefits and other employee related expenses associated with increased headcount  an increase of approximately million in share based compensation expense primarily related to our new hire grants and our annual stock option grant made in february  an increase of approximately million in selling  general and administrative related facilities costs primarily due to increased depreciation expense associated with the amortization of leasehold improvements at our binney street facility and improvements in our it infrastructure  an increase in external consulting costs of approximately million primarily associated with developing the infrastructure to commercialize and support linaclotide and an increase of approximately million in the net expenses from forest on our collaborative commercial activities 

table of contents other income expense  net years ended december  change dollars in thousands other income expense interest expense interest and investment income other income total other income expense  net interest expense 
the decrease in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of a reduction in long term debt associated with the payment of all the long term debt in september interest and investment income 
the decrease in interest and investment income of approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was due to lower average cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
other income 
the decrease in other income for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the timing of tax incentives or awards we received 
in  we recognized a life sciences tax incentive program award of approximately million from the massachusetts life sciences center 
in  we recognized approximately million in federal grants awarded to us under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
income tax benefit expense 
the approximately million decrease in income tax benefit for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is related to intra period income tax allocation requirements in for which we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of approximately million  offset by an identical income tax provision from discontinued operations for the year ended december  the intra period income tax allocation considers discontinued operations for purposes of determining the amount of tax benefit that results from our loss from continuing operations 
there was no corresponding tax allocation in net income loss from discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations in is associated with the approximately million gain recognized on the sale of microbia  partially offset by the tax provision related to the intra period tax allocation 
as a result of the sale of microbia in september  there were no discontinued operations in net income loss from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest 
the approximately million in net income from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest for the year ended december  was attributable to amounts recognized by microbia immediately prior to the sale of microbia in september as a result of the sale of microbia in september  there was no corresponding income in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash for each of the periods set forth below years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we have incurred losses since our inception on january  and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of preferred stock and common stock  including approximately million of net proceeds from our ipo  million of net proceeds from our follow on public offering  payments received under collaborative arrangements  including reimbursement of certain expenses  debt financings and interest earned on investments 
at december   we had approximately million of unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
our cash equivalents include amounts held in money market funds  stated at cost plus accrued interest  which approximates fair market value and amounts held in certain us government sponsored securities 
our available for sale securities include amounts held in us treasury securities and us government sponsored securities 
we invest cash in excess of immediate requirements in accordance with our investment policy  which limits the amounts we may invest in any one type of investment and requires all investments held by us to be at least a rated  with a remaining maturity when purchased of less than twelve months  so as to primarily achieve liquidity and capital preservation 
during the year ended december   our cash balances increased approximately million 
this increase is primarily due to the approximately million in net proceeds from our public stock offering in february  million in milestone payments from forest upon the fda approval of linzess in august  the million upfront payment from astrazeneca and approximately million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of shares pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan 
these sources of cash were partially offset by the cash used to operate our business  as we made payments related to  among other things  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as we continue to increase headcount and build infrastructure to support the commercial launch of linzess in the us and as we continue to invest in our research pipeline 
we also invested approximately million in capital expenditures and made payments of approximately million on our capital leases 
on january   we closed a private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of notes due on or before june  as a result of the debt offering  we received aggregate net proceeds  after offering expenses  of approximately million 
the notes bear an annual interest rate of  with interest paid quarterly beginning june   and principal expected to be paid quarterly beginning march  after the interest only period  we will make quarterly payments on the notes equal to the greater of i of net sales of linzess in the us for the preceding quarter  or the synthetic royalty amount  and ii accrued and unpaid interest on the notes  or the required interest amount 
principal on the notes will be repaid in an amount equal to the synthetic royalty amount minus the required interest amount  when this is a positive number  until the principal has been paid in full 
the notes may be redeemed at any time prior to maturity  in whole or in part  at

funding requirements while we began commercializing linaclotide in the fourth quarter of  we have not achieved profitability 
in august  we received approval for linzess in the us and commenced our commercial launch with our collaboration partner  forest  in december in november  our european partner  almirall  received approval for constella for the treatment of ibs c in adults  which will be marketed in europe by almirall and is expected to become commercially available in certain countries in the first half of our partnership with forest requires total net sales of linzess to be reduced by commercial costs incurred by each party  and such resulting net profit or net loss attributable to linzess will be shared equally between us and forest 
we will also receive escalating royalties from almirall for the sales of linaclotide in europe 
we cannot anticipate when  if ever  proceeds generated from sales of linzess and constella will enable the company to become cash flow positive 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial expenses for the next several years as we further develop and commercialize linaclotide in the u 
s and in other markets and continue to invest in our pipeline 
in addition  we are generally required to make cash expenditures to manufacture linaclotide api in advance of selling it to our collaboration partners and collecting payments for such inventory sales  which may result in significant periodic uses of cash 
we believe that our cash on hand as of december   in addition to the net proceeds of million from the debt offering closed in january  will be sufficient to meet our projected operating needs at least through the next twelve months 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations  including the underlying estimates regarding the costs to obtain regulatory approval and the costs to commercialize linaclotide in the us and other markets  is a forward looking 
table of contents statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
we have based our estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate precisely the amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete the development of  and to obtain regulatory approval for  linaclotide other than in the us and us and our other product candidates for all of the indications for which we believe each product candidate is suited 
our funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of our commercialization activities  the expenses we incur in marketing and selling linaclotide and our product candidates  the revenue generated by sales of linaclotide and our product candidates  the success of our third party manufacturing activities  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  the success of our research and development efforts  the emergence of competing or complementary developments  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any additional collaborative  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies 
financing strategy we may  from time to time  consider additional funding through a combination of new collaborative arrangements  strategic alliances  and additional equity and debt financings or from other sources 
we will continue to manage our capital structure and to consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will also be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
contractual commitments and obligations under our collaborative agreements with forest and astrazeneca  we share with forest and astrazeneca all development and commercialization costs related to linaclotide in the us and china  respectively 
the actual amounts that we pay our partners or that partners pay to us will depend on numerous factors outside of our control  including the success of our clinical development efforts with respect to linaclotide  the content and timing of decisions made by the regulators  the reimbursement and competitive landscape around linaclotide and our other product candidates  and other factors described under the heading risk factors 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
the contracts with cros generally are cancellable  with notice  at our option and do not have any significant cancellation penalties 
these items are not included in the table below 

table of contents in october  we entered into an amendment to our binney street building lease  pursuant to which we will rent  square feet of additional space in four stages 
each stage will commence no later than december   june   june  and june   respectively 
the amendment also extends the term of the entire lease agreement by months 
as of december   we have multiple commercial supply agreements with contract manufacturing organizations for the purchase of linaclotide api and finished drug product 
the table below reflects our minimum purchase requirements under these commercial supply agreements  as well as any outstanding non cancellable purchase orders 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  excluding interest payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands commercial supply obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations our commitment for capital lease obligations principally relates to leased computer and office equipment 
our commitments for operating leases relate to our lease of office and laboratory space in cambridge  massachusetts and our data collocation space in boston 
in addition to the commitments discussed above  we have commitments to make potential future milestone payments to third parties under certain of our license and collaboration arrangements totaling approximately million  which include million for development milestones and million for regulatory milestones 
we are also committed to make potential future milestone payments of up to million per product to one of our collaboration partners  including million for development milestones  million for regulatory milestones and million for sales based milestones 
these milestones primarily include the commencement and results of clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approval in various jurisdictions and the future commercial success of development programs  the outcome and timing of which are difficult to predict and subject to significant uncertainty 
in addition to the milestones discussed above  we are obligated to pay royalties on future sales  which are contingent on generating levels of sales of future products that have not been achieved and may never be achieved 
since we are unable to reliably estimate the timing and amounts of such milestone and royalty payments  or whether they will occur at all  these contingent payments have been excluded from the table above 
see note  collaboration and license agreements  in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our license and collaboration arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements as that term is defined in item a ii of regulation s k or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships 
we enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally deposits  securities issued by the us government and its agencies and money market instruments 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates  particularly because our investments are in short term marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio and the low risk profile of our investments  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
accordingly  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our investment portfolio 
recently  there has been concern in the credit markets regarding the value of a variety of mortgage backed and auction rate securities and the resulting effect on various securities markets 
we do not currently have any auction rate securities 
we do not believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments have significant risk of default or illiquidity 
while we believe our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities do not contain excessive risk  we cannot provide absolute assurance that in the future our investments will not be subject to adverse changes in market value 
in addition  we maintain significant amounts of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities at one or more financial institutions that are in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot provide assurance that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
our capital lease obligations bear interest at a fixed rate and therefore have minimal exposure to changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have no operations outside the us and do not have any foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation and changing prices over the years ended december   and had a significant impact on our results of operations
