this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our 
table of contents current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about telenav and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in risk factors in item a of this form k  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview our mission is to make people lives less stressful  more productive  and more fun when they are on the go 
we are a leader in personalized mobile navigation 
we help on the go people by creating products that provide easily accessed  relevant  and personalized information for discovery  traffic  maps  local search  and navigation and are available across multiple platforms and devices  including mobile phones  tablets  computers and cars 
with millions of users able to access telenav services while on the go today  we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on growing location services market opportunities  especially as related to connected cars and mobile advertising 
we offer our mobile navigation services to customers in a number of ways 
we distribute our services through our wireless carrier partners  including at t mobility  and directly to consumers through mobile application stores and marketplaces 
generally  we provide our basic services to consumers for free and provide consumers the opportunity to purchase premium versions of the product 
we refer to the free to premium distribution as the freemium model of distribution 
our free products are designed to be monetized through delivery of advertising to consumers 
our success with the freemium model depends upon our ability to generate a substantial active user base as well as the ability to generate revenues from advertising and conversion of users from free to premium services 
we offer our automotive navigation services to auto manufacturers and oems  for distribution with their vehicles 
our primary customer to date  ford  currently distributes our product as an optional feature with the majority of its models in the us  mexico  south america and china 
we also have relationships with automotive oems that distribute our products with other major auto manufacturers 
our automotive solutions are typically a self contained service along with the related software and content within the car  or on board  and are often enhanced through connection to data services for additional real time capabilities such as traffic 
our history as a cloud based supplier of navigation services provides a unique advantage in the marketplace over our competitors 
our advertising network services offer advertisers significant audience reach  sophisticated targeting capabilities and the ability to deliver interactive and engaging ad experiences to consumers on their mobile devices 
we are experts in location based advertising and offer unique value to brick and mortar and brand advertisers with our location targeting capabilities 
we do this by accessing a large universe of impressions  and filtering out those that are tagged with accurate  real time and historical location information 
we filter out these impressions using a wide range of sophisticated proprietary techniques 
in june  our platform accessed approximately billion potential ad impressions 
we derive revenue from wireless carriers and end users  automobile manufacturers and oems  and mobile advertisers and advertising agencies 
we primarily derive our revenue from automobile manufacturers whose vehicles contain our proprietary software and are able to access our navigation services 
we also derive revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers who sell our mobile navigation services to their subscribers 
in addition  we have a growing business in mobile advertising where our customers are primarily advertising agencies that represent national and regional brick and mortar brands and channel partners that work closely with local and small business advertisers 
we generate revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of customized software in automotive navigation applications 
for example  ford utilizes our on board automotive navigation product in its ford sync platform  which includes myford touch and mylincoln touch 
ford began shipping this product in certain north american vehicles with the model year  and our navigation solution is currently deployed in different ford and lincoln models 
ford and lincoln models with our on board automotive navigation product began shipping to south america with the model year and china with the model year 
our automobile manufacturer and oem customers pay us a royalty fee as the software is reproduced for installation in vehicles with our automotive navigation solutions 
we generate revenue from mobile navigation services through service subscriptions  including premium offerings  and fixed fee arrangements 
end users with subscriptions for our services are generally billed for our services through their wireless carrier or through application stores 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any 
table of contents number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
we generate revenue from advertising network services through the delivery of search and display advertising impressions based on the specific terms of the advertising contract 
recent developments our agreement with wireless carrier sprint provided that sprint will cease to compensate us for services we provide to its customers through bundled offerings 
in april  we entered into an agreement to extend the period by which sprint would provide us with limited compensation by days to september  because of the manner in which we recognize revenue for bundled services to sprint  the extension of the agreement with sprint by days requires us to recognize some revenue that otherwise would have been recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal commencing on october   we expect that sprint will no longer provide us material compensation for our services on a fixed fee basis and the revenue we will receive from sprint will consist primarily of revenue from monthly recurring fees paid by end users for premium services or shared advertising revenue 
during fiscal  we also saw declines in the number of paid monthly recurring fee end users at other large wireless carrier customers  at t and t mobile  and we expect this trend to continue 
as a result  we expect that our revenue from wireless carrier partners will continue to decline substantially and that the composition of the remaining wireless carrier revenue will change over the near term 
we expect our total revenue in fiscal will decline substantially from previous years as we do not foresee revenue from automotive navigation or advertising growing sufficiently to offset the loss of wireless carrier revenue in fiscal we do not expect to be able to reduce our cost of services revenue at the same rate as services revenue  if at all 
we will continue to incur significant costs  especially third party content and data center operations costs  associated with providing our navigation services at reduced revenue rates or free under our freemium distribution model 
we also anticipate that because of our efforts to grow automotive  mobile advertising and other strategic revenue sources  our operating expenses are not expected to decline in fiscal at the same rate as our revenue 
as a result  we believe that we will incur substantial net losses in fiscal if we are unable or elect not to reduce our expenses  we may not be able to achieve profitability in fiscal and possibly beyond 
in fiscal  as has been the case to a lesser extent in fiscal  we expect that subscription revenue from our partnerships with wireless carriers for navigation will decline substantially as our agreement with sprint transitions to a predominantly freemium model and at t and t mobile continue to experience declines in subscribers paying monthly recurring charges for navigation applications 
we expect that over time  certain other wireless carrier partners will shift to models in which we are not compensated on a fixed basis for our services but instead share revenue received with them  whether that revenue is generated directly from monthly recurring charges for navigation services or from advertising in our navigation services 
in an effort to focus more and strengthen our strategic consumer  advertising and automotive business  on april  we closed the sale of our enterprise business to fleetcor technologies operating company  llc  or fleetcor  for approximately million in cash and the assumption by fleetcor of certain liabilities relating to our enterprise business 
our enterprise business enabled companies to better manage operations by using our navigation services platform to track status and the location of mobile workers  vehicles and assets deployed in the field 
in connection with the completion of the transaction  of our employees became employees of fleetcor 
we are providing certain services to fleetcor to facilitate the transition of the business and we expect to continue to provide those services in fiscal we entered into a three year noncompetition agreement with fleetcor in which we agreed not to re enter the enterprise business for a period of three years after the closing 
the results of operations of our enterprise business have been classified as discontinued operations in our statement of income for all periods presented 
all information in the following management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes only results from continuing operations excluding our enterprise business for all periods presented  unless otherwise noted 
key components of our results of operations sources of revenue 
table of contents we offer voice guided  real time  turn by turn  mobile navigation service under several brand names including scout by telenav and telenav gps as well as under wireless carrier brands or white label brands including sprint navigation  at t navigator and your navigator deluxe 
our technology also powers automotive navigation solutions that provide accurate  easy to use navigation services to drivers  including search  poi and traffic services 
we have introduced other navigation services solutions with new business models and distribution channels in our current market and adjacent markets  including premium navigation services 
while we have already introduced certain components or initial versions of several of these navigation services solutions  the scope and timing of broader and more commercially viable offerings is uncertain 
the ultimate scope and timing of any future releases are dependent on many factors  including adoption by wireless carrier customers  automobile manufacturers and oems of our navigation services  end user adoption and preferences  the quality  features and timing of our product offerings  the impact of competition  and market acceptance of mobile advertising 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to cover the costs of these anticipated efforts for the foreseeable future 
we offer our mobile navigation services to customers in a number of ways 
currently  we primarily derive our revenue from our wireless carrier customers for their end users subscriptions to our mobile navigation services  as well as from activation fees for certain of our services 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed annual fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
certain of our contracts provide our wireless carrier customers with discounts based on the number of end users paying for our services in a given month 
in general  our wireless carrier customers pay us a lower monthly fee per end user if an end user subscribes to our mobile navigation services as part of a bundle of mobile data or voice services than if an end user subscribes to our mobile navigation services on a standalone basis 
the majority of our end users receive access to our navigation application through bundled offerings 
we also offer our applications directly to end users through application stores such as the apple app store and the google play marketplace 
finally  we have implemented revenue models based on free versions of our services which can generate fees through advertising supported arrangements  and subscriber upgrades to more premium versions for a fee 
we derive revenue from the delivery of customized software products and royalties from the distribution of these software products in certain automotive navigation applications 
we also derive revenue from advertising network services through the delivery of search and display advertising impressions based on the specific terms of the advertising contract  which we began to offer in the three months ended december  with our acquisition of thinknear 
in the future  we may have other revenue models 
we classify our revenue as either product or services revenue 
product revenue consists primarily of revenue we receive from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications  services revenue consists primarily of revenue we derive from our mobile navigation services  off board automotive navigation services  mobile advertising and premium navigation services 
for services that our subscribers purchase through our wireless carriers  our wireless carrier customers are responsible for billing and collecting the fees they charge their subscribers for the right to use our navigation services 
with respect to sprint  through september   we will receive a guaranteed fixed fee from sprint for navigation applications provided to subscribers in bundles with other sprint services 
we recognize revenue for the aggregate fees monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
when we are paid on a revenue sharing basis with our wireless carrier customers  the amount we receive varies depending on several factors  including the revenue share rate negotiated with the wireless carrier customer  the price charged to the subscriber by the wireless carrier customer  the specific sales channel of the wireless carrier customer in which the service is offered and the features and capability of the service 
as a result of these factors  the amount we receive for a subscriber may vary considerably and is subject to change over time 
in addition  the amount we are paid per end user in our revenue sharing arrangements may also vary depending upon the metric used to determine the amount of the payment  including the number of end users at any time during a month  the average monthly paying end users  the number and timing of end user billing cycles and end user activity 
although our wireless carrier customers generally have sole discretion about how to price our mobile navigation services to their subscribers  our revenue sharing arrangements generally include monthly minimum fees per end user 
to a much lesser extent  we also sell our services directly to consumers through application stores 
ford represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we provide both on board and off board connected navigation solutions to ford 
our on board solution consists of software  map and poi data loaded in the vehicle that provides voice guided turn by turn navigation displayed on the vehicle screen 
we recognize revenue from our on board solutions as the related customized software is delivered to  and accepted by our customers 
in addition  we recognize royalties earned from our on board solutions generally as the software is reproduced for installation in vehicles 
our off board connected solution enables a mobile device that is paired with the vehicle to activate in vehicle text based and voice guided 
table of contents turn by turn navigation 
we recognize revenue from our off board connected solutions monthly based on annual subscriptions  which are subject to a maximum annual fee with ford 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on ford for a material portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
at t represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in march  our agreement with at t was automatically renewed  under its existing terms through march  and provides that we will continue to be the exclusive provider of white label gps navigation services to at t 
at t is not required to offer our navigation services 
we anticipate that we will continue to depend on at t for a material portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future  however  we have recently seen substantial declines in the number of paying subscribers for our services through at t 
sprint represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
we operate under an agreement with sprint  which we most recently amended in april under this amended agreement  we and sprint have agreed to continue the fixed fee arrangement related to the sprint bundle through september   and to partner to generate revenue from premium navigation and mobile advertising programs through december  sprint is not obligated to continue to bundle our navigation services after september   and even if sprint does continue to bundle we may not receive meaningful compensation for such distribution of our services 
we also anticipate that a majority of the sprint subscribers who are currently receiving our services through bundles will not convert to our paid navigation services 
subscription fees from our wireless carrier customers represented the majority of our revenue in fiscal  and subscription fee revenue from our mobile navigation service  excluding premium navigation services  represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
subscription fee revenue from our mobile navigation service declined from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to the transition to an extension of the fixed fee with sprint at a lower rate and a decrease in the number of paying subscribers for navigation services provided through at t and t mobile 
revenue from our automotive navigation solutions represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
revenue from our mobile advertising and premium navigation services represented  and of our revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we generated  and of our revenue  respectively  in the united states 
with respect to revenue we receive from automobile manufacturers and oems for sales of vehicles in other countries  we classify that revenue as being generated in the united states  because we provide deliverables to and receive compensation from the manufacturer or oem united states entity 
in absolute dollars  revenue from our international operations increased in fiscal we expect that the percentage of our revenue represented by wireless carrier customers will decline substantially in fiscal as sprint ceases to bundle our services for a fixed fee and more end users use our free or operating system affiliated navigation services 
we anticipate that we will not be successful in the short term at fully replacing lost wireless carrier revenue with revenue from automotive and advertising  resulting in a substantial decline in our total revenue in fiscal relative to prior years 
for fiscal  we expect automotive and advertising revenue to represent the most rapidly growing components of our revenue but our expectations may not be realized 
although we are working to replace historical wireless carrier revenue  we believe that the growth of alternative sources of revenue  while material  will be insufficient to offset the declines in wireless carrier revenue in the short term 
as a result  we expect to incur net losses in fiscal and possibly future periods 
cost of revenue our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of the third party content  such as map  poi  traffic  gas price and weather data and voice recognition technology that we use in providing our navigation services 
our cost of revenue also includes the cost of third party exchange display ad inventoryas well as expenses associated with data center operations  customer support  the amortization of capitalized software  recognition of deferred development costs on specific projects  stock based compensation and amortization of developed technology 
the largest component of our cost of revenue is the fee we pay to providers of map and poi data  tomtom and here 
we have long term agreements with tomtom and here pursuant to which we pay royalties according to a variety of different fee schedules  including on a per use basis  on a per end user per month basis and on a fixed fee basis 
with respect to both tomtom and here  we are required to pay certain minimum fees for access to their content by our mobile navigation customers 
for our on board navigation solutions provided to ford  we pay royalties on a per unit produced basis 
we classify our cost of revenue as either cost of product revenue or cost of services revenue 
cost of product revenue consists primarily of the cost of third party content we incur in providing our on board automotive navigation solutions and recognition of deferred development costs 
cost of services revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with third party content  data center operations  customer support  amortization of capitalized 
table of contents software  stock based compensation and amortization of developed technology that we incur in providing our navigation services  mobile advertising and premium navigation services 
we primarily provide mobile navigation service customer support through a third party provider to whom we provide training and assistance with problem resolution 
we use three outsourced  hosted data centers and industry standard hardware to provide our services 
we generally offer to our wireless carrier customers and generally maintain at least uptime every month  excluding designated periods of maintenance 
our internal targets for service uptime are even higher 
we have in the past  and may in the future  not achieve our targets for service availability and may incur penalties for failure to meet contractual service availability requirements  including loss of a portion of subscriber fees for the month or termination of our wireless carrier customer agreement 
while we expect that services revenue from wireless carrier customers will decline substantially in fiscal  we do not expect to be able to reduce our cost of services revenue at the same rate as services revenue  if at all 
we will continue to incur significant costs  especially third party content and data center operations costs  associated with providing our navigation services at reduced revenue rates or free under our freemium distribution model 
we expect that our total cost of revenue will increase as a percentage of revenue as we increase the percentage of our revenue from automotive navigation solutions  which generally have higher associated third party content costs than our navigation offerings provided through wireless carriers 
we expect that our cost of revenue will decrease in absolute dollars  as it will be impacted by declining third party content costs associated with the decline in revenue from wireless carrier customers  partially offset by increased amortization of developed technology acquired 
cost of revenue related to our advertising business will be impacted by our ability to grow advertising revenue  as well as the cost and availability of display ad inventory sourced from third party exchanges 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into three categories research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative 
in addition  in fiscal we incurred restructuring costs primarily related to severance and benefits expense associated with a reduction in workforce 
our operating expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  which include salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense 
other expenses include marketing program costs  facilities  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional service fees 
we allocate stock based compensation expense resulting from the amortization of the fair value of stock based awards granted  based on the department in which the award holder works 
we allocate overhead  such as rent and depreciation  to each expense category based on headcount 
our operating expenses have stabilized in absolute dollars in the past fiscal year  as we have reduced certain headcount and achieved greater operational effectiveness 
despite these recent efforts  we expect that certain costs will continue to increase over time  including compensation and related costs  however  we are continuing to evaluate spending in certain areas and taking actions to create greater efficiencies 
we anticipate continued investment of resources  including the hiring of additional headcount in  or reallocation of employee personnel into  our strategic growth areas 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our development employees and costs of outside consultants 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving the ease of use and functionality of our existing services  as well as developing new service and product offerings in our existing markets and in new markets 
a majority of our research and development employees are located in our development centers in china and  as a result  a portion of our research and development expense is subject to changes in foreign exchange rates  notably the chinese renminbi  or rmb 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our sales  product management and marketing staff  commissions earned by our sales personnel and the cost of marketing programs  advertising and promotional activities 
historically  a majority of our revenue has been derived from wireless carriers  which bear much of the expense of marketing and promoting our services to their subscribers 
as a result  the majority of our sales and marketing expenses relate to supporting our wireless carrier customers and attracting new automotive manufacturers  oem  and advertisers 
we expect to increase our investment in sales and marketing activities  in part  to support our initiatives in the automotive industry and mobile advertising and to promote our branded services directly to end users 
for example  we will add sales personnel to support our advertising business 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  legal  audit and tax consulting and other professional services and corporate expenses 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 

table of contents income from discontinued operations  net 
income from discontinued operations  net consists of results of operations of our enterprise business  which was sold in april provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes primarily consists of corporate income taxes related to profits earned in the united states 
our effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could be adversely affected by increases in nondeductible stock compensation or other nondeductible expenses 
our effective tax rate could also fluctuate due to a change in our earnings projections  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  changes in our ability to benefit from the carryback of net operating losses within the carryback period  or changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  as well as certain discrete items 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require our judgment in its application 
in other cases  our judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting policies that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could reasonably use different accounting estimates  and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will be affected 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving our judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenue primarily from service subscriptions  including premium offerings  fixed fee arrangements and software licenses 
we also generate revenue from the delivery of search and display advertising impressions 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the service or product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we derive our revenue primarily from subscriptions to access our mobile navigation services  which are generally provided through our wireless carrier customers that offer our services to their subscribers or through application stores 
our wireless carrier customers pay us based on several different revenue models  including a revenue sharing arrangement that may include a minimum fee per end user  a fixed fee for any number of subscribers up to specified thresholds receiving our services as part of bundles with other voice and data services  a monthly or annual subscription fee per end user  or based on usage 
our end users who subscribe to our services through application stores pay us a monthly or annual subscription fee 
we recognize monthly fees related to our mobile navigation services in the month we provide the services 
we defer amounts received in advance of the service being provided and recognize the deferred amounts when the monthly service has been provided 
we recognize revenue for fixed fees for any number of subscribers receiving our services as part of bundles monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
our agreements do not contain general rights of refund once the service has been provided 
we also establish allowances for estimated credits subsequently issued to end users by our wireless carrier customers 
we recognize as services revenue the amount our wireless carrier customers report to us as we provide our services  which are net of any revenue sharing or other fees earned and deducted by our wireless carrier customers 
we are not the principal provider when selling access to our mobile navigation services through our wireless carrier customers as the subscribers directly contract with our wireless carrier customers 
in addition  we may earn a fixed fee or fixed percentage of fees charged by our wireless carrier customers and our wireless carrier customers have the sole ability to set the price charged to their subscribers for our service 
our wireless carrier customers have direct responsibility for billing and collecting those fees from their subscribers and we and our wireless carrier customers may offer subscribers a day free trial for our service 
for end users who purchase our navigation services through application stores we utilize the application store billing process 
we provide tiered pricing to certain of our wireless carrier customers based on the number of paying end users in a given month  which may result in a discounted fee per end user depending on the number of end users 
revenue recognized is based on the discounted fees earned for a given period 

table of contents we also derive services revenue from the delivery of search and display advertising impressions 
we recognize revenue when the related advertising services are delivered based on the specific terms of the advertising contract  which are commonly based on the number of ad impressions delivered  or clicks  drives or actions by users on mobile advertisements 
we derive product revenue from the delivery of customized software and royalties earned from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
we generally recognize software customization revenue using the completed contract method of contract accounting under which revenue is recognized upon delivery to  and acceptance by  the automobile manufacturer of our on board navigation solutions 
we generally recognize royalty revenue as the software is reproduced for installation in vehicles  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
in certain instances  due to the nature and timing of monthly revenue and reporting from our customers  we may be required to make estimates of the amount of revenue to recognize from a customer for the current period 
for example  certain of our wireless carrier customers do not provide us with sufficient monthly individual subscriber billing period details to allow us to compute the allocation of monthly service fees to the individual end user s service period  and in such cases we make estimates of any required service period revenue cutoff 
in addition  if we fail to receive an accurate revenue report from a wireless carrier customer for the month  we will need to estimate the amount of revenue that should be recorded for that month 
these estimates may require judgment  and we consider certain factors and information in making these estimates such as subscriber data supplied by our wireless carrier customers  customer specific historical subscription and revenue reporting trends  end user subscription data from our internal systems  and data from comparable distribution channels of our other customers 
if we are unable to reasonably estimate recognizable revenue from a customer for a given period  we defer recognition of revenue to the period in which we receive and validate the customer s revenue report and all of our revenue recognition criteria have been met 
if we have recorded an estimated revenue amount  we record any difference between the estimated revenue and actual revenue in the period when we receive the final revenue reports from our customer  which typically occurs within the following month 
to date  actual amounts have not differed materially from our estimates 
software development costs 
we account for the costs of computer software we develop for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs  which are incurred during the application development stage  and amortizing those costs over the application s estimated useful life  which generally ranges from months to months depending on the type of application 
costs incurred and capitalized during the application development stage generally include the costs of software configuration  coding  installation and testing 
such costs primarily include payroll and payroll related expenses for employees directly involved in the application development  as well as third party developer fees 
we expense preliminary evaluation costs as they are incurred before the application development stage  as well as post development implementation and operation costs  such as training  maintenance and minor upgrades 
we begin amortizing capitalized costs when a project is ready for its intended use  and we periodically reassess the estimated useful life of a project considering the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors which may result in a shorter remaining life 
we capitalized million  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
amortization expense related to these costs  which was recorded in cost of revenue  totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we also account for the costs of computer software we develop for customers requiring significant modification or customization by deferring qualifying costs under the completed contract method 
all such development costs incurred are deferred until the related revenue is recognized 
we deferred million  million and million of software development costs during fiscal  and  respectively 
development costs expensed to cost of revenue totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of our property and equipment  long term investments and intangible assets with definite lives may not be recoverable 
our evaluation is significantly impacted by our estimates and assumptions of future revenue  costs  and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our property and equipment  that revision could result in a non cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
when these factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
we base the impairment  if any  on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows of those assets  and record it in the period in 
table of contents which we make the determination 
during fiscal and  we recorded a loss of  and  respectively  in connection with impairment in the carrying value of capitalized software 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these tests are based on our single operating segment and reporting unit structure 
we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
we are not required to calculate the fair value of our reporting unit unless we determine  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than our carrying amount 
if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we perform a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value exceeds its fair value  then we would perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting unit  we make assumptions regarding our estimated future cash flows  including estimate growth rate 
if our estimates or related assumptions change in the future  or if our net book value were to exceed our market capitalization  we may be required to record impairment loss related to our goodwill 
we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill in the three year period ended june  as of june   we had goodwill of million 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements under the fair value recognition method  which requires us to measure the stock based compensation costs of share based compensation arrangements based on the grant date fair value  and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the employees requisite service period 
we recognize compensation expense for the fair value of these awards with time based vesting on a straight line basis over an employee s requisite service period of each of these awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
our stock based compensation expense was as follows fiscal year ended june  in thousands cost of revenue research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total stock based compensation expense as of june   there was million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards  net of estimated forfeitures  that we expect to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
at june   the total unrecognized stock based compensation cost related to restricted stock units was million  net of estimated forfeitures  and will be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
we generally utilize the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  which requires a number of estimates and assumptions 
in valuing share based awards under the fair value accounting method  significant judgment is required in determining the expected volatility of our common stock and the expected term individuals will hold their share based awards prior to exercising 
the expected volatility of our stock is based on the historical volatility of various comparable companies  as we do not have sufficient historical data with regards to the volatility of our own stock 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term was based on an analysis of our historical exercise and cancellation activity 
in the future  as we gain historical data for volatility in our own stock  the expected volatility and expected term may change which could substantially change the grant date fair value of future awards of stock options and ultimately the expense we record 
in addition  the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as an adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
for fiscal  and  we calculated the fair value of options granted to employees with the following weighted average assumptions 
table of contents fiscal year ended june  expected volatility expected term in years risk free interest rate dividend yield provision for income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
in addition  we are subject to the periodic examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service  or irs  and other domestic and foreign tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of the current and any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets  on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  will be realized 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
results of operations the following tables set forth our results of operations for fiscal  and  as well as a percentage that each line item represents of our revenue for those periods 
the period to period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods

there was no change to total cost of revenue  gross profit or net income 
the results of operations of our enterprise business  including the related gain on sale  have been classified as discontinued operations in our statement of income for all periods presented

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue 
product revenue 
product revenue consists primarily of revenue we receive from the delivery of customized software and royalties from the distribution of this customized software in certain automotive navigation applications 
product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased revenue from automotive navigation solutions we provide for ford vehicles  including the launch of our solutions in additional ford and lincoln models 
in addition  product revenue in fiscal included million of customized engineering revenue received from ford 
services revenue 
services revenue consists primarily of revenue we derive from our mobile navigation services and mobile advertising 
services revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower revenue from sprint resulting from our july sprint amendment  which resulted in a significant reduction in our fixed fee revenue from sprint for bundled users beginning july   and lower subscription fees resulting from decreases in the number of paying subscribers for mobile navigation services provided through at t and t mobile 
these decreases were partially offset by growth in revenue from monetization of freemium offerings through wireless carriers and application stores and growth in mobile navigation revenue internationally 
accordingly  in fiscal  services revenue from sprint  at t and t mobile decreased by million  and the decrease was partially offset by an increase in services revenue of million driven by growth in monetization of freemium offerings and international 
revenue concentrations 
in fiscal and  ford represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
in fiscal and  revenue from at t represented and of our total revenue  respectively  and revenue from sprint represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
subscription fees from our mobile navigation service  excluding premium  represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from our automotive navigation solutions represented and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from our mobile advertising and premium navigation services represented  and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
we primarily sell our services in the united states 
in fiscal and  revenue derived from us sources represented and of our total revenue  respectively 
with respect to revenue we receive from automobile manufacturers and oems for sales of vehicles in other countries  we classify that revenue as being generated in the united states  because we provide deliverables to and receive compensation from the manufacturer or oem united states entity 
in absolute dollars  revenue from our international operations increased in fiscal cost of revenue 
cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was lower than the increase in product revenue 
our cost of product revenue increased due primarily to an increase in third party content costs of million  commensurate with the growth in our product revenue 
however  cost of product revenue increased at a lower rate than product revenue due primarily to the million of customized engineering revenue from ford  which had substantially lower associated costs as a percentage of revenue than our on board navigation revenue earned from ford for the sale of vehicles with our navigation products 
cost of services revenue 
our cost of services revenue was comparable at million in fiscal and million in fiscal cost of services revenue did not decline commensurate with the decrease in services revenue during fiscal cost of services revenue in fiscal was impacted by increased network operations and customer support costs of million and increased amortization expense of million  primarily related to the developed technology acquired from thinknear  that were offset by a decrease in third party content costs of million 
gross profit 
our gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our gross margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to lower services revenue from sprint and the increased proportion of product revenue contributed from our on board automotive navigation solutions provided to ford  which generally have higher associated content costs and resulting in lower gross margins than our mobile navigation services provided through our wireless carrier customers 
however  the higher content costs of product revenue in fiscal were partially offset by the higher gross margin we earned on the million of customized engineering revenue from ford 
we expect our gross margin to continue to decline as the percentage of our revenue from automotive navigation offerings increases  and as a result of increased competition on our offering of mobile navigation services  especially from other freemium offerings 
in addition  our gross margin will be negatively impacted in the future by the amortization of developed technology acquired as part of our acquisition of thinknear 

table of contents research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased compensation and benefits costs of million associated with decreased average headcount  primarily in our china offices 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the total number of research and development personnel decreased to at june  from at june  a substantial portion of the decrease in personnel occurred in june in conjunction with our restructuring efforts 
although research and development personnel have decreased in the short term  we expect research and development expenses will not reflect a proportionate decrease as we retain research and development personnel in higher cost geographic areas 
we also believe that as we continue to invest in expanding the navigation services we offer  establish relationships with new automotive manufacturers and oems and advertisers and develop new services and products  revenue from those investments and development efforts will lag the related research and development expenses 
we expect that research and development expenses will not change materially in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased advertising and promotion expenses of million  increased stock based compensation of million and increased recruiting expenses of million 
as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the total number of sales and marketing personnel decreased to at june  from at june  we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase over time in absolute dollars as we add sales personnel to support our advertising business 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to decreased legal costs of million  partially offset by increased compensation and benefits costs of million  increased stock compensation expense of million and professional services fees of million 
the total number of general and administrative personnel decreased to at june  from at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were comparable at in fiscal and we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may vary substantially from period to period as our legal expenses associated with ongoing intellectual property litigation and requests for indemnification related to intellectual property litigation proceed 
restructuring costs 
we incurred restructuring costs of million in fiscal in order to better align and focus our resources around our strategic growth areas 
we initiated a restructuring plan consisting of reductions of approximately full time positions in the us and china and we recorded restructuring charges of million related to severance and benefits for the positions eliminated 
in addition  we consolidated our shanghai office facilities and recorded restructuring charges of million related to the forfeiture of our lease deposit 
we also recorded restructuring charges of million related to the write off of certain assets that were no longer useful to us based upon the changes in our business 
other income  net 
our other income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was primarily due to decreased interest income due to lower cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
income from discontinued operations  net 
our income from discontinued operations  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal income from discontinued operations in fiscal includes a gain of million realized on the sale of our enterprise business  net of tax 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes  excluding discontinued operations  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal our effective tax rate  excluding discontinued operations  was in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was lower than the tax computed at the us federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to the r d credit and changes in intercompany arrangements  partially offset by nondeductible stock compensation 
the usage of our remaining us federal and state loss carryforwards of approximately million and million respectively  is substantially limited each fiscal year by section of the internal revenue code 
the federal limitation declines over time with an annual limitation of million for the next two years followed by a significant decrease in the annual limitation thereafter 
as of june   our cumulative unrecognized tax benefit was million  of which million was netted against deferred tax assets 
included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at june  was million of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the annual effective tax rate 
we file income tax returns with the internal revenue service  or irs  california  various states and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we have subsidiaries 
the statute of limitations remains open for fiscal through fiscal in the 
table of contents us  for fiscal through fiscal in state jurisdictions  and for fiscal through fiscal in foreign jurisdictions 
fiscal years outside the normal statute of limitations remain open to audit by tax authorities due to tax attributes generated in those early years which have been carried forward and may be audited in subsequent years when utilized 
we believed it is reasonably possible that  as of june   the gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease whether by payment  release  or a combination of both by as much as  in the next months 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our provision for income taxes 
we had  and  accrued for the payment of interest and penalties at june  and  respectively 
due to expected net losses in fiscal  we expect to record a tax benefit as we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of these losses due to our ability to carryback net operating losses within the carryback period 
on january   the president signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of under prior law  a taxpayer was entitled to a research tax credit for qualifying amounts paid or incurred on or before december  the taxpayer relief act extends the research credit for two years to december  the extension of the research credit is retroactive and includes amounts paid or incurred after december  the retroactive fiscal and fiscal benefits of million have been reflected in the fiscal effective tax rate 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue product revenue 
our product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased revenue from automotive navigation solutions we provide for ford vehicles  including the launch of our solutions in additional ford and lincoln models 
services revenue 
our services revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to decreases in revenue from sprint bundle users resulting from our september sprint amendment  whereby we transitioned to a fixed fee  and decreases in the number of paying subscribers for mobile navigation services provided through at t  t mobile and alltel  which has gradually discontinued offering our services in conjunction with its acquisition by verizon in early these decreases were partially offset by growth in monthly subscription fees from end users of our mobile navigation services provided through us cellular  growth in revenue from monetization of freemium offerings through wireless carriers and application stores  and growth in mobile navigation revenue internationally 
revenue concentrations 
in fiscal and  revenue from sprint represented and of our revenue  respectively  and revenue from at t represented and of our revenue  respectively

no other customer represented more than of our revenue in either period 
subscription fees from our gps navigator service represented and of our revenue in fiscal and  respectively

we primarily sell our services in the united states 
in fiscal and  revenue derived from us sources represented and of our revenue  respectively 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to a increase in third party content costs 
the increase in third party content costs was partially offset by a decrease in deferred development costs expensed  as fiscal included deferred development costs expensed in connection with revenue from ford 
our on board navigation revenue from ford generally has higher associated third party content costs than our mobile navigation services provided through wireless carriers 
cost of services revenue 
our cost of services revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was comparable to the decrease in services revenue 
gross profit 
our gross profit was comparable at million in fiscal and million in fiscal our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due to the increased proportion of revenue contributed from our on board navigation solutions provided to ford  which generally have higher associated content costs and resulting lower gross margins than our mobile navigation services provided through our wireless carrier customers 

table of contents research and development 
our research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the costs associated with increased compensation and benefits for our global employee base and increased us headcount to enhance the functionality of our services and develop new offerings 
we also incurred increased rent expense associated with our new sunnyvale facilities 
as a percentage of revenue  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the total number of research and development personnel decreased  from at june  to at june  the decrease was primarily due to the consolidation of our beijing and shanghai offices in may however  the number of us research and development personnel increased during the same period and average per employee costs in the united states remain higher than in china 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was primarily due to the costs associated with increased headcount to strengthen and diversify our product offerings  including automotive navigation solutions  premium services and advertising 
the total number of sales and marketing personnel increased  from at june  to at june  general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased legal costs and costs associated with higher compensation and benefits costs 
this was offset by slightly lower average headcount during the year 
legal costs included settlement of certain intellectual property litigation and increased legal fees for litigation and intellectual property protection 
the total number of general and administrative personnel decreased  from at june  to at june  as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal and in fiscal other income  net 
our other income  net was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the change was primarily due to increased interest income due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short term investments balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes  excluding discontinued operations  decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate  excluding discontinued operations  was in fiscal our effective tax rate of in fiscal was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of a favorable tax ruling from the state of california with respect to our apportionment method for our fiscal california income tax liability and the domestic manufacturing deduction  partially offset by the detriment of nondeductible stock compensation 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods set forth below fiscal year ended june  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents at june   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  which primarily consisted of money market mutual funds  municipal securities  corporate bonds and commercial paper held by well capitalized financial institutions 
our accounts receivable are heavily concentrated in a small number of customers 
as of june   our accounts receivable balance was million  of which ford and at t represented and  respectively 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our growth rate in fiscal and beyond  the timing and extent of expenditures to support development efforts  the expansion of research and development and sales and marketing activities and headcount  the introduction of our new and enhanced service and product offerings and the growth in our end user base 
we believe our cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to 
table of contents satisfy our financial obligations through at least the next months 
however  we expect to use cash in operating activities in fiscal and we may experience greater than expected cash usage in operating activities  revenue that is lower than we anticipate  or greater than expected cost of revenue or operating expenses 
our revenue and operating results could be lower than we anticipate if  among other reasons  our customers  two of which we are substantially dependent upon for a large portion of our revenue  were to limit or terminate our relationships with them  we were to fail to successfully compete in our highly competitive market  including against competitors who offer their services for free  our wireless carrier customers were to elect not to market and distribute our mobile navigation services to end users  or our wireless carrier customers were to elect to lower the prices charged to their subscribers for our service 
in the future  we may acquire businesses or technologies or license technologies from third parties  and we may decide to raise additional capital through debt or equity financing to the extent we believe this is necessary to successfully complete these acquisitions or license these technologies 
however  additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  at the time we make such determinations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and liquidity and cash position 
net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities has historically been affected by growth in our end user base and increases in our operating costs  which are primarily due to increased headcount and royalty payments for portions of the content provided in our services 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was provided principally by net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million  stock based compensation of million and a million change in our operating assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was generated principally by net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  partially offset by a million change in our operating assets and liabilities 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was provided principally by net income of million  non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million and million from changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
net cash used in investing activities 
we used net cash in investing activities of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  cash was used primarily for our acquisition of thinknear of million and purchases of property and equipment of million  which were offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments  net of purchases  of million 
in fiscal  the cash was used primarily for purchases of property and equipment of million million of which was related to tenant improvements in our new headquarters building  internal software development costs of million and net purchases of million of short term investments 
in fiscal  the cash was used primarily for purchases of property and equipment of million  internal software development costs of million and net purchases of million of short term investments 
we expect to increase our capital expenditures in future periods as we continue to invest in the infrastructure needed to operate our services for an increasing end user base 
net cash used in financing activities 
during fiscal  and  we used cash in our financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  and  repurchases of our outstanding stock under our stock repurchase programs were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of options for our common stock 
contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies we generally do not enter into long term minimum purchase commitments 
however  we have agreed to pay minimum annual license fees to certain of our third party content providers 
our principal commitments  in addition to those related to our third party content providers  consist of obligations under facility leases for office space in sunnyvale and culver city  california  northlake  washington  reston  virginia  southfield  michigan  boston  massachusetts  shanghai  china  xi an  china  and s o paulo  brazil 
the following table summarizes our outstanding noncancelable contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations consists of contractual obligations for office space under noncancelable operating leases  net of sublease income 

table of contents consists of minimum noncancelable financial commitments primarily related to fees owed to certain third party content providers  regardless of usage level 
at june   we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling million 
due to uncertainties related to these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of when cash settlements with the taxing authority will occur 
warranties and indemnifications our agreements with our customers generally include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if our navigation services or products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights or for other specified reasons 
we have in the past received indemnification requests or notices of their intent to seek indemnification in the future from our customers with respect to litigation in which our customers have been named as defendants 
see part i  item  legal proceedings 
as it relates to past indemnification requests or notices  in certain situations we have agreed to defend or indemnify our customers for the indemnity demands 
for those notices where we have not agreed to provide indemnity or defense to date  or future demands for indemnity  we may in the future agree to defend and indemnify our customers  irrespective of whether we believe that we have an obligation to indemnify them or whether we believe our navigation services and products infringe the asserted intellectual property rights 
alternatively  we may reject certain of our customers indemnity demands  including the outstanding demands  which may lead to disputes with our customers  negatively impact our relationships with them or result in litigation against us 
our customers may also claim that any rejection of their indemnity demands constitutes a material breach of our agreements with them  allowing them to terminate such agreements 
if  as a result of indemnity demands  we make substantial payments  our relationships with our customers are negatively impacted  or any of our customer agreements is terminated  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially harmed 
as of june   any costs in connection with such indemnity demands which are probable and estimable have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
we have agreed to indemnify our directors  officers and certain other employees for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while such persons are or were serving at our request in such capacity 
we may terminate the indemnification agreements with these persons upon the termination of their services with us  but termination will not affect claims for indemnification related to events occurring prior to the effective date of termination 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
we have a director and officer insurance policy that limits our potential exposure 
we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
we have not recorded any liabilities for these agreements as of june  off balance sheet arrangements during fiscal  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued amended guidance to require an entity to present total comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the amended guidance eliminates the current option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
we adopted this amendment retrospectively during the three months ended september   electing to present the required information in two separate but consecutive statements 
the adoption of this guidance affected financial statement presentation only and did not otherwise have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued a revised standard for testing goodwill for impairment 
the revised standard is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary 
we adopted this standard during the three months ended september  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued amended guidance to simplify the testing of indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment 
the amendment becomes effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning on or after september  and earlier adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued amended guidance on how to report the effect of significant reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the amendment becomes effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  for public entities and earlier adoption is permitted 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued amended guidance on the financial statement presentation of an unrecognized tax benefit when a net operating loss carryforward  a similar tax loss  or a tax credit carryforward exists 
the amendment becomes effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after december   and interim periods within those periods on a prospective basis to all unrecognized tax benefits that exist at the effective date and early adoption is permitted 
the result of adoption may result in the reclassification of certain long term liabilities to long term deferred tax assets  but the adoption will not result in a change to the tax provision 
the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing risk 
by policy  we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we invest in a variety of securities  which primarily consist of money market funds  commercial paper  municipal securities and other debt securities of domestic corporations 
due to the nature of these investments and relatively short duration of the underlying securities  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future interest income 
a appreciation or depreciation in interest rates in fiscal would not have had a material impact on our interest income or the fair value of our marketable securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue has been generated to date from our end users in the united states and  as such  our revenue has not been substantially exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
however  some of our contracts with our customers outside of the united states are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar and therefore expose us to foreign currency risk 
should the revenue generated outside of the united states grow in absolute amounts and as a percentage of our revenue  we will increasingly be exposed to foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the united states  are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the chinese renminbi  or rmb 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may cause us to recognize transaction gains and losses in our statement of income 
an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on foreign denominated receivables and payables as of june  would not have resulted in a material loss 
to date  we have not used any foreign currency forward contracts or similar instruments to attempt to mitigate our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates
