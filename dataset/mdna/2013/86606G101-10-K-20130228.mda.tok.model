description of business we are a billion community based financial services company providing a full range of banking and other financial services to individuals and businesses through our two operating segments community banking and insurance 
our community bank  summit community bank  has a total of banking offices located in west virginia and virginia 
in addition  we also operate an insurance agency  summit insurance services  llc with an office in moorefield  west virginia which offers both commercial and personal lines of insurance and two offices in leesburg  virginia  primarily specializing in group health  life and disability benefit plans 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for our segment information 
summit financial group  inc employs approximately full time equivalent employees 
overview our primary source of income is net interest income from loans and deposits 
business volumes tend to be influenced by the overall economic factors including market interest rates  business spending  and consumer confidence  as well as competitive conditions within the marketplace

we continue to manage our problem assets through a combination of asset sales  loan workouts and charge offs 
however  disposition of foreclosed real estate remains difficult to achieve as the return of our real estate markets to normal activity levels has been slow 
the impact of foregone net interest income from nonaccruing loans negatively impacted the margin keeping it well below historical margins 
we remained well capitalized by regulatory capital guidelines at december   with our leverage ratio at its highest level in six years and our total risk based capital ratio at its highest level in twelve years 

table of contents outlook summit remains well capitalized and is adequately reserved 
the company has adequate liquidity and is positioned to weather the current economic conditions and maintain marginal profitability until conditions improve 
in the short term  however  management anticipates the company will continue to be impacted by losses on loans and foreclosed properties  continuing elevated levels of nonperforming assets  a slow growing economy  and modest reductions in earning assets 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and follow general practices within the financial services industry 
application of these principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
our most significant accounting policies are presented in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  we have identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of goodwill  fair value measurements  and other real estate owned oreo valuations to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from our estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would negatively impact earnings in future periods 
note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included in the asset quality section of this financial review 
goodwill goodwill is subject to an analysis by reporting unit at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
initially  an assessment of qualitative factors step is performed to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
however  if we conclude otherwise  then we are required to perform the first step step of the two step impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  an expense may be required on our books to write down the goodwill to the proper carrying value 
step of impairment testing  which is necessary only if the reporting unit does not pass step  compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill for the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as goodwill that is recognized in a business combination 
community banking during third quarter  we performed the step assessment of our goodwill of our community banking reporting unit and determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value was less than its carrying value 
because we did not experience any significant adverse changes in our banking business or its reporting structure since our last step impairment test at september   we performed the qualitative step assessments 
in performing the qualitative step assessments  we considered certain events and circumstances such as macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount 
no indicators of impairment were noted as of september  
table of contents insurance services during third quarter  we performed the step assessment of our goodwill of our insurance services reporting unit 
we considered certain events and circumstances specific to the reporting unit  such as macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit is less than its carrying value and deemed it necessary to perform the further step impairment test 
we performed an internal valuation utilizing the income approach to determine the fair value of our insurance services reporting unit 
this methodology consisted of discounting the expected future cash flows of this unit based upon a forecast of its operations considering long term key business drivers such as anticipated commission revenue growth 
the long term growth rate used in determining the terminal value was estimated at  and a discount rate of was applied to the insurance services unit s estimated future cash flows 
we did not fail this step test as of september   therefore step testing was not necessary 
we cannot assure you that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
see note of the consolidated financial statements of our annual report on form k for further discussion of our intangible assets  which include goodwill 
fair value measurements asc topic fair value measurements provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is the price that could be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
based on the observability of the inputs used in the valuation techniques  we classify our financial assets and liabilities measured and disclosed at fair value in accordance with the three level hierarchy eg  level  level and level established under asc topic fair value determination in accordance with asc topic requires that we make a number of significant judgments 
in determining the fair value of financial instruments  we use market prices of the same or similar instruments whenever such prices are available 
we do not use prices involving distressed sellers in determining fair value 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
these modeling techniques incorporate our assessments regarding assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or the liability  including assumptions about the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique and the risk of nonperformance 
fair value is used on a recurring basis for certain assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting 
additionally  fair value is used on a non recurring basis to evaluate assets or liabilities for impairment or for disclosure purposes in accordance with asc topic  financial instruments 
deferred income tax assets at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
based on our ability to offset the net deferred tax asset against expected future taxable income in carryforward years  there was no impairment of the deferred tax asset at december  all available evidence  both positive and negative  was considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  impairment should be recognized 
however  our forecast process includes judgmental and quantitative elements that may be subject to significant change 
if our forecast of taxable income within the carryback carryforward periods available under applicable law is not sufficient to cover the amount of net deferred tax assets  such assets may become impaired

a summary of the significant factors influencing our results of operations and related ratios is included in the following discussion 
net interest income the major component of our net earnings is net interest income  which is the excess of interest earned on earning assets over the interest expense incurred on interest bearing sources of funds 
net interest income is affected by changes in volume  resulting from growth and alterations of the balance sheet composition  fluctuations in interest rates and maturities of sources and uses of funds 
we seek to maximize net interest income through management of our balance sheet components 
this is accomplished by determining the optimal product mix with respect to yields on assets and costs of funds in light of projected economic conditions  while maintaining portfolio risk at an acceptable level 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis average balance sheet amounts  and corresponding average yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities for the years  and are presented in table i 
table ii presents  for the periods indicated  the changes in interest income and expense attributable to a changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate and b changes in rate change in rate multiplied by prior period volume 
changes in interest income and expense attributable to both rate and volume have been allocated between the factors in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively  representing a decrease of in and an increase of in during and  the volumes of both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities declined 
during  these reductions were nearly offset by lower yields on both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities while during  these reductions were more than offset by lower yields on both interest earnings assets and interest bearing liabilities 
total average earning assets decreased to billion at december  from billion at december  total average interest bearing liabilities decreased to billion at december   compared to billion at december  as identified in table ii  tax equivalent net interest income decreased  in and increased  during our net interest margin was for compared to and for and  respectively 
our net interest margin increased basis points in and basis points in the continuing low interest rate environment throughout and has served to positively impact our net interest margin due to our liability sensitive balance sheet 
the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased and basis points for and  respectively  which more than offset the and basis point decreases in the yield on interest earning assets for the same periods 
see tables i and ii for further details regarding changes in volumes and rates of average assets and liabilities and how those changes affect our net interest income 
assuming no significant change in market interest rates  we anticipate a relatively stable net interest margin in the near term as we do not expect interest rates to rise in the near future  we do not expect significant growth in our interest earning assets  nor do we expect our nonperforming asset balances to decline significantly in the near future 
we continue to monitor the net interest margin through net interest income simulation to minimize the potential for any significant negative impact 
see the market risk management section for further discussion of the impact changes in market interest rates could have on us

asset quality due to continued weakened economic conditions  borrowers have in many cases been unable to refinance their loans due to a range of factors including reductions in property values 
as a result  we continue to experience elevated levels of loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets  particularly in regard to our construction development  residential real estate  and commercial real estate loan portfolios 
while recent economic data points to a stabilizing real estate market  in the near term  management anticipates loan delinquencies will remain higher than historical levels  and nonperforming assets will remain elevated

refer to note loans  for information regarding our past due loans  impaired loans  nonaccrual loans  and troubled debt restructurings 
we monitor our concentrations in higher risk lending areas in accordance with the interagency guidance for concentrations in commercial real estate lending issued in this guidance establishes concentration guidelines of of tier capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction  land development  and other land loans 
it further establishes a guideline of of tier capital plus the allowance for loan and lease loss for lending in construction  land development and other land loans plus loans secured by non owner occupied non farm non residential properties 
as of december   summit community bank was within the recommended limits of and  respectively 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is comprised of three distinct reserve components specific reserves related to loans individually evaluated  quantitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated  and qualitative reserves related to loans collectively evaluated 
a summary of the methodology we employ on a quarterly basis with respect to each of these components in order to evaluate the overall adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is as follows specific reserve for loans individually evaluated first  we identify loan relationships having aggregate balances in excess of  and that may also have credit weaknesses 
such loan relationships are identified primarily through our analysis of internal loan evaluations  past due loan reports  and loans adversely classified by regulatory authorities 
each loan so identified is then individually evaluated to determine whether it is impaired that is  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the underlying loan agreement 
substantially all of our impaired loans are and historically have been collateral dependent  meaning repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely from the sale of the loan s underlying collateral 
for such loans  we measure impairment based on the fair value of the loan s collateral  which is generally determined utilizing current appraisals 
a specific reserve is established in an amount equal to the excess  if any  of the recorded investment in each impaired loan over the fair value of its underlying collateral  less estimated costs to sell 
our policy is to re evaluate the fair value of collateral dependent loans at least every twelve months unless there is a known deterioration in the collateral s value  in which case a new appraisal is obtained 

table of contents quantitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated second  we stratify the loan portfolio into the following ten loan pools land and land development  construction  commercial  commercial real estate owner occupied  commercial real estate non owner occupied  conventional residential mortgage  jumbo residential mortgage  home equity  consumer  and other 
loans within each pool are then further segmented between loans which were individually evaluated for impairment and not deemed to be impaired  larger balance loan relationships exceeding million which are assigned an internal risk rating in conjunction with our normal ongoing loan review procedures and smaller balance homogenous loans 
quantitative reserves relative to each loan pool are established as follows for all loan segments detailed above an allocation equaling of the respective pool s average month historical net loan charge off rate determined based upon the most recent twelve quarters is applied to the aggregate recorded investment in the pool of loans 
qualitative reserve for loans collectively evaluated third  we consider the necessity to adjust our average historical net loan charge off rates relative to each of the above ten loan pools for potential risks factors that could result in actual losses deviating from prior loss experience 
for example  if we observe a significant increase in delinquencies within the conventional mortgage loan pool above historical trends  an additional allocation to the average historical loan charge off rate is applied 
such qualitative risk factors considered are levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans  levels of and trends in charge offs and recoveries  trends in volume and term of loans  effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards  and other changes in lending policies  procedures  and practice  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff  national and local economic trends and conditions  industry conditions  and effects of changes in credit concentrations 
relationship between allowance for loan losses  net charge offs and nonperforming loans in analyzing the relationship between the allowance for loan losses  net loan charge offs and nonperforming loans  it is helpful to understand the process of how loans are treated as they deteriorate over time 
reserves for loans are established at origination through the quantitative and qualitative reserve process discussed above 
charge offs  if necessary  are typically recognized in a period after the reserves were established 
if the previously established reserves exceed that needed to satisfactorily resolve the problem credit  a reduction in the overall level of the reserve could be recognized 
in summary  if loan quality deteriorates  the typical credit sequence is periods of reserve building  followed by periods of higher net charge offs 
consumer loans are generally charged off to the allowance for loan losses upon reaching specified stages of delinquency  in accordance with the federal financial institutions examination council policy 
for example  credit card loans are charged off by the end of the month in which the account becomes days past due or within days from receiving notification about a specified event eg  bankruptcy of the borrower  whichever is earlier 
residential mortgage loans are generally charged off to net realizable value no later than when the account becomes days past due 
other consumer loans  if collateralized  are generally charged off to net realizable value at days past due 
commercial related loans which are risk rated are charged off to the allowance for loan losses when the loss has been confirmed 
this determination includes many factors  including the prioritization of our claim in bankruptcy  expectations of the workout restructuring of the loan and valuation of the borrower s equity 

table of contents substantially all of our nonperforming loans are secured by real estate 
the substantial majority of these loans were underwritten in accordance with our loan to value policy guidelines which range from at the time of origination 
although property values have deteriorated across our market areas  the fair values of the underlying collateral value remains in excess of the recorded investment in many of our nonperforming loans  and therefore  no specific reserve allocation is required  as of december   approximately of our impaired loans required no reserves or have been charged down to their fair value 
accordingly  our allowance for loan losses has not increased proportionately as our nonperforming loans have increased 
the allowance for loan loss will  however  increase as a result of an increase in net loan charge offs due to the incremental higher historical net charge off rate applied to the loans which are collectively evaluated for impairment 
at december  and  our allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of total loans and million  or of total loans  respectively  and is considered adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio

although foreclosed property is recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell  the prices ultimately realized upon their sale may or may not result in us recognizing loss 
liquidity and capital resources bank liquidity liquidity reflects our ability to ensure the availability of adequate funds to meet loan commitments and deposit withdrawals  as well as provide for other transactional requirements 
liquidity is provided primarily by excess funds at correspondent banks  non pledged securities  and available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank fhlb  federal reserve bank of richmond and correspondent banks  which totaled approximately million or of total consolidated assets at december  our liquidity strategy is to fund loan growth with deposits and other borrowed funds while maintaining an adequate level of short and medium term investments to meet normal daily loan and deposit activity 
as a member of the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh  we have access to approximately million 
at december   we had available borrowing capacity of million through fhlb programs 
we also maintain a credit line with the federal reserve bank of richmond as a contingency liquidity vehicle 
the amount available on this line at december  was approximately million  which is secured by a pledge of our consumer and commercial and industrial loan portfolios 
we have a million unsecured line of credit with a correspondent bank 
also  we classify all of our securities as available for sale to enable us to liquidate them if the need arises 
during  our loans decreased approximately million  while total deposits increased milllion 
this net additional liquidity was used to reduce a similar amount of fhlb borrowings 
liquidity risk represents the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external market issues  customer or creditor perception of financial strength  and events unrelated to summit such as war  terrorism  or financial institution market specific issues 
the asset liability management committee alco  comprised of members of senior management and certain members of the board of directors  oversees our liquidity risk management process 
the alco develops and recommends policies and limits governing our liquidity to the board of directors for approval with the objective of ensuring that we can obtain cost effective funding to meet current and future obligations  as well as maintain sufficient levels of on hand liquidity  under both normal and stressed circumstances 
one aspect of our liquidity management process is establishing contingency liquidity funding plans under various scenarios in order to prepare for unexpected liquidity shortages or events 
the following represents three stressed liquidity circumstances and our related contingency plans with respect to each 
scenario summit community s capital status becomes less than well capitalized 
banks which are less than well capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines are prohibited from issuing new brokered deposits without first obtaining a waiver from the fdic to do so 
in the event summit community s capital status were to fall below well capitalized and was not successful in obtaining the fdic s waiver to issue new brokered deposits  summit community would have limited amounts of maturing brokered deposits to replace in the short term  as we have limited our brokered deposits maturing in any one quarter to no more than million 
presently has million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon to fund maturing brokered deposits until summit community had restored its capital to well capitalized status 
would first seek to restore its capital to well capitalized status through capital contributions from summit  its parent holding company 
would generally have no more than million in brokered deposits maturing in any one year time frame  which is well within its presently available sources of liquid funds  if in the event summit does not have the capital resources to restore summit community s capital to well capitalized status 
one year would give summit community ample time to raise alternative funds either through retail deposits or the sale of assets  and obtain capital resources to restore it to well capitalized status 
scenario summit community s credit quality deteriorates such that the fhlb restricts further advances 
if in the event that the bank s credit quality deteriorated to the point that further advances under its line with the fhlb were restricted  summit community would severely curtail lending and other growth activities until such time as access to this line could be restored  thus eliminating the need for net new advances 
would still have available current liquid funding sources secured by unemcumbered loans and securities totaling million aside from its fhlb line  which would result in a funding source of approximately million 

table of contents scenario a competitive financial institution offers a retail deposit program at interest rates significantly above current market rates in the summit community s market areas 
if a competitive financial institution offered a retail deposit program at rates well in excess of current market rates in the summit community s market area  the bank presently has million in available sources of liquid funds which could be drawn upon immediately to fund any net run off of deposits from this activity 
would severely curtail lending and other growth activities so as to preserve the availability of as much contingency funds as possible 
would begin offering its own competitive deposit program when deemed prudent so as to restore the retail deposits lost to the competition 
we continuously monitor our liquidity position to ensure that day to day as well as anticipated funding needs are met 
we are not aware of any trends  commitments  events or uncertainties that have resulted in or are reasonably likely to result in a material change to our liquidity 
growth and expansion during  we spent approximately million on capital expenditures for premises and equipment 
we expect our capital expenditures to approximate million in  primarily for equipment upgrades 
management anticipates that the company s near term level of assets will remain stable or even decline slightly in comparison with that of the prior year due to an expected continued slowly growing economy 
capital compliance our capital position has significantly improved 
this is primarily attributable to an increase in retained earnings due to our return to profitability in  a decline in total assets  and various capital raises over the past four years 
stated as a percentage of total assets  our equity ratio was and at december  and  respectively 
at december   we had tier risk based  total risk based and tier leverage capital in excess of the minimum levels required to be considered well capitalized of million  million  and million  respectively 
our subsidiary bank  summit community bank  had tier risk based  total risk based and tier leverage capital in excess of the minimum well capitalized levels of million  million  and million  respectively 
we intend to maintain both summit s and its subsidiary bank s capital ratios at levels that would be considered to be well capitalized in accordance with regulatory capital guidelines 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our regulatory capital 
during  we issued million in subordinated debentures  of which million was issued to an affiliate of a director of summit 
we also issued million and million to two unrelated parties 
these three issuances bear an interest rate of percent per annum  have a term of years  and are not prepayable by us within the first five years 
during  we issued million of subordinated debentures 
this debt has an interest rate of month libor plus basis points  a term of years  and is not prepayable by us within the first two and a half years 
these subordinated debentures qualify as tier capital until they are within years of maturity  thereafter the amount qualifying as tier capital is reduced by percent each year until maturity 
on september   we issued million of non cumulative convertible preferred stock and during fourth quarter  we issued an additional million of non cumulative convertible preferred stock 
issuance of trust preferred securities under federal reserve board guidelines  we had the ability to issue an additional million of trust preferred securities as of december  that would qualify as tier regulatory capital to support our future growth 
trust preferred securities issuances in excess of this limit generally may be included in tier capital 
dividends there were no cash dividends paid on common shares in or future cash dividends will depend on the earnings  and financial condition of our subsidiary bank and our capital adequacy as well as general economic conditions 
as discussed below under regulatory matters  we are presently restricted from paying cash dividends on our common stock 
the primary source of funds for the dividends paid to our shareholders is dividends received from our subsidiary bank 
dividends paid by our subsidiary bank are subject to restrictions by banking law and regulations and require approval by the bank s regulatory agency if dividends declared in any year exceed the bank s current year net income  as defined  plus its retained net profits of the two preceding years 
presently  as a result of the current bank mou  the bank is required to give days prior written notice of its intent to pay any cash dividends to its regulatory authorities to give regulatory authorities an opportunity to object 

table of contents regulatory matters summit and the bank have entered into informal memoranda of understanding mou s with their respective regulatory authorities 
a memorandum of understanding is characterized by the regulatory authorities as an informal action that is not published or publicly available and that is used when circumstances warrant a milder form of action than a formal supervisory action  such as a formal written agreement or order 
among other things  under the mou s  summit s management team has agreed to the bank achieving and maintaining a minimum tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least the bank providing days prior notice of any declaration of intent to pay cash dividends to provide the bank s regulatory authorities an opportunity to object  summit suspending all cash dividends on its common stock until further notice 
dividends on all preferred stock  as well as interest payments on subordinated notes underlying summit s trust preferred securities  continue to be permissible  and  summit not incurring any additional debt  other than trade payables  without the prior written consent of the principal banking regulators 
on october   the bank entered into a revised mou bank mou which replaced the bank mou effective september  and subsequently amended on february  in general  the bank mou includes provisions substantially similar to those in the prior bank mou with the exception that several provisions deemed no longer applicable by the regulatory authorities were removed and a provision relative to reducing the bank s levels of classified assets was added 
in summary  we have agreed  among other things  to address the following matters relative to the bank maintaining a board committee which monitors and promotes compliance with the provisions of the bank mou  providing the bank s regulatory authorities with updated reports of criticized assets and or formal workout plans for all nonperforming borrower relationships with an aggregate outstanding balance exceeding million  developing and submitting to regulatory authorities a written plan to reduce the bank s risk exposure in each adversely classified credit relationship in excess of million and all oreo  establishing procedures to report all loans with balances exceeding  that have credit weaknesses or that fall outside of the bank s policy  annually reviewing the organizational structure and operations of the bank s loan department  maintaining an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses through charges to current operating income  reviewing overall liquidity objectives and developing and submitting to regulatory authorities plans and procedures aimed to improve liquidity and reduce reliance on volatile liabilities  preparing comprehensive budgets and earnings forecasts for the bank and submitting reports comparing actual performance to the budget plan  maintaining a minimum tier leverage capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least  not paying any cash dividends without the prior written consent of the banking regulators  and  providing quarterly progress reports to the bank s regulatory authorities detailing steps taken to comply with the bank mou 
management presently believes summit and the bank are in compliance with all provisions of the mous

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  exchange rates and equity prices 
interest rate risk is our primary market risk and results from timing differences in the repricing of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  changes in relationships between rate indices and the potential exercise of embedded options 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to minimize interest rate risk and our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of our asset liability management committee alco 
the alco is comprised of members of senior management and members of the board of directors 
the alco actively formulates the economic assumptions that we use in our financial planning and budgeting process and establishes policies which control and monitor our sources  uses and prices of funds 
some amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate to the banking business 
our net income is affected by changes in the absolute level of interest rates 
at december   our interest rate risk position was liability sensitive 
that is  liabilities are likely to reprice faster than assets  resulting in a decrease in net interest income in a rising rate environment  while a falling interest rate environment would produce an increase in net interest income 
net interest income is also subject to changes in the shape of the yield curve 
in general  a flat yield curve results in a decline in our earnings due to the compression of earning asset yields and funding rates  while a steepening would result in increased earnings as margins widen 
several techniques are available to monitor and control the level of interest rate risk 
we primarily use earnings simulations modeling to monitor interest rate risk 
the earnings simulation model forecasts the effects on net interest income under a variety of interest rate scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates and changes in the shape of the yield curve 
each increase or decrease in rates is assumed to gradually take place over a month period  and then remain stable  except for the up scenario  which assumes a gradual increase in rates over months 
assumptions used to project yields and rates for new loans and deposits are derived from historical analysis 
securities portfolio maturities and prepayments are reinvested in like instruments 
mortgage loan prepayment assumptions are developed from industry estimates of prepayment speeds 
noncontractual deposit repricings are modeled on historical patterns 
the following table presents the estimated sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in interest rates  as measured by our earnings simulation model as of december  the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income given the stated changes in interest rates gradual change over months  stable thereafter for the down and the up scenarios  and gradual change over months for the up scenario compared to net interest income with rates unchanged in the same period 
the estimated changes set forth below are dependent on the assumptions discussed above and are well within our alco policy limit  which is a reduction in net interest income over the ensuing twelve month period 
estimated change in net change in interest income over interest rates months months down basis points up basis points up basis points assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve over months assumes a parallel shift in the yield curve over months
