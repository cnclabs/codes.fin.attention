item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out in part i general information  item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our business we are a leading provider of videogame accessories  pc game accessories  pc input devices  multimedia audio products  chess and intelligent games and videogames primarily marketed under the mad catz  saitek  tritton and airdrives brands 
we also produce for selected customers a limited range of products marketed on a private label basis 
we design  manufacture through third parties in asia  sell  market and distribute accessories for all major videogame platforms  the pc and mac and  smart phones and other smart devices 
our products include control pads  steering wheels  joysticks  memory cards  video cables  light guns  dance pads  microphones  car adapters  carry cases  mice  keyboards and headsets 
we also develop flight simulation software through our internal thunderhawk studios tm 
we also publish videogames 
seasonality and fluctuation of sales we generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year  our fiscal third quarter 
our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the introduction of new videogame platforms  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and timing of introductions of new products 
see further discussion and sales by quarter under net sales below 
foreign currency in fiscal  approximately of our annual sales were transacted outside the united states 
the majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
to date we have not hedged against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us in the future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when each of the following have occurred there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the products are deliv ered  which generally occurs when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  
table of contents the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed reasonably assured 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 
all of our arrangements are single element arrangements and there are no undelivered elements after the point of shipment 
customer marketing programs where applicable  we record allowances for customer marketing programs  including certain rights of return  price protection  volume based cash incentives and cooperative advertising 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as a reduction to revenue or as an operating expense in the period we sell the product or commit to the program 
such amounts are estimated  based on historical experience and contractual terms  and periodically adjusted based on historical and anticipated rates of returns  inventory levels and other factors and are recorded as either operating expenses or a reduction of sales in accordance with authoritative guidance 
we grant limited rights of return for certain products 
estimates of expected future product returns are based on analyses of historical returns and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
consistent with industry standards and practices  on a product by product basis by customer  we allow price protection credits to be issued to retailers in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the price of a product and issue credits to our customers to protect the customers from lower profit margins on their then current inventory of the product 
the decision to effect price reductions is influenced by retailer inventory levels  product lifecycle stage  market acceptance  competitive environment and new product introductions 
credits are issued based upon the number of units that customers have on hand at the date of the price reduction 
upon approval of a price protection program  reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established 
reserves are estimated based on analyses of qualified inventories on hand with retailers and distributors 
we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with many of our customers allowing customers to receive a credit for various advertising programs 
the amounts of the credits are based on specific dollar value programs or a percentage of sales  depending on the terms of the program negotiated with the individual customer 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these advertising programs are recorded based on the specific negotiations with individual customers in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of these cooperative advertising program accruals 
we also offer volume rebates to several of our customers and record reserves for such rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue is recognized 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on programs negotiated with the specific customers 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase customer programs and incentive offerings that could result in incremental reductions to revenue or increased operating expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products in the united states and internationally primarily through retailers 
we generally do not require any collateral from our customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and by purchasing credit insurance on european accounts receivable balances 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which we believe is adequate 
the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as historical experience with bad debts  receivables aging and current economic trends 
our customer base is highly concentrated and a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition  or a decline in the general economic conditions could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
as of march   one customer represented of total accounts receivable 

table of contents customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivables as of march  if any of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost of the inventory  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
determination of the market value may be complex  and therefore  requires management to make assumptions and to apply a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  inventory quantities on hand in our facilities and customer inventories  unfilled customer order quantities  forecasted consumer demand  current retail prices  competitive pricing  seasonality factors  consumer trends and performance of similar products or accessories 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology or assumptions used to establish our inventory reserves as reported during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a significant change in the future methodology or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate  or changes in consumer demand affect specific products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional increases in our inventory reserves that could be material 
valuation of goodwill we perform an annual impairment review at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
authoritative guidance requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill  using a combination of the income approach using discounted future cash flows and the market valuation approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill based on a number of factors  including the implied discount rate  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
during the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization declined to a point below our book equity value 
as a result  we completed the first step of our goodwill impairment testing  which indicated that the fair value of our reporting unit was lower than its carrying value 
the decrease in value was due to lower projected near term growth rates in the gaming industry  lowering the anticipated growth trend used for goodwill impairment testing 
we recognized a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on the fair value analysis 
share based payments we measure stock based compensation cost at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and recognize it as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the expected life of the options is based on a number of factors  including historical exercise experience  the vesting term of the award  the expected volatility of our stock 
the expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility using daily pricing of our stock 
the risk free interest rate is determined on a constant us treasury security rate with a contractual life that approximates the expected term of the stock 
table of contents options 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  we reduce the calculated black scholes value by applying a forfeiture rate  based upon historical pre vesting option cancellations 
estimated forfeitures are reassessed at each balance sheet date and may change based on new facts and circumstances 
valuation of deferred income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we were to determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would reverse the valuation allowance which would be reflected as an income tax benefit or as an adjustment to stockholders equity  for tax assets related to stock options 
as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the company s net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty over future profitability as well as the fact that the company remains in a three year cumulative book pre tax loss position in the us  the company has continued to record a valuation allowance against its us deferred tax assets 
the company has worldwide gross deferred tax assets of approximately million as of march  the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of its net deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis to identify whether any significant changes in circumstances or assumptions have occurred that could materially affect the realizability of deferred tax assets and expects to release the valuation allowance when it has sufficient positive evidence  including but not limited to cumulative earnings in successive recent periods  to overcome such negative evidence 
in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our uncertain tax positions in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues and require us to make judgments about the likely application of the tax law to our situation  as well as with respect to other matters  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
the ultimate resolution of these issues may take extended periods of time due to examinations by tax authorities and statutes of limitations 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result

we expect general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal to slightly increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses include the costs of developing and enhancing new and existing products in addition to the costs of developing games 
the decrease in research and development expenses is primarily due to reduced research and development activities related to our videogames  accessories and peripherals products  specifically a new line of tritton headsets and the videogame damage  inc  which was released in august we expect research and development expenses in fiscal to decrease slightly  on an absolute dollar basis  from fiscal levels

liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity our primary ongoing cash requirements are for product development  operating activities  capital expenditures  debt service  and acquisition opportunities that may arise

there also can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain waivers from wells fargo to the extent we are not in compliance with this or any other covenant in the credit facility 
we believe that our available cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our operating needs for at least the next twelve months 
also  we operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we may not be required to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or from additional credit facilities 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  additional debt financing may contain more restrictive covenants than our existing debt
