item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein 
important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward looking statements in this annual report 
in assessing forward looking statements contained herein  readers are urged to read carefully all risk factors and cautionary statements contained in this annual report 
further  we operate in an industry sector where securities prices are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics primarily to treat cancer 
our primary focus is the development of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents  or vdas  that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival  and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions 
we have product candidates in the development stage in three areas  zybrestat in oncology  oxi in oncology and zybrestat in ophthalmology 
our primary focus has been our zybrestat in oncology program 
since the fall of  we have focused our capital resources on our most promising early stage clinical programs with the goal of reducing our cash utilization 
accordingly  our resources have been focused primarily on supporting our ovarian phase clinical trial which is being conducted by the gynecological oncology group  or gog  our acute myeloid leukemia  or aml phase clinical trial being conducted by the university of florida  our distribution agreement with azanta  preclinical programs and the manufacture of clinical supply of our product candidates to support our programs 
we have also spent resources completing our atc trial fact trial and designing a phase registrational study in anaplastic thyroid cancer  or atc fact trial  and while we were successful in receiving a spa with the fda for the fact trial  we have subsequently determined that this trial is not financially feasible at this time with our limited financial resources 
we are now focusing our efforts in this area on pursuing the commercialization of zybrestat in europe for the treatment of atc with a marketing authorization under exceptional or conditional circumstances 
we had previously undertaken clinical trials in atc fact  a phase trial that enrolled patients and in non small cell lung cancer falcon  a patient phase trial  as well as other  smaller studies in solid 
table of contents tumors  ovarian cancer and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy 
on february  we announced a restructuring designed to focus our resources on our highest value clinical assets and reduce our cash utilization 
as a part of this restructuring we stopped enrollment of additional patients in the fact trial and reduced our work force by approximately employees 
we have concluded these clinical trials  which is the primary reason for the reduction in our expenses in and as compared to we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project by project basis 
we conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
financial resources we have experienced net losses every year since our inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a significantly lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no recurring material amount of licensing or other income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and restricted cash 
currently  we have two potential vehicles for raising capital as described in detail in note to the financial statements for the year ended december  and in liquidity below 
in summary  subject to a minimum purchase price of per share and other conditions of the arrangement  we may sell up to a total of  of our common stock to lincoln park capital fund  llc  or lpc  pursuant to a stock purchase agreement  the lpc purchase agreement  the price of our common stock as of march  was and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time 
we also have entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement  or the atm agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of common stock from time to time through mlv acting as our sales agent and underwriter 
the company is limited as to how many shares it can sell under the atm agreement due to limitations imposed by the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a form s registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the company 
as of march  the total dollar amount of common stock that the company could sell under the atm agreement during the next twelve months is approximately  under its current registration statement 
the company may be able to sell more shares under this agreement over the next twelve months depending on several factors including the company s stock price  number of shares outstanding and when the sales take place 
based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and the reductions in cash utilization resulting from our september reduction in work force  we expect our existing cash to support our operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of however  this level of cash utilization does not allow us to initiate any significant projects  including clinical trials  to further the development of our most advanced product candidates  primarily zybrestat 
any significant further development of zybrestat or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements  as to which we can give you no assurance 
we will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates 
such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to access additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue the development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
any additional equity financing  which may not be available to us or may not be available on favorable terms  most likely will be dilutive to our current stockholders and debt financing  if available  may 
table of contents involve restrictive covenants 
if we access funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize on our own  on terms that are not favorable to us 
our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and  if not achieved on a timely basis  will materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
license agreements on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  manufacture  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the carrying value is being amortized over the term of the license approximately years 
management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long lived assets if triggering events occur 
we review for such triggering events  including triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing operating losses  periodically 
in addition  the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement 
we expense these payments to research and development in the period that payment becomes both probable and estimable 
share based compensation we record the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model  which requires certain input assumptions 
we estimate the expected term of options based on an analysis of historical behavior of participants over time 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
we are required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
accordingly  we perform a historical analysis of option awards that are forfeited prior to vesting  and record total stock option expense that reflects this estimated forfeiture rate 
revenue recognition in december  we established a distribution agreement with azanta danmark a s  or azanta  to provide access to zybrestat for the treatment of patients with atc on a compassionate use basis in certain specified territories 
the program which is managed by azanta provides a regulatory mechanism to allow 
table of contents healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe zybrestat to individual atc patients while it is still in development 
our agreement with azanta provides that upon the receipt of zybrestat by azanta for distribution and sale to compassionate use patients  azanta has days to inspect the product for defects and to ensure that the product conforms to the warranties made by us 
if azanta does not notify us of any defective product within the day period it will be deemed to have accepted the product 
revenue is recognized based on product accepted at the conclusion of the day inspection period 
azanta will also pay to us  on a quarterly basis  an amount equal to of azanta s gross margin  as defined in the agreement  on its sales in the preceding quarter 
this revenue will be recognized upon notification from azanta of the gross margin earned 
currently  the company s drug is expensed as manufactured  since it is still in development 
as a result  the product provided to the azanta has a zero cost basis  and therefore there is no cost of goods sold 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues we recognized approximately  in product revenue for the year ended december  as compared to in the years ended december  and revenues in represent amounts recognized under our distribution agreement with azanta which was established in december we recognized approximately  of product revenues in  after delivery of our drug for compassionate use to azanta and the day inspection period had expired at which point the drug was deemed accepted 
additionally  we recognized approximately  as payment for of azanta s gross margin  as defined in the agreement  on its sales in the preceding quarter  in  after azanta notified us of the amount 
in  we expect approximately the same levels of revenue as  although there can be no assurance of this and at this time  we have no future firm orders from azanta 
our drug was expensed in the period it was manufactured  since it is in the development stage and does not have an alternative future use 
as a result  the product provided to azanta had a zero cost basis  and therefore there is no cost of goods sold 
our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to  and generate revenues from  products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in the near term future  unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up front payments 
research and development expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands  and provides the amount and percentage change in these components change change years ended december  versus versus amount amount external services employee compensation and related employee stock based compensation other total research and development research and development expenses decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended and decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended as we have completed many of our clinical programs over the last two to three years and focused our efforts 
table of contents on our most promising early stage clinical programs 
the clinical programs we have completed include trials in our zybrestat for oncology program  including those we conducted in anaplastic thyroid cancer and non small cell lung cancer and to a lesser extent clinical trials in our oxi program and our zybrestat for ophthalmology program 
in  these reductions in costs were offset in part by increased costs of supporting our ovarian clinical trial being conducted by the gog and the cost of manufacturing clinical drug supplies 
external services include clinical research organizations  clinical site services  labs  clinical manufacturing and many other outside services 
the reduction in these expenses in the two years ended december  and are due to the completion of the clinical trials as referenced above 
employee compensation and related expenses include employee compensation  temporary help  employee benefits and travel 
the reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the two years ended december  and is primarily due to the reduction of research and development programs as noted above and associated restructuring and reduction of staff for the decreased level of activity 
employee stock based compensation expense decreased for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the reduction in headcount  this amount can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants 
employee stock based compensation expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  due primarily to the due to the timing and vesting of option grants 
other expenses include facility expenses and licensing fees and amortization 
other expenses have increased in the year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended  primarily due to a license fee we expensed in the fiscal year 
the reduction in other expenses in the year ended december  compared to is primarily due to a reduction in both our research and development facility related costs as well as program wide support costs for the comparable periods 
we continue to evaluate next steps in the development of our clinical programs 
as a result  research and development expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the fiscal year 
we plan to begin new clinical trials in our oncology program  however  these studies are dependent upon receiving funding 
if we should receive funding  then research and development expenses will increase 
general and administrative expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands  and the amount and percentage change in these components change change years ended december  versus versus amount amount employee compensation and related employee stock based compensation consulting and professional services other total general and administrative employee compensation and related expenses decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the fiscal year ended due primarily to a restructuring and reduction in headcount in september for the year ended december   this cost reduction was slightly offset by additional costs in the first quarter of related to the transition of consolidating our massachusetts administrative offices  including our finance employees  to our california headquarters 
the reduction in employee compensation and related expenses for the year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended is due primarily to a reduction in our average full time equivalents for the comparable period 

table of contents employee stock based compensation expense decreased in fiscal years ended december  and compared to the respective prior fiscal years  due in part to the reduction in headcount but can also vary significantly from period to period due to the timing and vesting of option grants 
consulting and professional services expenses increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to administrative  legal and investor relations costs  in part due to our reverse stock split  and board fees which increased due to a revised board compensation policy 
the reduction in consulting and professional services expenses for the year ended december  compared to the fiscal year ended is primarily due to one time costs incurred in in connection with certain transactions 
in addition  we experienced lower board member compensation expense attributable to lower stock valuations during the first half of the period as a portion of fees to board members were paid in the form of non cash stock awards 
also  we recognized lower legal  accounting and service provider expenses due to fewer significant transactions during the period 
other expenses decreased in the year ended december  as compared to due primarily to a reduction in facility related costs  including insurance 
other expenses increased in the year ended december  as compared to due primarily to an increase in delaware franchise tax fees 
we continue to evaluate general and administrative expense and look for ways to decrease such costs 
if we receive funding  as discussed above  we may begin new clinical trials in which case general and administrative expenses could increase in support of research and development activities 
as a result  general and administrative expenses in the future could vary significantly from those incurred in the fiscal year 
restructuring we recorded a restructuring charge of  in the year ended december  and recorded net adjustments to the charge of  in the year ended december  this charge was a result of a restructuring plan announced on september   which included a reduction in work force  and was designed to focus our capital resources on our most promising early stage clinical programs and further reduce our cash utilization 
the restructuring is complete and the expenses in are reflective of the reductions in expense as a result of the restructuring 
other income and expenses the table below summarizes the components of other income and expense for the periods indicated  in thousands years ended december  change in fair value of warrants investment income other income expense  net total we recorded an unrealized non cash gain in the years ended december  and and an unrealized non cash loss in the year ended december  as a result of the change in the estimated fair market value of our common stock warrants issued in connection with the offerings of our common stock

additionally  the future utilization of the us net operating loss carry forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
the valuation allowance decreased by approximately  and approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in research and development credit carry forwards offset in part by the increase in federal and state net operating loss carry forwards 
for the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to the decrease in the net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financings and through a strategic development arrangement with symphony capital partners  lp  which concluded in we have experienced negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception  except in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to continue to incur increased expenses  resulting in losses  over at least the next several years due to  among other factors  our continuing and planned clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities

net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  is primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the sale of common stock pursuant to the atm agreement discussed below 
on january   we entered into separate warrant exchange agreements with each of the holders of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock issued in march  pursuant to which  at the initial closing  the warrant holders exchanged their outstanding series a and series c warrants having ratchet price based anti dilution protections for a an aggregate of  shares of common stock and b series e warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the series e warrants were not exercisable for six months  had an exercise price of per share reflecting the market value of the shares of common stock as of the close of trading on january   prior to the entry into the warrant exchange agreements  and did not contain any price based anti dilution protections 
in addition  we agreed to seek shareholder approval to issue up to  additional shares of common stock to the warrant holders in a subsequent closing 
such shareholder approval was obtained on march   and the series e warrants issued at the initial closing were exchanged for the additional  shares of common stock 
in november  we entered into a purchase agreement  the lpc purchase agreement  for the sale  from time to time  of up to  of our common stock to lincoln park capital fund  llc  or lpc  a chicago based institutional investor 
we do not have the ability to sell shares under this arrangement if we fail to maintain a minimum stock price of or if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the price of our common stock as of march  was and therefore the facility is not available to us at this time 
if our stock price rises above and the other conditions of the arrangement are met  we could direct lpc to purchase up to  worth of shares of our common stock under our agreement over a month period  in amounts of up to  which amounts may be increased under certain circumstances 
during the month term of the lpc purchase agreement  we control the timing and amount of any sales to lpc  if and when we decide  in accordance with the lpc purchase agreement 
lpc has no right to require us to sell any shares to lpc  but lpc is obligated to make purchases as we direct  subject to certain conditions  which include the continuing effectiveness of a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission covering the resale of the shares that may be issued to lpc and limitations related to the market value of our common stock

table of contents market prices of our shares immediately preceding the notice of sale to lpc without any fixed discount 
the lpc purchase agreement may be terminated by us at any time  at our sole discretion  without any cost or penalty 
we are unable to use this agreement at any time when the price to lpc of the shares of our common stock would be less than per share 
assuming that the purchase price per share is or greater  the total dollar amount of common stock that we could sell under the lpc purchase agreement during the next twelve months is approximately  provided that we would be required to file and have declared effective an additional registration statement in order to sell more than an additional  shares of our common stock under the lpc purchase agreement 
in connection with the lpc purchase agreement  we issued  shares of common stock for proceeds of approximately  net of issuance costs  during the year ended december  including  shares issued as a commitment fee 
additionally  in connection with the lpc agreement  we issued approximately  shares of common stock as its initial commitment fee in november we issued no other shares under this agreement during the year ended december  on july   we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement  or atm agreement  with mlv co 
llc  or mlv  pursuant to which we may issue and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through mlv who will act as our sales agent and underwriter 
sales of our common stock through mlv are made on the principal trading market of our common stock by means of ordinary brokers transactions at market prices  in block transactions or as otherwise agreed by mlv and us 
mlv uses its commercially reasonable efforts to sell our common stock from time to time  based upon our instructions including any price  time or size limits we may impose 
we pay mlv a commission rate of up to of the gross sales price per share of any common stock sold through mlv as agent under the atm agreement 
the company is limited as to how many shares it can sell pursuant to the atm agreement due to sec limitations on the number of shares issuable pursuant to a form s registration statement in a primary offering by smaller reporting companies such as the company 
as of march  the total dollar amount of common stock that the company could sell under the atm agreement during the next twelve months is approximately  under its current registration statement 
the company may be able to sell more shares over the next twelve months under this agreement depending on several factors  including the company s stock price  number of shares outstanding and when the sales take place

the named patient program  to be managed by azanta  provides a regulatory mechanism to allow healthcare professionals in the specified territories to prescribe zybrestat to individual atc patients while it is still in development 
under the terms of the agreement  we will provide zybrestat to azanta 
azanta will serve as exclusive distributor for zybrestat in the specified territories for this purpose and will provide zybrestat to physicians solely to treat atc on a compassionate use basis in the specified territories until such time as zybrestat may obtain marketing approval in that territory 
the specified territories include the european union  including the nordic countries and switzerland  canada  israel and south korea and the agreement may also be expanded to include other countries on a country by country basis 
oxigene and azanta will cooperate on regulatory activities relating to zybrestat for the treatment of atc within the territory 
there will be no transfer of ownership of intellectual property rights for zybrestat to azanta under the terms of the agreement 
we do not expect to receive significant income from azanta under this arrangement 
in the year ended december  we received cash and recognized  of product revenue under this agreement 
no revenue was recognized nor was any cash received under this agreement during 
table of contents based on our limited ongoing programs and operations and the reductions in cash utilization resulting from our september reduction in work force  we expect our existing cash to support our operations through the middle of the fourth quarter of however  this level of cash utilization does not allow for the initiation of any significant projects  including clinical trials  to further the development of our most advanced product candidates  primarily zybrestat 
any significant further development of zybrestat or other capital intensive activities will be contingent upon our ability to raise additional capital in addition to our existing financing arrangements 
we will require significant additional funding to fund operations and to continue the development of our product candidates 
our ongoing capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates under development  including zybrestat and oxi  the costs of complying with fda and other regulatory agency requirements 
for example  it was necessary for us to address findings set forth by the fda in its correspondence to us in of march while we believe we have addressed these findings  we have no assurance that the fda may not require more information or more changes in the future  which may be significant see item a risk factors above regarding regulatory compliance and approvals  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to develop manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending against possible claims of infringement by third party patent or other technology rights  the cost of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand depends in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval  including the range of indications for which any product is granted approval

contractual obligations the following table presents information regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands and thereafter total clinical development and related commitments operating leases total contractual obligations payments under clinical development and related commitments are based on the completion of activities as specified in the contract 
the amounts in the table above assume the successful completion  by the third party contractor  of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we have accounted for certain outstanding warrants issued in connection with our prior equity offerings as liabilities as of december  we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we may from time to time manufacture drugs and conduct trials and studies outside of the united states  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are typically in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
