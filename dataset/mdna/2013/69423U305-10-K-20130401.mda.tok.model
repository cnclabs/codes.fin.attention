item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  reflecting our plans and objectives that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states 
we market all the ethanol produced by the pacific ethanol plants  all the ethanol produced by three other ethanol producers in the western united states and ethanol purchased from other third party suppliers throughout the united states 
we also market ethanol co products for the pacific ethanol plants  including wdg 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states 
our ethanol customers are integrated oil companies and gasoline marketers who blend ethanol into gasoline 
we arrange for transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol purchased by our customers through our agreements with third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  arizona  nevada  utah  oregon  colorado  idaho and washington 
our wdg customers are dairies and feedlots located near the pacific ethanol plants 
we have extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
in some cases  we have marketing agreements with suppliers to market all of the output of their facilities 
we hold an ownership interest in new pe holdco which indirectly owns the pacific ethanol plants through its ownership of the plant owners 
we operate and maintain the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of an asset management agreement with new pe holdco and the plant owners 
we also market ethanol and wdg produced by the pacific ethanol plants under the terms of separate marketing agreements with the plant owners whose facilities are operational 
in addition  we provide operations  maintenance and accounting services for a  gallon per year cellulosic integrated biorefinery owned by zeachem inc in boardman  oregon  which is adjacent to the pacific ethanol columbia plant 
the pacific ethanol plants are comprised of the four facilities described immediately below and have an aggregate annual production capacity of up to million gallons 
three of the facilities are currently operational and one of the facilities is currently idled 
as market conditions change  we may increase  decrease or idle production at one or more operational facilities or resume operations at any idled facility 
facility name facility location estimated annual capacity gallons current operating status magic valley burley  id  operating columbia boardman  or  operating stockton stockton  ca  operating madera madera  ca  idled we earn fees as follows under our asset management and other agreements with new pe holdco and the plant owners ethanol marketing fees of approximately of the net sales price  but not less than per gallon and not more than per gallon  corn procurement and handling fees of per bushel  wdg fees of of the third party purchase price  but not less than per ton and not more than per ton  and asset management fees of  per month for each operating facility and  per month for each idled facility 
we intend to advance our position as the leading marketer and producer of low carbon renewable fuels in the western united states  in part by expanding our relationships with customers and third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol and by expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and transportation fuel 
further  we may seek to provide management services for other third party ethanol production facilities in the western united states 
financial performance summary consolidation we consolidate new pe holdco s financial results due to the nature of our ownership in and control over new pe holdco 
however  since we do not wholly own new pe holdco  we must adjust our consolidated net income loss for the income loss attributed to new pe holdco s other owners 
this adjustment results in net income loss attributed to pacific ethanol  inc see results of operations accounting for the results of new pe holdco below 
summary our consolidated net sales decreased by  or million  to million for from million for our net income loss attributed to pacific ethanol  inc decreased by million to a net loss of million for from net income of million for factors that contributed to our results of operations for include net sales 
the decrease in our net sales for as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o lower production sales volumes 
although our total volume of ethanol sold increased by to million gallons for from million gallons for  our total production sales volume decreased by to million gallons for from million for our net sales for the period decreased because the decline in production gallons sold  which are recorded at gross sales prices  was greater than the increase in third party gallons sold  which are predominantly recorded at net sales prices 
we reduced production sales volume due to lower industry wide corn crush margins resulting from an oversupply of ethanol in relation to demand 
corn crush margins are determined based on the difference between ethanol and corn prices 
o lower ethanol sales prices 
our average ethanol sales price decreased to per gallon for as compared to per gallon for gross margin 
our gross margin declined significantly to negative for from positive for the decline in our gross margin was primarily the result of negative corn crush margins at the pacific ethanol plants for most of the year due to reduced ethanol demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  or sg a  decreased by million to million for  as compared to million for  primarily as a result of lower professional expenses and noncash compensation expenses 
fair value adjustments 
we issued warrants and senior convertible notes that were recorded at fair value  with quarterly adjustments for changes in their fair value  resulting in income of million for as compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the retirement of the senior convertible notes in upon their conversion 
interest expense 
our interest expense decreased by million to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to decreased average debt balances under our convertible notes and credit facilities 
other expense 
our other expense decreased by million to million for from million for this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in bank fees 
sales and margins we generate sales by marketing all the ethanol produced by the pacific ethanol plants  all the ethanol produced by three other ethanol producers in the western united states and ethanol purchased from other third party suppliers throughout the united states 
we also market ethanol co products  including wdg  for the pacific ethanol plants 
our profitability is highly dependent on various commodity prices  including the market prices of ethanol  corn and natural gas 
average ethanol sales prices decreased in as compared to the average price of ethanol  as reported by the chicago board of trade  or cbot  decreased by to for from for the drop in the price of ethanol was due to a drop in demand for gasoline  of which ethanol is a primary blend stock component 
average corn prices  on the other hand  increased in as compared to  further negatively impacting corn crush margins 
specifically  the average price of corn  as reported by the cbot  increased by to for from for we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to significant price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and corn 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales and purchase commitments compared to the magnitude of our existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting in this capacity  we receive a predetermined service fee and have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
for these sales  we record the marketing fee as net sales 
we believe that our gross profit margins depend primarily on five key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe is impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including government mandates  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  the market price of wdg  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at the pacific ethanol plants to our sales of ethanol produced by unrelated third parties 
we seek to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and  when resources are available  implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address these factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of rising ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our limited resources to act upon the anticipated factors described above and or our inability to anticipate these factors or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate these factors or favorable movements in these factors may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
results of operations accounting for the results of new pe holdco since october   our consolidated financial statements have included the financial statements of new pe holdco  which in turn include the financial statements of the plant owners 
on october   we purchased a ownership interest in new pe holdco  which gave us the single largest equity position in new pe holdco 
based on our ownership interest as well as our asset management and marketing agreements with new pe holdco  we determined that  beginning on october   we were the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco  and as such  we consolidated new pe holdco s financial results with our financial results 
as of december   we held a ownership interest in new pe holdco 
we increased our ownership interest in new pe holdco to in the first quarter of selected financial information the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report 
certain performance metrics that we believe are important indicators of our results of operations include years ended december  percentage variance production gallons sold in millions third party gallons sold in millions total gallons sold in millions average sales price per gallon corn cost per bushel cbot equivalent co product revenues as of delivered cost of corn average cbot ethanol price per gallon average cbot corn price per bushel we exclude transportation or basis costs in our corn costs to calculate a cbot equivalent in order to more appropriately compare our corn costs to average cbot corn prices 
co product revenues as percentage of delivered cost of corn shows our yield based on sales of wdg generated from ethanol we produced 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  years ended dollar variance percentage variance results as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december  favorable favorable december  unfavorable unfavorable dollars in thousands net sales    cost of goods sold    gross profit loss    nm selling  general and administrative expenses   income loss from operations    nm fair value adjustments    interest expense  net    other expense  net loss before provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity    provision for income taxes consolidated net loss    net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity    net income loss attributed to pacific ethanol  inc  nm preferred stock dividends   income loss available to common stockholders   nm net sales the decrease in our net sales for as compared to was primarily due to a decrease in total production gallons sold and a decrease in our average sales price per gallon 
total volume of production gallons sold decreased  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the decrease in production gallons sold is primarily due to reduced production rates 
we reduced production rates due to industry wide lower corn crush margins resulting from reduced ethanol demand 
third party gallons sold  however  increased by  or million gallons  to million gallons for as compared to million gallons for the increase in third party gallons sold is primarily due to increased sales under our third party ethanol marketing arrangements 
our net sales for the period decreased because the decline in production gallons sold  which are recorded at gross sales prices  was greater than the increase in third party gallons sold  which are predominantly recorded at net sales prices 
our average sales price per gallon decreased to for from for this decrease in average sales price per gallon is consistent with the average cbot price per gallon  which decreased to for from for cost of goods sold and gross profit loss our gross profit loss declined to a gross loss of million for from a gross profit of million for primarily due to poor commodity margins predominately related to the spread between ethanol prices and corn and energy costs 
our gross margin declined to negative for as compared to positive for selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a decreased by million to million for as compared to million for the decrease in sg a is primarily due to the following factors professional expenses declined by million  and noncash compensation expense declined by million due to the decreased value of restricted stock awards to our employees and members of our board 
fair value adjustments we issued senior convertible notes and warrants in the fourth quarter of for million in cash 
the senior convertible notes and warrants were recorded at fair value and adjusted quarterly 
as a result of quarterly adjustments to their fair values  we recorded income of million for as compared to million for this decrease is primarily due to the retirement of the senior convertible notes in upon their conversion 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million to million for from million for the decrease is primarily due to decreased average debt balances  which included our senior convertible notes and the term loans and credit facilities for new pe holdco and kinergy 
other expense  net other expense decreased by million to million for from million for the decrease in other expense is primarily due to a reduction in bank fees 
net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity net loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in variable interest entity relates to the consolidated treatment of new pe holdco  and represents the noncontrolling interest of other owners in new pe holdco s earnings 
we consolidated new pe holdco s financial results for the periods presented  however  we owned less than of new pe holdco  and accordingly reduced our net loss for the noncontrolling interest  which represents the remaining ownership interest that we do not own 
preferred stock dividends shares of our series b preferred stock are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series b preferred stock 
we accrued dividends of million for each of and liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily from cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and various capital raising transactions in which we raised aggregate net proceeds of million through the issuance of an aggregate of million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of up to million shares of our common stock 
as of march   the plant owners had up to million in combined term and revolving debt  of which million is due on june   up to million in revolving debt is due on june  and million in combined term and revolving debt is due on june    of which pacific ethanol owns million 
see plant owners term debt and operating lines of credit below 
the plant owners do not and may not have sufficient funds to repay the up to million in debt on or prior to its maturity on june  we have entered into agreements to raise capital to repay the debt  but the closing under the agreements requires stockholder approval 
if we are unable to timely restructure the debt or raise sufficient capital to repay the debt  the plant owners will be in default on that debt and in cross default on the million in revolving and term debt due on june  plus up to an additional million in revolving debt due june   all of which may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable on june  the plants owners inability to restructure or repay the million of debt due on june  prior to its maturity will likely have a material adverse effect on us and our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including kinergy and the plant owners 
our current available capital resources consist of cash on hand and amounts available for borrowing under kinergy s credit facility 
in addition  the plant owners have credit facilities for use in the operations of the pacific ethanol plants 
we expect that our future available capital resources will consist primarily of our remaining cash balances  amounts available for borrowing  if any  under kinergy s credit facility  cash generated from kinergy s ethanol marketing business  fees paid under our asset management agreement relating to our operation of the pacific ethanol plants  distributions  if any  in respect of our ownership interest in new pe holdco  and the remaining proceeds of any future debt and or equity financings 
subject to closing under our existing agreements to raise capital to repay the debt due june   which requires stockholder approval of the transaction  we believe that current and future available capital resources  revenues generated from operations  and other existing sources of liquidity  including our credit facilities  will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections  if unforeseen circumstances occur  or if we require a significant amount of cash to fund future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  could restrict its growth  or hinder our ability to compete 
quantitative year end liquidity status we believe that the following amounts provide insight into our liquidity and capital resources 
the following selected financial information should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report dollars in thousands as of and for the year ended december  variance cash and cash equivalents   current assets   total assets of variable interest entity   current liabilities   property and equipment  net   notes payable  current portion  nm notes payable  noncurrent portion   total liabilities of variable interest entity   working capital   working capital ratio change in working capital and cash flows working capital decreased from million at december  to million at december  as a result of a decrease in current assets of million  partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities of million 
current assets decreased primarily due to a decrease in inventories  due to the timing of sales at the end of as compared to current liabilities decreased primarily due to the reclassification of accrued and unpaid dividends in respect of our series b preferred stock to noncurrent liabilities 
cash used in our operating activities of million resulted primarily from our consolidated net loss of million and million in income from fair value adjustments  partially offset by million in depreciation and amortization of intangibles  interest expense added to the plant owners debt  a million decrease in prepaid inventory  a million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
cash used in our investing activities of million resulted primarily from our part purchase of additional ownership interests in new pe holdco for million in cash and additions to property and equipment of million 
cash provided by our financing activities of million resulted primarily from million in proceeds from the plant owners borrowings  million in net proceeds from the issuance and sale of our common stock and warrants  partially offset by million in principal payments on our senior notes  million in cash dividend payments in respect of our series b preferred stock and million in debt issuance costs 
kinergy operating line of credit kinergy maintains an operating line of credit for an aggregate amount of up to million  with an optional accordion feature for up to an additional million 
the credit facility expires on december  interest accrues under the credit facility at a rate equal to i the three month london interbank offered rate libor  plus ii a specified applicable margin ranging between and 
the credit facility s monthly unused line fee is of the amount by which the maximum credit under the facility exceeds the average daily principal balance 
payments that may be made by kinergy to pacific ethanol as reimbursement for management and other services provided by pacific ethanol to kinergy are limited under the terms of the credit facility to million per fiscal quarter in  million per fiscal quarter in  million per fiscal quarter in and million per fiscal quarter in the credit facility also includes the accounts receivable of pap as additional collateral 
payments that may be made by pap to pacific ethanol as reimbursement for management and other services provided by pacific ethanol to pap are limited under the terms of the credit facility to the extent that quarterly payments would result in pap recording less than million of net income in the quarter 
for the fiscal quarter ending june  and each fiscal quarter thereafter  kinergy and pap are collectively required to generate aggregate earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  of  for the quarter and aggregate ebitda of million for each two consecutive quarters 
these amounts are required through december  in  the required ebitda amounts increase to million per quarter and million for each two consecutive quarters 
further  for all monthly periods  kinergy and pap must collectively maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio calculated as a twelve month rolling ebitda divided by the sum of interest expense  capital expenditures  principal payments of indebtedness  indebtedness from capital leases and taxes paid during such twelve month rolling period of at least and are prohibited from incurring any additional indebtedness other than specific intercompany indebtedness or making any capital expenditures in excess of million absent the lender s prior consent 
kinergy and pap s obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority security interest in all of their assets in favor of the lender

as of december   kinergy had an available borrowing base under the credit facility of million and an outstanding balance of million 
plant owners term debt and operating lines of credit the plant owners debt  prior to any of the amendments discussed below  consisted of a million tranche a term loan  a million tranche a term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
except as noted below  the term and revolving debt require monthly interest payments at a floating rate equal to the three month libor or the prime rate of interest  at the plant owners election  plus 
at december   the interest rate was approximately 
repayments of principal are based on available free cash flow of the borrower  until maturity  when all principal amounts are due 
from july  through march   the plant owners entered into transactions which amended the term and revolving debt and extended the maturity dates in respect of million of the combined term loans and million of the original million in revolving debt from june  to june  in addition  the aggregate commitment amount under the revolving credit facility was increased by million to million  with a maturity date of june  further  monthly interest payments due to certain lenders on both the amended term and revolving debt  at the option of the plant owners  may  through june   be deferred and added to the principal amount of the loans maturing on the extended maturity date of june  the amendments also provide the plant owners with the ability to repay amounts owed to the lenders who have not extended their loans without penalty while keeping the extended loans in place 
new operating line of credit on october   the plant owners entered into a new revolving credit facility that initially provided up to an additional million 
the plant owners were able to request increases in the amount of the facility in increments of not less than million  up to a maximum additional credit limit of million 
on march   the lenders approved million in additional availability for a maximum total credit limit of million under the facility 
loans made under the credit facility originally matured on june  or such later date on or prior to june   as may be agreed to by certain of the lenders 
the plant owners have the right at any time  and from time to time  but subject to limitations imposed by an intercreditor agreement  to prepay in whole or in part the revolving loans and tranche a loans and the tranche a loans following the payment in full of the revolving loans and tranche a loans 
however  in the event of any prepayment of the tranche a loans that have a maturity date of june   the plant owners must pay a premium equal to the present value of all interest payments that would have accrued from the date of such payment through june   calculated using a discount rate  applied quarterly  equal to the treasury rate as of such prepayment date plus basis points 
the credit agreement also provides for mandatory prepayments in connection with certain customary events  including any sale of material assets  however  certain mandatory prepayments are not subject to the prepayment premium 
on january   the plant owners entered into an amendment to the new revolving credit facility and extended the maturity date of the facility from june  to june  as of december   the plant owners had unused availability under the new revolving credit facility of million 
all of the term loans and revolving credit facilities represent permanent financing and are secured by a perfected  first priority security interest in all of the assets  including inventories and all rights  title and interest in all tangible and intangible assets  of the plant owners 
the plant owners creditors do not have recourse to pacific ethanol  inc pacific ethanol debt january notes on january  we issued and sold million in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes and warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in january the notes mature on march  and bear interest at the rate of per annum  subject to adjustment 
if the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the january notes is not less than million by january   the interest rate will increase commencing on january  by per annum on each of january  april  july and october until the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the january notes is less than million 
if we issue equity or equity linked securities  conduct certain sales of assets or incur certain indebtedness  then we will be obligated to prepay the january notes using all net cash proceeds from the transaction  provided that any proceeds received in connection with an equity linked issuance must be used to either prepay the notes or purchase certain outstanding debt issued by the plant owners 
interest on the notes is payable in cash in arrears on the fifteenth day of each month beginning on march  subject to the satisfaction of certain equity conditions  at our option  we may elect to pay interest due and payable in shares of our common stock  provided that the interest rate applicable to any outstanding amounts we pay in shares of common stock will increase by per annum from the then applicable interest rate for the period for which such interest is paid 
the number of shares to be issued for any particular interest payment equals the quotient of x the amount of interest payable assuming payment in shares  divided by y the product of i the weighted average price of our common stock for the thirty trading days immediately preceding but excluding the payment due date  and ii 
march notes on march   we issued million in series a subordinated convertible notes  or series a notes  and warrants to purchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share 
of the warrants issued in the transaction  warrants to purchase million shares of common stock expire in march and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock expire two years after the closing of the issuance of an million tranche of series b subordinated convertible notes  which is anticipated to close  subject to stockholder approval  in june unless converted or redeemed earlier  the series a notes will mature on march  the series a notes bear interest at per annum  compounded monthly 
all amounts due under the series a notes are convertible at any time  in whole or in part  at the option of the holders into shares of our common stock at a conversion price  or fixed conversion price  which is subject to adjustment as described below 
the series a notes are initially convertible into shares of our common stock at the initial fixed conversion price of per share 
if we sell or issue any securities with floating conversion prices based on the market price of our common stock  the holder of a series a note will have the right thereafter to substitute the floating conversion price for the fixed conversion price upon conversion of all or part of the series a note 
amortization payments  together with accrued and unpaid interest on the series a notes  will be payable on monthly installment dates 
on or prior to the tenth calendar day before each installment date  we are required to deliver a notice electing to effect a redemption in cash or a conversion of the installment amount due on the installment date into shares of our common stock 
our ability to pay an installment amount in shares of our common stock is subject to numerous equity conditions  the failure of any of which  unless waived  will require that we pay an installment amount solely in cash 
on the applicable installment date  we are required to deliver to the holders of series a notes an amount of shares of common stock equal to that portion of the installment amount being converted divided by the lesser of the then existing fixed conversion price and of the market price on the installment date  or the company conversion price 
the market price on any given date is equal to the lesser of i the volume weighted average price on the trading day immediately preceding the date of determination  and ii the average of the three lowest volume weighted average prices during the ten trading day period ending on the trading day immediately prior to the date of determination 
the holder of a series a note may  at the holder s election by giving notice to us  defer the payment of the installment amount due on any installment date to another installment date  in which case the amount deferred will become part of the subsequent installment date and will continue to accrue interest 
on any day during the period commencing on an installment date and ending on the trading day prior to the next installment date  the holder of a series a note may  at its election  convert the installment amounts due on up to four future installment dates at the company conversion price in effect on the current installment date  provided that if we had elected to convert the installment amount due on the current installment date  the holder may only convert up to three future installment amounts 
upon the occurrence of certain events of default  there will be no limitation on the number of installment amounts that the holder may accelerate and the company conversion price applicable to conversions made pursuant to this acceleration feature will equal the lesser of i the company conversion price on the current installment date  ii of the market price as defined below  and iii the fixed conversion price then in effect 
note payable to related party on march   our chief executive officer provided funds in an aggregate amount of million for general working capital purposes  in exchange for an unsecured promissory note issued by us 
interest on the unpaid principal amount accrues at a rate of per annum 
as of december   the remaining amount of million was due and payable on the extended maturity date of march  on february   the maturity date was further extended to march  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at the pacific ethanol plants 
as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which the risks and rewards of inventory ownership remain with third party suppliers and we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are acting as an agent between a customer and a supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the supplier s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
when we act as an agent  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined fees and any associated freight  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
consolidation of variable interest entity we analyze whether any of our variable interests constitute controlling financial interests in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
we perform ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity at the end of each reporting period 
on october   upon our initial purchase of a interest in new pe holdco  we determined that we were new pe holdco s primary beneficiary and began consolidating the results of new pe holdco 
as of december   we held a ownership interest in new pe holdco 
we increased our ownership interest in new pe holdco to in the first quarter of as long as we believe we are deemed the primary beneficiary of new pe holdco  we will treat new pe holdco as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
these determinations will be reassessed for appropriateness at each future reporting period 
warrants and convertible notes carried at fair value we have recorded our warrants issued since and our senior convertible notes issued in at fair value 
we believe the valuation of these warrants and convertible notes is a critical accounting estimate because valuation estimates obtained from third parties involve inputs other than quoted prices to value the exercise and conversion features 
changes in these estimates  and in particular  certain of the inputs to the valuation estimates  can be volatile from period to period and may markedly impact the total mark to market valuation of the warrants and convertible notes recorded as fair value adjustments in our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded fair value adjustments on warrants and convertible notes as income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our senior convertible notes issued in were retired in impairment of long lived and intangible assets our long lived assets have been primarily associated with the pacific ethanol plants  reflecting their original book value  adjusted for any subsequent impairment 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of an asset could be less than the net book value of the asset 
we assess long lived assets for impairment by first determining the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows each asset is expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset 
if the amount of proceeds is less than the carrying value of the asset  we then determine the fair value of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industry in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  including inflation  and the purchasing decisions of our customers 
we review our intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these assets using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
we did not recognize any asset impairment charges associated with the pacific ethanol plants in or allowance for doubtful accounts we sell ethanol primarily to gasoline refining and distribution companies and sell wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk from sales of our ethanol as of december  and  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
however  historically  those ethanol customers have had good credit ratings and we have collected the amounts billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance in question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
we recognized a recovery of bad debt expense of less than million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively
