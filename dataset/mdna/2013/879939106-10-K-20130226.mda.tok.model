iii part i item business our business teletech is one of the largest and most geographically diverse global providers of technology enabled  fully integrated customer experience management solutions 
we have a year history of helping our clients maximize the value of their brand through the design and delivery of exceptional customer experiences 
our end to end offering originates with the design of data rich customer centric strategies 
these customer centric strategies are then enabled by a suite of technologies and world class operations that allow us to more effectively manage and grow the economic value of our client s customer relationships 
we have developed deep vertical industry expertise and serve approximately global clients in the automotive  broadband  communications  financial services  government  healthcare  logistics  media and entertainment  retail  technology and travel industries 
we target customer focused industry leaders in the global  which are the world s largest companies based on market capitalization  due to their size  global reach and desire for a partner who can quickly and globally scale a suite of fully integrated services 
we typically enter into long term relationships which provide us with a more predictable revenue stream 
our relationships with our top five clients have ranged from six to years with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us 
we were founded in and reorganized as a delaware corporation in we completed an initial public offering of our common stock in and since then have grown our annual revenue from million to  million  representing a compounded annual growth rate cagr of 
to further improve our competitive position and stay ahead of a rapidly changing market for our services  we continue to invest in new growth areas 
we believe our commitment to innovation will enable us to remain strategically relevant to our clients and to grow and diversify our revenue into higher margin  more technology enabled services 
of the  million in revenue we reported in  approximately or million came from customer centric strategy  growth or technology based services with the remainder coming from our traditional customer management services 
we believe our track record of innovation  operational excellence  financial strength and ability to deliver on the business goals of our clients represent our strongest competitive advantages and have been significant contributors to our client retention rate of in our solid balance sheet  cash flows from operations and access to capital markets have provided us the financial flexibility to fund our organic growth  strategic acquisitions and our ongoing stock repurchase program 
as a means of executing our strategy to expand our operating segments  we have in the past and may in the future acquire additional companies  products or technologies 
during  we made four acquisitions including onstate communications corporation onstate in january  iknowtion llc iknowtion in february  guidon performance solutions guidon in october and technology solutions group  inc tsg in december 
we have included the financial results of the business combinations in our consolidated results of operations beginning on the respective acquisition dates  however  the impact of these acquisitions was not material to our consolidated balance sheets and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding our acquisitions 
as part of our previously announced decision to exit certain underperforming markets and programs  we ceased operations in spain as of july  the termination of these operations resulted in total pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of million during as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
during  we generated million in free cash flow and our cash flow from operations in combination with borrowings under our revolving credit facility enabled us to fund million in capital expenditures along with million in stock repurchases 
approximately of our capital expenditures were related to the growth of our business with the remaining used for maintenance of our embedded infrastructure and internal technology systems 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion of free cash flow 
we continue to return capital to our shareholders via an ongoing stock repurchase program which was initially authorized by our board of directors in november the board periodically authorizes additional increases to the program 
as of december   the cumulative authorized repurchase allowance was million  of which we repurchased million shares for million 
as of december   the remaining allowance under the program was approximately million 
for the period from january  through february   we have not purchased any additional shares 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
our market opportunity we believe that our revenue will grow over the long term as global demand for our services is fueled by the following trends increasing focus on the customer experience to sustain competitive advantage 
the ability to sustain a competitive advantage based on price or product differentiation has significantly narrowed given the speed of technological innovation 
as customers become more connected and widely broadcast their experiences across a variety of social networking channels  the quality of the experience is having a profound impact on brand loyalty and business performance 
we believe customers are increasingly shaping their attitudes  behaviors and willingness to recommend or stay with a brand on the totality of their experience  including not only the superiority of the product or service but more importantly on the quality of their ongoing service interactions 
given the strong correlation between high customer satisfaction and improved profitability  we believe more companies are increasingly focused on selecting third party partners  such as teletech  who can deliver a data driven  fully integrated solution that increases the lifetime value of each customer relationship versus merely reducing costs 
increasing percentage of companies consolidating their customer experience requirements with the most capable partners who can deliver measurable business outcomes by offering a fully integrated  technology rich solution 
the proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices along with customers increased access to information and heightened expectations are driving the need for companies to implement enabling technologies that ensure customers have the best experience regardless of the device  location or media they chose 
these two way interactions need to be received or delivered seamlessly via the customer channel of choice and include voice  email  chat  sms text  intelligent self serve  virtual agents and the social web 
we believe companies will continue to consolidate to third party partners  such as teletech  who have demonstrated expertise in increasing brand value by delivering a holistic  fully integrated customer centric solution that spans strategy to execution versus the time  expense and often failed returns resulting from linking together a series of point solutions from different providers 
focus on speed to market by companies launching new products or entering new geographic locations 
as companies broaden their product offerings and seek to enter new emerging markets  they are looking for partners that can provide speed to market while reducing their capital and operating risk 
to achieve these benefits  companies select us because of our extensive operating history  established global footprint  financial strength to invest in ongoing technological innovation and the ability to quickly scale infrastructure and large  complex business processes around the globe in a short period of time while assuring a high quality experience for their customers 
our future growth strategy we aim to grow our revenue and profitability by focusing on higher margin  technology enabled services that drive a superior customer experience 
to that end we plan to accelerate investment in both vertical sales leadership and our technology enabled services and platforms  build deeper  more strategic relationships with existing global clients to drive enduring  transformational change within their organizations  pursue new clients who lead their respective industries and who are committed to the customer experience as a differentiator  target additional  accretive acquisitions that further complement and expand our integrated solution  and build on our heritage of technology innovation through the creation of proprietary new intellectual property and bring new capabilities to the market that previously did not exist 
as we further develop and scale our strategic business segments  we are continually evaluating ways to maximize stockholder value  which could include  among other things  the sale  merger or spin off of equity interests in our subsidiaries or the disposition of business units  in whole or in part 
our business segments beginning in the first quarter of we aligned our operations around the following four business segments to more closely reflect our organizational structure as well as our expanding suite of customer experience management solutions 
based on the requirements of our clients  we provide our services both on a fully integrated and discrete basis 
design customer strategy services we typically begin by engaging our clients at a strategic level 
through our data driven management consulting expertise we help our clients design and build their customer experience strategies 
we improve our clients ability to better understand and predict their customers behaviors and preferences along with their current and future economic value so that they can deploy resources to achieve the greatest return 
using proprietary analytic models  we provide the insight clients need to build the business case for customer centricity  to better optimize their marketing spend and then work alongside them to help implement our recommendations 
a key component of this practice involves instilling a high performance culture through a lean management framework 
this process optimization capability enables the client to align and cascade the recommended initiatives to ensure accountability and transparency for the ultimate achievement and sustainability of future results 
enable customer technology services once the design of the customer experience is completed  our ability to architect  deploy and host or manage the client s customer management environments becomes a key enabler to achieving and sustaining the client s customer experience vision 
given the proliferation of mobile communication technologies and devices  we enable our clients operations to interact with their customers across the growing array of channels including email  social networks  mobile  web  sms text  voice and chat 
we design  implement and manage cloud  on premise or hybrid customer management environments to deliver a consistent and superior experience across all touch points on a global scale that we believe result in higher quality  lower costs and reduced risk for our clients 
manage customer management services we redesign and manage clients front to back office processes to deliver just in time  personalized  multi channel interactions 
our front office solutions seamlessly integrate voice  chat  e mail  ecommerce and social media to optimize the customer experience for our clients 
in addition  we manage certain back office processes for our clients to enhance their ability to obtain a customer centric view of their relationships and maximize operating efficiencies 
our delivery of integrated business processes via our onshore  offshore or work from home associates reduces operating costs and allows customer needs to be met more quickly and efficiently  resulting in higher satisfaction  brand loyalty and a stronger competitive position for our clients 
grow customer growth services we offer fully integrated sales and marketing solutions to help our clients boost revenue in new  fragmented or underpenetrated business to consumer or business to business markets 
we deliver approximately billion in client revenue annually via the acquisition  growth and retention of customers through a combination of our highly trained  client dedicated sales professionals and our proprietary revana analytic multichannel platformtm 
this platform continuously aggregates individual customer information across all channels into one holistic view so as to ensure more relevant and personalized communications 
these communications are dynamically triggered to send the right message to the right customer at the right time via their preferred communication channel 
the ability of our sales associates to be backed by a highly scalable  technology enabled platform that delivers smarter  more targeted digital marketing messages over email  social networks  mobile  web  sms text  voice and chat results in higher conversion rates at a lower overall cost for our clients 
additional information with respect to our segments and geographic footprint is contained in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
our competitive strengths as the complexity and pace of technological change required to deliver an exceptional multi channel customer experience increases  we believe our clients select us for a number of reasons including our industry reputation and our position as one of the largest and most financially sound industry partners with years of expertise in delivering fully integrated customer experience solutions designed to enable  manage and grow the value of every customer relationship  ability to deliver multi channel  multi modal solutions that meet the rapidly changing profile of the customer and their heightened expectations  ability to scale infrastructure and employees worldwide using globally deployed best practices to ensure a consistent  high quality service  ability to optimize the performance of our workforce through proprietary hiring  training and performance optimization tools  and commitment to continued product and services innovation to further diversify our revenue and enhance the strategic capabilities of our clients 
we believe that our technological excellence  innovative human capital strategies and globally scaled and deployed best practices are key elements to our continued industry leadership 
technological excellence we believe we were one of the first companies in our industry to migrate our technology platform to a secure  private  internet protocol ip based infrastructure 
this architecture has enabled us to centralize and standardize our worldwide delivery capabilities resulting in improved scalability and quality of delivery for our clients while lowering our capital and information technology it operating costs 
the foundation of this platform is our four ip hosting centers known as teletech gigapops  which are located on three continents 
these centers provide a fully integrated suite of voice and data routing  workforce management  quality monitoring  business analytic and storage capabilities 
this enables anywhere to anywhere  real time processing of our clients business needs from any location around the globe 
this hub and spoke model enables us to provide our services at the lowest cost while increasing scalability  reliability  redundancy  asset utilization and the diversity of our service offerings 
to ensure high end to end security and reliability of this critical infrastructure  we monitor and manage the teletech gigapops x  days per year from several strategically located state of the art global command centers as well as providing redundant  fail over capabilities for each gigapop 
importantly  this platform has become the foundation for new  innovative offerings including teletech s cloud based offerings  teletech home and our suite of human capital solutions 
our technology innovations have resulted in issued intellectual property patents as well as filed patent applications 
innovative human capital strategies our global employees are a crucial component to the success of our business 
we have made significant investments in a proprietary suite of technologies  management methodologies and training processes in the areas of talent acquisition  learning services  knowledge management  workforce collaboration and performance optimization 
these capabilities are the culmination of years experience in managing large  global workforces combined with the latest technology  innovation and strategy in the field of human capital management 
this capability has enabled us to deliver a consistent  scalable and flexible workforce that is highly engaged in achieving or exceeding our client s business objectives 
globally deployed best operating practices globally deployed best operating practices assure that we deliver a consistent  scalable  high quality experience to our clients customers from any of our delivery centers or work from home associates around the world 
standardized processes include our approach to attracting  screening  hiring  training  scheduling  evaluating  coaching and maximizing associate performance to meet our clients needs 
we provide real time reporting on performance across the globe to ensure consistency of delivery 
in addition  this information provides valuable insight into what is driving customer inquiries  enabling us to proactively recommend process changes to our clients to optimize their customers experience 
with delivery centers in countries  we believe this makes us one of the largest and most geographically diverse providers of customer experience solutions 
we plan to selectively expand into other attractive delivery markets over time 
of the countries from which we provide customer experience solutions  provide services for onshore clients including the us  australia  brazil  china  england  germany  ghana  new zealand  northern ireland  scotland and south africa 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or of our total delivery capacity 
the other five countries provide services  partially or entirely  for offshore clients including argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico and the philippines 
the total number of workstations in these countries is  or of our total delivery capacity 
see item a 
risk factors for a description of the risks associated with our foreign operations 
clients in  one of our clients represented of our total annual revenue 
our top five and ten clients represented and of total revenue in  respectively 
we have experienced long term relationships with our top five clients  ranging from six to years  with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with us 
certain of our communications clients also provide us with telecommunication services through transactions that are negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
these clients currently represent approximately of our total annual revenue 
we believe each of these supplier contracts is negotiated on an arm s length basis and that the terms are substantially the same as those that have been negotiated with unrelated vendors 
expenditures under these supplier contracts represent less than one percent of our total operating costs 
competition we compete primarily with the in house customer experience management operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide business process outsourcing bpo services including accenture ltd  convergys corporation  genpact limited  sykes enterprises incorporated  ibm and teleperformance  among others 
we compete primarily on the basis of our years of experience  our global locations  our quality and scope of services  our speed and flexibility of implementation  our technological expertise  and our total value delivered and contractual terms 
a number of competitors may have different capabilities and resources than ours 
additionally  niche providers or new entrants could capture a segment of the market by developing new systems or services that could impact our market potential 
seasonality historically  we experience a seasonal increase in revenue in the fourth quarter related to higher volumes from clients primarily in retail and other industries with seasonal businesses 
also  our operating margins in the first quarter are impacted by higher payroll related taxes predominantly in our us workforce 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees in countries 
approximately of these employees held full time positions and were located outside of the us we have approximately  employees outside the us and canada covered by collective bargaining agreements 
in most cases  the collective bargaining agreements are mandated under national labor laws 
these collective bargaining agreements include employees in the following countries in argentina  approximately employees are covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the confederation of commerce employees that is scheduled to be renegotiated in april  in brazil  approximately  employees are covered by industry wide collective bargaining agreements with sintratel and sintelmark that expire in december  in mexico  we have approximately  employees covered by an industry wide collective bargaining agreement with the federacion obrero sindicalista that expired in january and is currently being re negotiated  in australia  approximately employees are covered by a collective agreement adopted by teletech international  pty 
ltd 
under the provisions of the contract call centres award which had a nominal expiry in august  but which will continue in force until terminated in accordance with the provisions of the fair work act  and in ghana  approximately employees are covered by a collective agreement adopted by teletech customer care management ghana limited under the provisions of the collective agreement between teletech customer care management ghana ltd 
and communication workers union of ghana trades union congress that expires in march we anticipate that these agreements will be renewed and that any renewals will not impact us in a manner materially different from all other companies covered by such industry wide agreements 
we believe that our relations with our employees and unions are satisfactory 
we have not experienced any material work stoppages in our ongoing business 
intellectual property and proprietary technology our success is partially dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property 
we have a number of pending patent applications in the us and foreign countries 
our technology is also protected under copyright laws 
additionally  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we and our subsidiaries have trademarks or registered trademarks in the us and other countries  including teletech  the teletech globe design  teletech gigapop  teletech global ventures  hirepoint  identify  identify plus  workbooth  total delivered value  your customer management partner  revanatm  to  peppers and rogers group  eloyalty and the eloyalty design 
we believe that several of our trademarks are of material importance 
some of our proprietary technology is licensed to others under corresponding license agreements 
some of our technology is licensed from others 
while our competitive position could be affected by our ability to protect our intellectual property  we believe that we have generally taken commercially reasonable steps to protect our intellectual property

item a 
risk factors in evaluating our business  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties discussed in this section  in addition to the other information presented in this annual report on form k 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only risks that we face 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operation could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common stock may decline 
changes in us and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our business our business is directly affected by the performance of our clients and general economic conditions 
turmoil in the financial markets has adversely affected economic activity in the us and other regions of the world in which we do business 
there is evidence that this is affecting demand for some of our services 
in substantially all of our client programs  we generate revenue based  in large part  on the amount of time our employees devote to our clients customers 
consequently  the amount of revenue generated from any particular client program is dependent upon consumers interest in and use of our client s products and or services  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
our clients may not be able to market or develop products and services that require their customers to use our services  especially as a result of the downturn in the us and worldwide economy 
furthermore  a decline in our clients business or performance  including possible client bankruptcies  could impair their ability to pay for our services 
our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected if any of our major clients were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay for our services 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenue and operating results we rely on strategic  long term relationships with large  global companies in targeted industries 
as a result  we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from relatively few clients 
our five largest clients collectively represented of revenue in and of revenue in our ten largest clients represented of revenue in and of revenue in we had one client that represented of our revenue in we believe that a substantial portion of our total revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of our clients in the future 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and we cannot provide any assurance that we will continue to renew any of these contracts or  if renewed  that new contracts will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
the volumes and profit margins of our most significant programs may decline and we may not be able to replace such clients or programs with clients or programs that generate comparable revenue and profits 
the loss of all or part of a major client s business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
client consolidations could result in a loss of clients or contract concessions that would adversely affect our operating results we serve clients in targeted industries that have historically experienced a significant level of consolidation 
if one of our clients is acquired by another company including another one of our clients  provisions in certain of our contracts allow these clients to cancel or renegotiate their contracts  or to seek contract concessions 
such consolidations may result in the termination or phasing out of an existing client contract  volume discounts and other contract concessions that could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our concentration of business activities in certain geographic areas subjects us to risks that may harm our results of operations and financial condition we have delivery centers in many countries  and some business activities may be concentrated in certain geographic areas  including the philippines and latin america 
as a result  we are subject to risks that may interrupt or limit our ability to operate our delivery centers or increase the cost of operating in these geographic areas  which could harm our results of operations and financial condition  including security concerns  such as armed conflict and civil or military unrest  crime  political instability or terrorist activity  health concerns  natural disasters  inefficient and limited infrastructure and disruptions  such as large scale outages or interruptions of service from utilities  transportation  or telecommunications providers  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations  and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  differing employment practices  prevailing wage rates and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti corruption laws and regulations  and regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ among jurisdictions 
we may be disproportionately exposed to interruption of or limitations to the operation of our business or increases in operating costs in these geographic areas due to these or other factors 
as a result  any interruption or limitation of  or increase in costs related to  our operations in these geographic areas could harm our results of operations and financial condition 
unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client and customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation  penalties and cause us to lose clients we are dependent on it networks and systems to process  transmit and store electronic information and to communicate among our locations around the world and with our alliance partners and clients 
security breaches of this infrastructure could lead to shutdowns or disruptions of our systems and potential unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
we are also required at times to manage  utilize and store sensitive or confidential client or customer data 
as a result  we are subject to numerous us and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect this information  such as the european union directive on data protection and various us federal and state laws governing the protection of health or other individually identifiable information 
if any person  including any of our employees  negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution 
unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer data  whether through systems failure  employee negligence  malfeasance  fraud  misappropriation  or other disruptions could damage our reputation and cause us to lose clients 
similarly  unauthorized access to  or destruction of  data through our information systems or those we develop for our clients  whether by our employees or third parties  could result in negative publicity  legal liability and damage to our reputation  business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
compliance with laws  including changes to such laws  could adversely affect our results of operations our businesses are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state  local and foreign authorities  primarily relating to confidential client and customer data and customer communications 
costs of compliance with federal  state  local and foreign existing and future regulations could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
if our businesses fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability  damages and fines 
in the us  some of our services must comply with various federal and state regulations regarding the method of placing outbound telephone calls 
lawsuits or enforcement actions by federal  state  local and or foreign regulatory agencies may materially increase our costs 
in addition  we could incur liability for failure to comply with laws or regulations related to the portions of our clients businesses that are transferred to us 
our failure to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients could cause a reduction in our revenue and operating results our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our facilities  computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  terrorist or cyber attacks  sabotage  telecommunications interruption or failure  labor shortages  weather conditions  natural disasters and other similar events 
additionally  severe weather can cause our employees to miss work and interrupt the delivery of our services  resulting in a loss of revenue 
in the event we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our locations including our corporate headquarters building  our business could be materially adversely affected and we may be required to pay contractual damages or face the suspension or loss of a client s business 
further  the impacts associated with global climate change  such as rising sea levels or increased and intensified storm activity  may cause increased business interruptions or may require the relocation of our facilities located in low lying coastal areas 
the failure to deliver uninterrupted service to our clients could materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our business could be negatively impacted by security threats and other disruptions major equipment failures  natural disasters  including severe weather  terrorist acts  cyber attacks or other breaches of network or information technology security that affect our wireline and gigapop networks  including transport facilities  communications switches  routers  or other equipment or third party owned local and long distance networks on which we rely  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
in addition to disrupting service and operations  these events could require significant resources and result in a loss of clients or impair our ability to attract new clients  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our financial results depend on our capacity utilization  in particular our ability to forecast our clients customer demand and make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and operating expenses our delivery center utilization rates have a substantial and direct effect on our profitability  and we may not achieve desired utilization rates 
our utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including our ability to maintain and increase capacity in each of our delivery centers during peak and non peak hours  our ability to predict our clients customer demand for our services and thereby to make corresponding decisions regarding staffing levels  investments and other operating expenditures in each of our delivery center locations  our ability to hire and assimilate new employees and manage employee turnover  and our need to devote time and resources to training  professional development and other non chargeable activities 
however  because the majority of our business is inbound from our clients customer initiated encounters  we have significantly higher utilization during peak weekday periods than during off peak night and weekend periods 
we have experienced periods of idle capacity  particularly in our multi client delivery centers 
historically  we experience idle peak period capacity upon opening a new delivery center or termination or completion of a large client program 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain desired delivery center capacity utilization 
as a result of the fixed costs associated with each delivery center  quarterly variations in client volumes  many of which are outside our control  can have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates 
if our utilization rates are below expectations in any given period  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows for that period could be adversely affected 
many of our contracts utilize performance pricing that link some of our fees to the attainment of various performance criteria  which could increase the variability of our revenue and operating margin a majority of our contracts include performance clauses that condition some of our fees on the achievement of agreed upon performance criteria 
these performance criteria can be complex and often depend in some measure on actual levels of business activity 
if we fail to satisfy these criteria  it could reduce our revenue under the contracts and operating margin 
our contracts provide for early termination  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows most of our contracts do not ensure that we will generate a minimum level of revenue and the profitability of each client program may fluctuate  sometimes significantly  throughout the various stages of a program 
our contracts generally enable the clients to terminate the contract or reduce customer interaction volumes 
this could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations and cash flows if our larger contracts are terminated prior to the end of those contracts 
we may not be able to offset increased costs with increased service fees under long term contracts some of our larger long term contracts allow us to increase our service fees if and to the extent certain cost or price indices increase 
the majority of our expenses are payroll and payroll related  which includes healthcare costs 
over the past several years  payroll costs  including healthcare costs  have increased at a rate much greater than that of general cost or price indices 
increases in our service fees that are based upon increases in cost or price indices may not fully compensate us for increases in labor and other costs incurred in providing services 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to recover increases in our costs through increased service fees 
our business and operating results may be adversely affected by risks associated with international operations and expansion a component of our growth strategy is continued international expansion 
there are risks inherent with conducting international business  including but not limited to management of personnel overseas  longer payment cycles and or difficulties in accounts receivable collections  foreign currency exchange rates  difficulties in complying with foreign laws  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  political and social instability  as demonstrated by terrorist threats  regime change  increasing tension in the middle east and other regions  and the resulting need for enhanced security measures  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one or more of these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to manage our international operations successfully 
our financial results may be adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange risk we serve an increasing number of our clients from delivery centers in other countries such as argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico  and the philippines 
contracts with these clients are typically priced  invoiced  and paid in us dollars or other foreign currencies while the costs incurred to operate these delivery centers are denominated in the functional currency of the applicable operating subsidiary 
therefore  fluctuations between the currencies of the contracting and operating subsidiary present foreign currency exchange risks 
in addition  because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  and approximately of our revenue is derived from contracts denominated in other currencies  our results of operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies 
while we enter into forward and option contracts collars to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  the foreign exchange exposure between the contracting and operating subsidiaries is not hedged 
since the operating subsidiary assumes the foreign exchange exposure  its operating margins could decrease if the operating subsidiary s currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency 
for example  our operating subsidiaries are at risk if their functional currency strengthens against the contracting subsidiary s currency typically the us dollar 
if the us dollar devalues against the operating subsidiaries functional currency  the financial results of those operating subsidiaries and teletech upon consolidation will be negatively affected 
while our hedging strategy is structured to offset a portion of these foreign currency changes  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully hedge this foreign currency exchange risk or that the value of the us dollar will not materially weaken 
if we fail to manage our foreign currency exchange risk  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk and market risk with respect to financial transactions with our financial institutions the global economic and credit crisis weakened the creditworthiness of many financial institutions  and in some circumstances caused previously financially solvent financial institutions to file for bankruptcy 
the counterparties to our hedge transactions are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions  and we are subject to risks that these counterparties become insolvent and fail to perform their financial obligations under these hedge transactions 
our hedging exposure to counterparty credit risk is not secured by any collateral 
if one or more of the counterparties to one or more of our hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions 
our primary exposure will depend on many factors but  generally  our credit exposure will depend on foreign exchange rate movements relative to the contracted foreign exchange rate and whether any gains result that are not realized due to a counterparty default 
we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of our counterparties 
we also have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions  and interest rate swaps with counterparty banks 
we can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of these financial and other institutions and their ability to fund their obligations when required under our agreements 
our credit facility contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business our credit facility contains operating and financial restrictions and covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and require us to meet certain financial tests 
complying with these covenant restrictions may limit our ability to engage in certain transactions or activities  including incurring additional indebtedness  making certain investments and capital expenditures  acquisitions  selling certain assets  stock repurchases  payment of existing obligations  or replenishment of cash reserves 
as a result of these covenant restrictions  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants may result in a default under our credit facility 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to meet the financial covenants under our debt agreements or  in the event of noncompliance  will be able to obtain waivers or amendments from the lenders 
upon the occurrence of such an event of default  the lenders under our credit facilities could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such credit facilities  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
if the lenders accelerate the payment of the indebtedness under our credit facilities  we cannot assure you that the assets securing such indebtedness would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness  which could have a material and adverse affect on our financial condition 
our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements in which violations or changes could threaten our ability to continue to operate because we provide services to our clients customers  who reside in countries  we are subject to numerous  and sometimes conflicting  legal regimes on matters as diverse as import export controls  content requirements  trade restrictions  tariffs  taxation  sanctions  government affairs  immigration  internal and disclosure control obligations  data privacy and labor relations 
violations of these regulations could result in liability for monetary damages  fines and or criminal prosecution  unfavorable publicity  restrictions on our ability to process information and allegations by our clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations 
changes in us federal  state and international laws and regulations may adversely affect the sale of our services  including expansion of overseas operations 
changes in these regulations and requirements  or new restrictive regulations and requirements  may slow the growth of our services or require us to incur substantial costs 
changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions  such as preventing us from using offshore resources to provide our services  or could impose additional taxes on the provision of our services and solutions 
these changes could threaten our ability to continue to serve certain markets 
closing or consolidating underutilized delivery centers can adversely impact our results of operations from time to time we may consolidate or close underutilized or under performing delivery centers in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in the event we close delivery centers in the future  we may be required to record restructuring or impairment charges  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
our financial results and projections may be impacted by our ability to maintain and find new locations for our delivery centers in countries with stable wage rates our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
as a result  our future growth is dependent upon our ability to find cost effective locations in which to operate  both domestically and internationally 
some of our delivery centers are located in countries that have experienced rising standards of living  which may in turn require us to increase employee wages 
in addition  approximately  employees outside the us are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although we anticipate that the terms of agreements will not impact us in a manner materially different than other companies located in these countries  we may not be able to pass increased labor costs on to our clients 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to find cost effective locations 
any increases in labor costs may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on our senior management and key personnel and we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified professionals our future operating results depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key senior managers and personnel 
in addition  we are dependent on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
however  there is significant competition for employees with the requisite level of experience and qualifications 
if we cannot attract  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  we may be unable to compete effectively and our growth may be limited  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and prospects 
if we fail to recruit  hire  train and retain key qualified employees  our business will be adversely affected our business is labor intensive and places significant importance on our ability to recruit  train  and retain qualified personnel 
demand for qualified management and technical professionals conversant in multiple languages  including english  and or certain technologies may exceed supply  as new and additional skills are required to keep pace with evolving technologies 
we generally experience high employee turnover and are continuously required to recruit and train replacement personnel as a result of a changing and expanding work force 
in addition  certain delivery centers are located in geographic areas with relatively low unemployment rates  which could make it more costly to hire qualified personnel 
our ability to locate and train employees is critical to achieving our growth objective 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel or an increase in wages or other costs of attracting  training  or retaining qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the customer experience markets are highly competitive  and we might not be able to compete effectively which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our ability to compete depends on a number of factors  including our ability to initiate  develop and maintain new client relationships  maintain and expand existing client programs  staff and equip suitable delivery center facilities in a timely manner  differentiate our services from our competitors through the use of technologies and products that are not outdated or obsolete  and develop new solutions and enhance existing solutions we provide to our clients 
moreover  we compete with a variety of companies with respect to our offerings  including large multinational providers  including the service arms of large global technology providers  offshore service providers in lower cost locations that offer services similar to those we offer  often at highly competitive prices  niche solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market  industry segment or service area  and most importantly  the in house operations of clients or potential clients 
because our primary competitors are the in house operations of existing or potential clients  our performance and growth could be adversely affected if our existing or potential clients decide to provide in house customer experience services they currently outsource  or retain or increase their in house customer experience services and product support capabilities 
in addition  competitive pressures from current or future competitors also could cause our services to lose market acceptance or put downward pressure on the prices we charge for our services and on our operating margins 
if we are unable to provide our clients with superior services and solutions at competitive prices  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to develop our services and solutions in response to changes in technology and client demand which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our success depends on our ability to develop and implement systems technology and outsourcing services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry developments and client needs 
our continued growth and future profitability will be highly dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop new technologies that expand our existing solutions and offerings  achieve cost efficiencies in our existing delivery center operations  and introduce new solutions that leverage and respond to changing technological developments 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis 
our integration of new technologies may not achieve their intended cost reductions and services and technologies offered by current or future competitors may make our service offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
our failure to maintain our technological capabilities or to respond effectively to technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
disruption to the company s supply chain for the customer technology services segment could adversely affect our business damage or disruption to the suppliers for the company s customer technology services segment or to the company s distribution capabilities due to weather  natural disaster  fire  terrorism  pandemic  strikes  or other reasons could impair the customer technology services segment s ability to sell its products and services 
failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events  or to effectively manage such events if they occur  particularly when a product is sourced from a single location  could adversely affect our business or financial results 
the products and services utilized by us and our suppliers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others some of our products and services use intellectual property that we own 
we also purchase products and services from suppliers  including device suppliers and service providers that incorporate or utilize intellectual property 
we and some of our suppliers and service providers have received  and may receive in the future  assertions and claims from third parties that the products of software utilized by us or our suppliers and service providers infringe on the patents or other intellectual property rights of these third parties 
these claims could require us or an infringing supplier or service provider to cease certain activities or to cease selling the relevant products and services 
these claims and assertions also could subject us to costly litigation and significant liabilities for damages or royalty payments  or require us to cease certain activities or to cease selling certain products and services 
difficulties in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contractual rights may have an adverse affect business and operations some of the intellectual property developed by us may not receive favorable treatment from the united states patent and trademark office or similar foreign intellectual property adjudication and registration agencies 
intellectual property for which we have a patent pending status may not be granted a patent or may be determined to have been filed later than similar technologies products and services or may be determined to materially conflict with similar technologies  products and services 
due to the varying degrees of development of the legal systems of the countries in which we operate  local laws might be insufficient to protect our contractual and intellectual property rights  among other rights 
all of these factors could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to integrate businesses and assets that we may acquire through joint ventures or acquisitions  we may lose clients and our liquidity  capital resources and profitability may be adversely affected we may pursue strategic acquisitions of companies or strategic alliances in the form of joint ventures and partnerships to obtain services  technologies  industry specializations  or geographic coverage that extend or complement our existing business 
acquisitions and joint ventures often involve a number of special risks  including the following we may encounter difficulties integrating acquired software  operations and personnel and our management s attention could be diverted from other business concerns  we may not be able to successfully incorporate acquired technology and rights into our service offerings and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  the businesses or assets we acquire may fail to achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated  causing us to incur additional debt to fund operations and to impair the assets recorded through our acquisitions  we may assume liabilities associated with the sale of the acquired company s products or services  we may face operational or other limitations on integrating businesses if we do not have a majority or controlling position  our resources may be diverted in asserting and defending our legal rights or in disputes with contract counterparties  and we may ultimately be liable for contingent and other liabilities  not previously disclosed to us  of the companies that we acquire  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and dilute our ownership interest  acquisitions may result in litigation from sellers  former employees or third parties  and due diligence may fail to identify significant issues with product quality  product architecture  ownership rights and legal contingencies  among other matters 
any of the factors identified above could have a material adverse effect on our returns on invested capital  our business and on the market value of our common stock 
the growth of our operations could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer we have made and may continue to plan and execute acquisitions and take other actions to grow our business 
we can provide no assurance that such actions will be undertaken or completed in their entirety as planned 
in addition to the challenges and risks relating to the integration of the acquired businesses  products  or technologies  potential future growth and the diversion of management s time and resources will continue to place a strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
we expect that we will need to continually evaluate and maintain our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to expand  train and manage our workforce worldwide 
we can provide no assurances that we will manage acquisitions successfully 
future acquisitions could cause us to issue dilutive equity or incur debt  contingent liabilities  additional amortization charges from intangible assets  asset impairment charges  or impairment charges for in process research and development and other indefinite lived intangible assets that could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we face risks related to health epidemics  which could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our business could be materially and adversely affected by health epidemics  including  but not limited to  outbreaks of the hn influenza virus commonly known as the swine flu  the avian flu  and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
outbreaks of sars in and and the avian flu in  and alarmed people around the world  raising issues pertaining to health and travel and undermining confidence in the world s economy 
more recently  cases of the hn virus have been identified internationally  including confirmed human outbreaks and deaths 
any prolonged epidemic of the hn virus  avian flu  sars  or other contagious infection in the markets in which we do business may result in worker absences  lower asset utilization rates  voluntary closure of our offices and delivery centers  travel restrictions on our employees  and other disruptions to our business 
moreover  health epidemics may force local health and government authorities to mandate the closure of our offices and delivery centers 
any prolonged or widespread health epidemic could severely disrupt our business operations  result in a significant decrease in demand for our services  and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the adoption and implementation of new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business we enter into forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate fluctuations 
the united states congress has passed  and the president has signed into law  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the financial reform act 
the financial reform act provides for new statutory and regulatory requirements for derivative transactions  including foreign currency and interest rate hedging transactions 
the financial reform act requires the commodities futures and trading commission to promulgate rules relating to the financial reform act 
until the rules relating to the financial reform act are established  we do not know how these regulations will affect us 
the rules adopted by the commodities futures and trading commission may in the future impact our flexibility to execute strategic hedges to reduce foreign exchange and interest rate uncertainty and thus protect cash flows 
in addition  the banks and other derivatives dealers who are our contractual counterparties will be required to comply with the financial reform act s new requirements 
it is possible that the costs of such compliance will be passed on to customers such as ourselves 
our chairman and chief executive officer has control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders kenneth d 
tuchman  our chairman and chief executive officer  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
tuchman could exercise control over all matters requiring action by our stockholders  including the election of our entire board of directors 
therefore  a change in control of our company could not be effected without his approval 
our controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud our management  including our ceo and cfo  believes that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures  no matter how well conceived and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must consider the benefits of controls relative to their costs 
inherent limitations within a control system include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty  and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake 
additionally  controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls 
while the design of any system of controls is to provide reasonable assurance of the effectiveness of disclosure controls  such design is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and such assumptions  while reasonable  may not take into account all potential future conditions 
accordingly  because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and may not be prevented or detected 
failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting may have an adverse effect on our stock price pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission sec to implement section  we are required to furnish a report by our management to include in this form k regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
we have in the past discovered  and may potentially in the future discover  areas of internal control over financial reporting which may require improvement 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective now or in any future period  or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price

in  the municipality of sao paulo  brazil assessed our brazilian subsidiary a services tax on certain equipment rental income earned in and in march  our brazilian subsidiary filed a tax annulment action in the sao paulo municipal court to challenge the assessment of services taxes on rental income

our brazilian subsidiary filed this challenge in the state court of sao paulo which is not bound by the decision of the sao paulo municipal court and where a ruling is not expected for the next one to two years 
based on an opinion received from legal counsel in brazil  the company believes that i the ruling issued by the sao paulo municipal court was incorrect and in contravention of a brazil supreme court ruling concerning the invalidity of services taxes on rental income  ii the brazilian subsidiary has valid defenses against the assessed services taxes and iii that payment of these services taxes is not probable 
accordingly  we have not recorded an expense in the year ended december  for the sao paulo services tax assessment

our offshore delivery centers serve clients based both in north america and in other countries 
our offshore delivery capacity spans five countries with  workstations and currently represents of our global delivery capabilities 
revenue from services provided in these offshore locations was million and represented of our total revenue for  as compared to million and of our total revenue for  with both years excluding revenue from the five acquisitions 
our cash flow from operations and available credit allowed us to finance a significant portion of our capital needs and stock repurchases through internally generated cash flows 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  total debt of million  and a total debt to total capitalization ratio of 
during  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under the stock repurchase program 
since inception of the program through december   the board has authorized the repurchase of shares up to an aggregate value of million  of which we have purchased million shares for million 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers  and  workstations  at december  and  respectively are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs 
december  december  total production workstations in use in use total production workstations in use in use multi client centers sites open year sites open year total multi client centers we continue to see demand from all geographic regions to utilize our offshore delivery capabilities and expect this trend to continue with our clients 
in light of this trend  we plan to continue to selectively retain capacity and expand into new offshore markets 
as we grow our offshore delivery capabilities and our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations increase  we continue to actively manage this risk via a multi currency hedging program designed to minimize operating margin volatility 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  the delivery of service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the bpo inbound and outbound service fees are based on either a per minute  per hour  per transaction or per call basis 
certain client programs provide for adjustments to monthly billings based upon whether we achieve  exceed or fail certain performance criteria 
adjustments to monthly billings consist of contractual bonuses penalties  holdbacks and other performance based contingencies 
revenue recognition is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon delivery of future services or meeting other specified performance conditions 
revenue also consists of services for agent training  program launch  professional consulting  fully hosted or managed technology and learning innovation 
these service offerings may contain multiple element arrangements whereby we determine if those service offerings represent separate units of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has standalone value and delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control 
if those deliverables are determined to be separate units of accounting  revenue is recognized as services are provided 
if those deliverables are not determined to be separate units of accounting  revenue for the delivered services are bundled into one unit of accounting and recognized over the life of the arrangement or at the time all services and deliverables have been delivered and satisfied 
we allocate revenue to each of the deliverables based on a selling price hierarchy of vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  third party evidence  and then estimated selling price 
vsoe is based on the price charged when the deliverable is sold separately 
third party evidence is based on largely interchangeable competitor services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
estimated selling price is based on our best estimate of what the selling prices of deliverables would be if they were sold regularly on a standalone basis 
estimated selling price is established considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices in different geographies  service offerings  and customer classifications 
once we allocate revenue to each deliverable  we recognize revenue when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
periodically  we will make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts or provide up front discounts for future services 
these expenditures are capitalized as contract acquisition costs and amortized in proportion to the expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these costs is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  in determining whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
we follow a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  and settlement of issues under audit 
interest and penalties relating to income taxes and uncertain tax positions are accrued net of tax in provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
in the future  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside our control 
our effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of revenue and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
further  we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
we estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual and forecasted results of subsequent quarters 
consequently  significant changes in our actual quarterly or forecasted results may impact the effective tax rate for the current or future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered to be impaired when the forecasted undiscounted cash flows of an asset group are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
the amount of impairment recognized is the difference between the carrying value of the asset group and its fair value 
fair value estimates are based on assumptions concerning the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows and assumed discount rates 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for possible impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
similar to goodwill  the company may first use a qualitative analysis to assess the realizability of its indefinite lived intangible assets 
the qualitative analysis will include a review of changes in economic  market and industry conditions  business strategy  cost factors  and financial performance  among others  to determine if there would be a significant decline to the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset 
if a quantitative analysis is completed  an indefinite lived intangible asset a trade name is evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
fair value was estimated as the discounted value of future revenues arising from a trade name using a royalty rate that a market participant would pay for use of that trade name 
an impairment charge is recorded if the trade name s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
we use a three step process to assess the realizability of goodwill based on recently adopted accounting guidance 
the first step  step  is a qualitative assessment that analyzes current economic indicators associated with a particular reporting unit 
for example  we analyze changes in economic  market and industry conditions  business strategy  cost factors  and financial performance  among others  to determine if there would be a significant decline to the fair value of a particular reporting unit 
a qualitative assessment also includes analyzing the excess fair value of a reporting unit over its carrying value from impairment assessments performed in previous years 
if the qualitative assessment indicates a stable or improved fair value  no further testing is required 
if a qualitative assessment indicates that a significant decline to fair value of a reporting unit is more likely than not  or if a reporting unit s fair value has historically been closer to its carrying value  we will proceed to step testing where we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on discounted future probability weighted cash flows 
if step indicates that the carrying value of a reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  we will proceed to step where the fair value of the reporting unit will be allocated to assets and liabilities as it would in a business combination 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value calculated in step we estimate fair value using discounted cash flows of the reporting units 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services  projected labor costs  as well as contract negotiation status 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate 
we use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
as of december   the company s assessment of goodwill impairment indicated that for all but one reporting unit  the fair values of the company s reporting units were substantially in excess of their estimated carrying values  and therefore goodwill in these reporting units was not impaired 
for the one reporting unit where fair value is not substantially in excess of carrying value  the likelihood of impairment is greater if there is a change to any of the assumptions used in the calculation of fair value 
refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the assumptions used 
if actual results differ substantially from the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment has occurred 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
severance payments that occur from reductions in workforce are in accordance with postemployment plans and or statutory requirements that are communicated to all employees upon hire date  therefore  we recognize severance liabilities when they are determined to be probable and reasonably estimable 
other liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
equity based compensation expense equity based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant date fair value 
we recognize equity based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate  and recognize compensation expense only for shares that are expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is typically the vesting term of the share based payment award 
we estimate the forfeiture rate annually based on historical experience of forfeited awards 
fair value measurement we determine the fair value of our various assets and liabilities based on a framework which measures fair value 
the framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
we utilize market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  assumptions about counterparty credit risk  including the ability of each party to execute its obligation under the contract  and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to utilize the best available information 
accordingly  we utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
we are able to classify fair value balances based on the observability of those inputs 
the valuation techniques we use establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
level primarily consists of financial instruments such as exchange traded derivatives  listed equities and us government treasury securities 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors  and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument  can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace 
instruments in this category include non exchange traded derivatives such as over the counter forwards  options and repurchase agreements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant 
level instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers needs 
at each balance sheet date  we perform an analysis of all instruments subject to fair value measurements and include in level all of those whose fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs 
derivatives we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that are associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
we enter into interest rate swaps to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our variable rate debt 
upon proper qualification  these contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges under current accounting standards 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our net investment in a foreign operation 
all derivative financial instruments are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  to the extent they are deemed effective 
based on the criteria established by current accounting standards  all of our cash flow hedge contracts are deemed to be highly effective 
changes in fair value of any net investment hedge are recorded in cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets offsetting the change in cumulative translation adjustment attributable to the hedged portion of our net investment in the foreign operation 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the foreign currency cash flow hedges are recognized together with the hedged transactions within revenue 
any realized gains or losses resulting from the interest rate swaps are recognized in interest income expense 
gains and losses from the settlements of our net investment hedges remain in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until partial or complete liquidation of the applicable net investment 
we also enter into fair value derivative contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with changes in asset and liability balances 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges affect the carrying value of the asset or liability hedged  with changes in both the derivative instrument and the hedged asset or liability being recognized in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
while we expect that our derivative instruments will continue to be highly effective and in compliance with applicable accounting standards  if our hedges did not qualify as highly effective or if we determine that forecasted transactions will not occur  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected currently in earnings 
contingencies we record a liability for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally include costs incurred in connection with our customer management services  including direct labor  telecommunications  technology costs  printing  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with the delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes outside professional fees ie  legal and accounting services  building expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our debts and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous income not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction losses 
presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also includes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  plant and equipment free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment for the years ended december    and are net of proceeds from a government grant of million  million  and zero  respectively 
we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the tables included in the following sections are presented to facilitate an understanding of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and present certain information by segment for the years ended december  and amounts in thousands 
all inter company transactions between the reported segments for the periods presented have been eliminated 
customer management services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the decrease in revenue for the customer management services segment was attributable to a million net increase in client programs offset by a million reduction related to the exit of certain unprofitable programs including our business in spain  program completions of million  and a million decrease in realized gains on cash flow hedges and negative changes in foreign exchange translation 
the operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to in as compared to in during  we recorded million in restructuring and impairment charges as a result of our decision to exit spain and an incremental million in restructuring charges and impairment in other locations to better align our capacity and workforce with the current business needs 
these charges were offset in part by increases in margins based on the rationalization of unprofitable programs as described above and the related reduction in capacity 
the margin also benefited from a million accrual release for salaries expense due to an authoritative ruling in spain related to the legally required cost of living adjustments for our employees salaries  a million decrease in depreciation expense related to assets which are now fully depreciated  and million related to the finalization of certain real estate and employee related expenses 
customer growth services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer growth services segment was due to a net increase in client programs of million offset by program completions of million 
the operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decline was primarily due to a million charge related to the impairment of the trade name intangible asset due to the rebranding of our direct alliance subsidiary to revana during the first quarter of  other expenses incurred in connection with this rebranding  and increases in employee related expenses including salaries and benefits 
customer technology services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer technology services segment was primarily related to a full year of operations for our acquisition of eloyalty corporation eloyalty which occurred on may  the operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease was related to the acquisition of eloyalty as discussed above which results in a change in the mix of revenue from purely hosted solutions to both hosted and managed solutions 
there were also investments in sales and marketing and additional amortization expense for the customer relationship asset related to the acquisition of eloyalty 
customer strategy services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer strategy services segment was due to an million increase due to the acquisition of iknowtion  llc iknowtion and guidon performance solutions guidon and a million net increase in consulting revenue partially offset by a million decrease due to negative changes in foreign exchange translations 
the operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease was related to an increased investment in geographic expansion  additional amortization expense for the customer relationship assets of iknowtion and guidon and negative changes in foreign exchange translation  offset partially by the acquisitions of iknowtion and guidon 
other income expense for  interest income decreased to million from million in interest expense increased to million during from million during this increase was due to a higher outstanding balance on our credit facility and additional expense related to the interest rate swap arrangements 
income taxes the reported effective tax rate for was as compared to for the effective tax rate for was impacted by earnings in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday  and a million tax benefit related to australia and new zealand transfer pricing  a million benefit from the release of uncertain tax positions  a million benefit related to restructuring charges  a million benefit related to return to provision adjustments and million of expense related to other discrete items 
without these items our effective tax rate for the year ended december  would have been 
in the year ended december   our effective tax rate would have been without a million expense related to the adverse decision by the canada revenue agency regarding our request for relief from double taxation  a million benefit related to our mediated settlement with the irs related to us tax refund claims  a million benefit related to the foreign earnings repatriation and a million benefit for other discrete items recognized during the period

all inter company transactions between the reported segments for the periods presented have been eliminated 
customer management services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the decrease in revenue for the customer management services segment was attributable to a million net increase in client programs and a million increase in realized gains on cash flow hedges and changes in foreign exchange translation  offset by program completions of million 
the operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to for as compared to in during  we recorded million in restructuring charges to better align our capacity and workforce with the current business needs as compared to million during the increase in operating income was also due to an million decrease in depreciation expense related to assets which are now fully depreciated and decreases in telecommunication and facility and occupancy expenses 
customer growth services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer growth services segment was due to a net increase in client programs of million partially offset by program completions of million 
the operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to in as compared to in this increase was directly attributable to the revenue increase noted above 
customer technology services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer technology services segment was related to the acquisition of eloyalty on may  the operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased to in as compared to in this decrease was related to the acquisition of eloyalty as discussed above which results in a change in the mix of revenue from purely hosted solutions to both hosted and managed solutions 
there were also additional investments in sales and marketing and additional amortization expense for the customer relationship asset related to the acquisition of eloyalty 
customer strategy services year ended december  change change revenue operating income the increase in revenue for the customer strategy services segment was due to the acquisition of peppers rogers group in november  the operating income as a percentage of revenue increased to for as compared to in this increase was related to the acquisition of peppers rogers as described above 
other income expense for  interest income increased to million from million in  primarily due to higher cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest expense increased to million during from million during this increase was due to a higher outstanding balance on our credit facility 
other income expense decreased during as a result of the settlement of a newgen results corporation legal claim which resulted in a gain of million in see note to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was as compared to an effective tax rate of in the effective tax rate was negatively influenced by an adverse decision by the canada revenue agency regarding the company s request for relief from double taxation  and benefitted from a mediated settlement with the irs related to us tax refund claims  a reduction in the incremental us tax expense versus the estimate recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the company s repatriation of million of foreign earnings  earnings reported in international jurisdictions currently under an income tax holiday  and the distribution of income between the us and international tax jurisdictions 
without the million expense related to the adverse decision by the canada revenue agency regarding the company s request for relief from double taxation  the million benefit related to the company s mediated settlement with the irs related to us tax refund claims  the million benefit related to the foreign earnings repatriation  and million benefit for other discrete items recognized during the period  the company s effective tax rate for would have been 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations  our cash and cash equivalents  and borrowings under our credit agreement  dated october  as amended march  the credit agreement 
during the year ended december   we generated positive operating cash flows of million 
we believe that our cash generated from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents  and available credit will be sufficient to meet expected operating and capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
we manage a centralized global treasury function in the united states with a focus on concentrating and safeguarding our global cash and cash equivalents 
while the majority of our cash is held offshore  we prefer to hold us dollars in addition to the local currencies of our foreign subsidiaries 
we expect to use our offshore cash to support working capital and growth of our foreign operations 
while there are no assurances  we believe our global cash is protected given our cash management practices  banking partners  and utilization of diversified  high quality investments 
we have global operations that expose us to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that may positively or negatively impact our liquidity 
we are also exposed to higher interest rates associated with our variable rate debt 
to mitigate these risks  we enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps through our cash flow hedging program 
please refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  foreign currency risk  for further discussion 
we primarily utilize our credit agreement to fund working capital  general operations  stock repurchases and other strategic activities  such as the acquisitions described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and december   we had borrowings of million and million  respectively  under our credit agreement  and our average daily utilization was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
after consideration for issued letters of credit under the credit agreement  totaling million  our remaining borrowing capacity was million as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions under our credit agreement 
the amount of capital required over the next months will depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade or replace existing assets 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital through future debt or equity financing 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital upon commercially reasonable terms acceptable to us 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december    and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their original maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we diversify the holdings of such cash and cash equivalents considering the financial condition and stability of the counterparty institutions 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business for strategic acquisitions and for the purchase of our outstanding stock 
for the years  and we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million from to was primarily due to incremental cash paid of million for prepaid and other assets and a decrease in cash from net income of million offset by increases in prepayments from customers of million  increases in cash collected from accounts receivable of million  and an increase of million in payments made for operating expenses 
the net decrease from to was primarily due to a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses  which includes the payment of million for income taxes  and a million decrease in the collection of accounts receivable  offset by a million increase in net income 
cash flows from investing activities we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the net decrease in cash used from investing activities from to was primarily due to the million decrease in acquisition related spending offset by a million increase in capital expenditures 
the net increase in cash used from investing activities from to was primarily due to the million payment for the acquisition of eloyalty  and a million increase in net capital expenditures  offset by a million decrease from the million payment for the acquisition of peppers rogers group during cash flows from financing activities for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the change from to was due to a decrease in net borrowings on our line of credit of million  an increase in cash used to repurchase common stock of million and a decrease in cash received from the exercise of stock options of million 
the change from to was due to an increase in net borrowings on our line of credit of million and a decrease in cash used to repurchase common stock of million 
free cash flow free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements above for the definition of free cash flow was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the decrease from to resulted primarily from the million decrease in cash flow from operating activities and a million increase in capital expenditures  net of grant monies received 
the decrease from to resulted from the million decrease in cash flow from operating activities and a million increase in capital expenditures 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations as of december  are summarized as follows amounts in thousands less than year to years to years over years total credit facility equipment financing arrangements contingent consideration purchase obligations operating lease commitments total includes estimated interest payments based on the weighted average interest rate  unused commitment fees  current interest rate swap arrangements  and outstanding debt as of december  contractual obligations to be paid in a foreign currency are translated at the period end exchange rate 
purchase obligations primarily consist of outstanding purchase orders for goods or services not yet received  which are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets until such goods and or services are received 
the contractual obligation table excludes our liabilities of million related to uncertain tax positions because we cannot reliably estimate the timing of future cash payments 
see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the contractual obligations table excludes the contingent consideration arrangement associated with the prg acquisition as we have estimated this liability to be zero at december  as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients to provide us with telecommunication services 
these clients currently represent approximately of our total annual revenue 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arm s length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be within the range of to million 
approximately of these expected capital expenditures are to support growth in our business and relates to the maintenance for existing assets 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
our capital expenditures requirements could also increase materially in the event of acquisition or joint ventures 
in addition  as of december   we were authorized to purchase an additional million of common stock under our stock repurchase program see item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities in this form k 
the stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date 
the launch of large client contracts may result in short term negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants on october   we entered into the credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by keybank national association  wells fargo bank  national association  bank of america  na  bbva compass  and jpmorgan chase bank  na on march   we amended the credit agreement by increasing the aggregate commitment by million to million and revising certain definitions 
the credit agreement provides for a secured revolving credit facility that matures on september  with a maximum aggregate commitment of million

client concentration during  one of our clients represented of our total annual revenue 
our five largest clients accounted for  and of our annual revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have long term relationships with our top five clients  ranging from six to years  with the majority of these clients having completed multiple contract renewals with teletech 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis and varies greatly based upon specific contract terms 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  we believe this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions and transition migration costs that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and additionally  a particular client may have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed or  if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
market risk also includes credit and non performance risk by counterparties to our various financial instruments 
we are exposed to market risks due to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar  as well as credit risk associated with potential non performance of our counterparty banks 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
we enter into derivative instruments to manage and reduce the impact of currency exchange rate changes  primarily between the us dollar canadian dollar  the us dollar philippine peso  the us dollar mexican peso  and the australian dollar philippine peso 
we enter into interest rate derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt 
to mitigate against credit and non performance risk  it is our policy to only enter into derivative contracts and other financial instruments with investment grade counterparty financial institutions and  correspondingly  our derivative valuations reflect the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
as of the date of this report  we have not experienced  nor do we anticipate  any issue related to derivative counterparty defaults 
interest rate risk we entered into interest rate derivative instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our variable rate debt 
the interest rate on our credit agreement is variable based upon the prime rate and libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
based upon average daily outstanding borrowings during the years ended december  and  interest accrued at a rate of approximately per annum 
if the prime rate or libor increased by basis points during the quarter  there would not have been a material impact to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company s interest rate swap arrangements as of december  and were as follows notional amount variable rate received fixed rate paid contract commencement date contract maturity date as of december  million month libor april april and million month libor may may million foreign currency risk our subsidiaries in argentina  canada  costa rica  mexico  and the philippines use the local currency as their functional currency for paying labor and other operating costs 
conversely  revenue for these foreign subsidiaries is derived principally from client contracts that are invoiced and collected in us dollars or other foreign currencies 
as a result  we may experience foreign currency gains or losses  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december   and  revenue associated with this foreign exchange risk was  and of our consolidated revenue  respectively

australian dollar in order to mitigate the risk of these non functional foreign currencies weakening against the functional currencies of the servicing subsidiaries  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of the projected foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries through our cash flow hedging program 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall weakening of the non functional foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the servicing subsidiary over the long term 
cash flow hedging program to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with forecasted revenue in non functional currencies  we purchase forward and or option contracts to acquire the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary at a fixed exchange rate at specific dates in the future 
we have designated and account for these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges for forecasted revenue in non functional currencies 
while we have implemented certain strategies to mitigate risks related to the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates  we cannot ensure that we will not recognize gains or losses from international transactions  as this is part of transacting business in an international environment 
not every exposure is or can be hedged and  where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign exchange exposure  they are based on forecasts for which actual results may differ from the original estimate 
failure to successfully hedge or anticipate currency risks properly could adversely affect our consolidated operating results 
our cash flow hedging instruments as of december  and are summarized as follows amounts in thousands 
all hedging instruments are forward contracts  except as noted 
as of december  local currency notional amount us dollar notional amount maturing in contracts maturing through canadian dollar march philippine peso june mexican peso december british pound sterling june new zealand dollars june as of december  local currency notional amount us dollar notional amount canadian dollar costa rican colon philippine peso mexican peso forwards mexican peso collars british pound sterling includes contracts to purchase philippine pesos in exchange for new zealand dollars and australian dollars  which are translated into equivalent us dollars on december  and december  includes contracts to purchase british pound sterling in exchange for euros  which are translated into equivalent us dollars on december  and december  the mexican peso collars include call options with a floor total of mxn million and put options with a cap total of mxn million as of december  the fair value of our cash flow hedges at december  was assets liabilities amounts in thousands december  maturing in canadian dollar philippine peso mexican peso british pound sterling new zealand dollar our cash flow hedges are valued using models based on market observable inputs  including both forward and spot foreign exchange rates  implied volatility  and counterparty credit risk 
the decrease in fair value largely reflects the recent global economic conditions which resulted in high foreign exchange volatility and a broad strengthening in the us dollar 
we recorded net gains of million  million  and million for settled cash flow hedge contracts and the related premiums for the years ended december    and  respectively 
these gains were reflected in revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
if the exchange rates between our various currency pairs were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding increases or decreases in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in their respective local currency 
however  transactions are denominated in other currencies from time to time 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis 
for the years ended and  approximately and  respectively  of revenue was derived from contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our results from operations and revenue could be adversely affected if the us dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies
