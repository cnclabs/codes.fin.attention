item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  industrial  military  medical  and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of one segment the manufacturing and distribution of displays and display components 
the company is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of fasb asc topic segment reporting monitors offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical  and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
this division was closed in february and remaining inventory was moved to the data display crts tucker location 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
this division was closed in february and the remaining inventory was transferred to the company s crt manufacturing operation in lexington  kentucky 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to dispose of unprofitable operations and seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averaged days during fiscal  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors because it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the company also maintains inventory for warranty repairs and replacements for products out in the field which are no longer in its current products 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million and million  as of february  and february   respectively  subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively affect the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges 
operations the following table sets forth  for the fiscal years indicated  the percentages that selected items in the company s consolidated statements of operations bear to total revenues amounts in thousands 
table of contents see item business description of principal business and principal products for discussion about the company s products and divisions 
amount amount net sales monitors data display crts entertainment crts component parts total company costs and expenses cost of goods sold selling and delivery general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the company s business is more concentrated in the monitor division of the company where all the new growth is occurring as the market for crts declines and moves to newer technologies 
the company is now a video display solutions company  while it still services the existing crt markets  which overall account for approximately of the company s revenues 
the monitor revenues decreased million due to the delay of long term contracts at aydin displays and a slowdown in z axis custom manufacturing and power supply sales due to the leveling off of business at its two largest customers  one in custom manufacturing and one in power supplies 
overall  aydin displays revenues decreased over the prior fiscal year to million and z axis decreased in net revenues to million over the prior fiscal year 
display systems business was down from the prior fiscal year as it transitions from selling and refurbishing crts to developing and selling digital display solutions 
lexel experienced a decline in revenues due to a decline in orders for various types of its crt business 
lexel is expected to rebound in fiscal due to foreign sales projections which were down in fiscal data display crt sales in fiscal declined due to decreased demand in the crt market including the division s largest customer 
entertainment crt and component parts net sales declined by a combined in fiscal compared to fiscal the two divisions represent only of the company s revenues for fiscal the two divisions were both closed at the end of the fiscal year ended february  the remaining inventory for the entertainment division was transferred to the display division in tucker  georgia and the remaining inventory for the component parts division was transferred to the company s crt manufacturing operation in lexington  kentucky 
due to the continued shift to flat screen televisions  the market for replacement crts in the consumer market has diminished 
component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
this business will continue to decline as the crt industry moves to the new technologies 
the division primarily supplies the other divisions with parts they need to complete the assembly of their products 

table of contents gross margins consolidated gross margins decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal overall gross margin dollars decreased by million or versus the prior fiscal year 
the company s reductions in gross margins were a direct reflection of the decreased revenues which were across the board at all divisions 
million of the million dollar decrease was due to the decrease in the gross margin percentage caused somewhat by product mix and by the fixed costs of production 
the remaining million dollar decrease was due to the decreased sales of million dollars 
the company had two divisions which heavily contributed to the decrease in the gross margin percentage decrease  display systems in cape canaveral and a new division  aydin cyber security in palm bay  florida 
display systems gross margin percentage decreased and aydin cyber security posted a negative gross margin 
both divisions are expected to improve on those numbers as new  better margin business is forecasted 
the aydin displays and z axis divisions are primarily the cause of the overall decrease in gross margin dollars 
both divisions maintained or improved their gross margin percentage  but due to their decrease in sales their gross margin dollars decreased and respectively 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily reflecting increases in sales salaries and outside contractors 
the higher salaries are attributable to increases in additional sales people including the new divisions  aydin visual solutions full year and aydin cybersecurity 
the outside contractors increased due to certain government contracts the company was pursuing 
the percentage increase was also attributed to the lower sales volume 
although operating expenses increased as a percentage to sales  overall operating expenses decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal the company believes it can maintain the fixed operating costs at current levels and the variable costs  such as commissions will increase as revenues increase but in an orderly manner 
plant closure as of february   the company closed its novatron facility in bossier city  louisiana  a distributor of entertainment crts  and southwest vacuum systems  a manufacturer of electron guns and other components for crts 
the remaining inventory and crt related operations were moved to the company s lexel imaging systems subsidiary in lexington  kentucky where they will continue to be manufactured and its data displays distribution facility in tucker  georgia 
as of february   the company closed its clinton displays facility in loves park  illinois  a manufacturer of crts 
the remaining inventory and crt related operations were moved to the company s lexel imaging systems subsidiary in lexington  kentucky where they will continue to be manufactured and its data displays distribution facility in tucker  georgia 
the operating loss generated by clinton displays for the year ended february  was approximately million and is included in the company s results from operations for fiscal interest expense interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal overall  interest expense decreased by million as the company reduced debt by nearly million during the current fiscal year 
the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
the company s interest expense will increase during the first two quarters of the upcoming fiscal year until it can reach a more favorable bank agreement with another bank 

table of contents income taxes the company had net loss before taxes of approximately thousand dollars and an income benefit of approximately thousand dollars for fiscal or a rate of  compared to a tax expense of million or a rate for fiscal on net income before taxes of million dollars 
liquidity and capital resources as of february   the company was not in compliance with the fixed charge coverage ratio  the senior funded debt to ebitda ratio which the company believes is the most restrictive covenant and permitted share repurchases covenants as defined by the banks credit line agreements 
the breach of these covenants resulted in a default under our debt agreement and a current classification of the loans earlier in this fiscal year 
this default could prompt the lender to declare all amounts outstanding under the debt agreement to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit  however  the banks have given no current indication of any intention of calling the loans 
if the debts were called and the company was unable to repay those amounts  the lender could proceed against the collateral granted to secure that indebtedness 
if the lender under the debt agreement accelerates the repayment of the borrowings  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient assets and funds to repay the borrowings under its debt agreements 
additionally  due to the activity generated by the chairman s remarks at the annual shareholder meeting concerning any potential mergers  spinoffs  sale of the company as a whole or any other method see k  the company put negotiations on hold with the current syndication of banks 
as the current syndication of banks has given no indication of calling the loans  management believes the most appropriate plan of action is to continue to operate the company  while exploring those options mentioned by the chairman above  and to continue to make timely and current payments under the debt agreements 
management has forecast this plan and believes that in the absence of the current syndication calling the loans  it can operate in this manner 
the company believes conditions are improving throughout all the divisions and has seen significant activity in new quotes and business won 
management  while operating as noted above  is exploring opportunities for potential mergers  spinoffs  sale of the company as a whole or other methods 
in the absence of obtaining new funding and or any potential mergers  spinoffs  sale of the company as a whole or any other method  management believes continuing and newly generated business as well as ceo s commitment to infuse additional capital  if needed  will sustain the company going forward 
as the debt is maturing on december  and classified as current  the need for refinancing exists 
therefore  the company has resumed talks with other banks about refinancing the current debt under an agreement with less restrictive covenants and borrowing base calculations 
management believes that a new debt agreement can be obtained by the end of the second quarter of fiscal  however  there can be no assurance that an agreement can be reached that is reasonable to the company or at all 
at february  and february   the company had total cash of million and million  respectively 
the company s working capital was and million at february  and february   respectively 
the reduction in working capital is caused by the classification of the bank debt as all current  which causes a reduction in working capital of million 
in recent years  the company has financed its growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations  borrowings under revolving credit facilities  borrowings from its ceo and long term debt 
the company specializes in certain products representing trailing edge technology that may not be available from other sources  and may not be manufactured currently 
in many instances  the company s products are components of larger display systems for which immediate availability is critical for the customer 
accordingly  the company enjoys higher gross margins  but typically has larger investments in inventories than those of its competitors 
the company continually monitors its cash and financing positions in order to find ways to lower its interest costs and to produce positive operating cash flow 
the company examines possibilities to grow its business through internal sales growth or niche acquisitions 
there could be an impact on working capital requirements to fund this growth 
as in the past  the intent is to finance such projects with operating cash flows or existing bank lines  however  more permanent sources of capital may be required in certain circumstances 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal and million in fiscal of this  million was from the operating activities of the company due primarily to the reduction of inventory reserves of million and depreciation and amortization of million offset by the change in deferred taxes of million and other small changes totaling million 
during fiscal  net working capital items decreased by million 
the primary changes were an increase in inventory of million that resulted from the company s two new divisions inventories partially off set by write offs of previously reserved inventories and a million increase in accounts payable due to tighter credit restrictions with the company s line of credit causing a need to slow payments to vendors 
there were also decreases in accounts receivables million  cost in excess of billings million  income taxes refundable million and prepaid expenses million 
investing activities used cash of million in fiscal and used million of cash in fiscal investing activities in fiscal consisted of capital expenditures of million offset by the redemption of a note for million 
during fiscal the use of a letter of credit purchased in fiscal provided million which was offset by capital expenditures of million for used equipment by z axis  aydin displays and lexel imaging  million payment for the settlement of clinton and million for the purchase of a note receivable for stingray the company does not anticipate significant investments in capital assets for fiscal beyond normal maintenance requirements 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal and million during fiscal primarily to pay down debt 
on december   the company and its subsidiaries executed a credit agreement with rbc bank and community southern bank collectively  the banks to provide financing to the company to replace the prior credit agreement with rbc bank that terminated in conjunction with this agreement

the million term loan is secured by real estate property of the company and a building owned by southeastern metro savings  llc  a company in which the company s chief executive officer is a minority officer 
the building will continue to be in the collateral pool until such time as the note is sufficiently paid down or it is replaced by other collateral 
the agreement contains three covenants  as amended a fixed charge coverage ratio  ratio of senior funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  and total liabilities to tangible net worth 
the agreement also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt or liens  investments including company stock  as amended  divestitures and certain other changes in the business 
the agreement expires on december  the interest rate on these loans is a floating libor rate based on a fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum  as defined in the loan documents 
the company has a stock repurchase program  pursuant to which it was originally authorized to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock in the open market 
on july   the board of directors of the company approved a one time continuation of the stock repurchase program  and authorized the company to repurchase up to  additional shares of the company s common stock  depending on the market price of the shares

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory 
table of contents levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oems  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal and  the company disposed of million and million of inventory  respectively 
the disposals during fiscal year were primarily at the company s lexel crt plant  million  other divisions disposed of approximately million of unusable parts 
during fiscal year disposals were due to several factors 
million of inventory was disposed of at the company s clinton displays facility  million was disposed of after the settlement agreement was reached with clinton electronics corporation see note and the remainder when the company closed the plant in february data display disposed of million with the majority of the disposals being attributed to inventory it acquired from the company s former subsidiary  fox international  ltd  inc before its sale to fi acquisition  llc on march  see note 
the company s aydin displays and vdcds divisions each disposed of million 
other divisions disposed of million of inventory 
of the million of inventory disposed of during the year  million was previously included in the inventory reserve 
analysis of the inventory determined there was no longer a need for some of the inventory and it was better to dispose of it for tax purposes and free up valuable space 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collect ability can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with fasb asc topic revenue recognition principal agent considerations  shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of income 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of income 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture display systems to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of fasb asc topic revenue recognition construction type and production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims  or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 
warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 

table of contents other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired and accounted for under the purchase method 
under this standard  goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized and evaluated annually for impairment 
if the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value  then it applies the processes prescribed in fasb asc topic intangible assets and fasb asc topic property  plant  and equipment 
we make certain estimates and projections in connection with impairment analyses for goodwill and other long term assets 
if these estimates or projections change or prove incorrect  we may be required to record impairment charges 
if these impairment charges were significant  our consolidated financial position or results of operations would be adversely affected 
management has assessed the company s intangible assets and has not recognized any impairment of assets for the twelve months ended february  income taxes deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of asc topic  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of asc topic asc topic 
asc topic contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not  that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount  which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating the company s tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments 
at february   the company did not record any liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements there are no recent accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financials 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a decrease of approximately  in pre tax income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
