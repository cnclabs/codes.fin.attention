also in  the company sold their interest in the south vacuum property at a gain of  liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable and impairment offset by changes in net income and increased depletion and deferred income tax expenses

as of december   the company had working capital of approximately million and approximately million borrowing capacity under its line of credit based on a borrowing base of million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination based on the value of proved reserves  and could be increased or decreased during although the company had no significant commitments for capital expenditures at december   management anticipates continued investments in oil and natural gas properties during if bank credit is not available  fieldpoint may not be able to continue to invest in strategic oil and natural gas properties 
management cannot predict how oil and natural gas prices will fluctuate during and what effect they will ultimately have on the company  but management believes that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to service its bank debt and provide for maintaining current production of its oil and natural gas properties 
the timing of most capital expenditures is relatively discretionary 
therefore  the company can plan expenditures to coincide with available funds in order to minimize business risks
