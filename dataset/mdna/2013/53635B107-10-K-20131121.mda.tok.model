we believe our ability to optimize our clients net recovery and supply chain for surplus and salvage assets generates a continuous flow of goods from our corporate and government sellers 
this valuable and reliable flow of goods in turn attracts an increasing number of professional buyers to our marketplaces 
during fiscal year  the number of registered buyers grew from approximately  to approximately  or 
during the past three fiscal years  we have conducted over  online transactions generating approximately billion in gross merchandise volume or gmv 
we believe the continuous flow of goods in our marketplaces attracts a growing buyer base which creates a virtual cycle for our buyers and sellers 
our history 
we were incorporated in delaware in november as liquidation 
com  inc and commenced operations in early during  we developed our online auction marketplace platform and began auctioning merchandise primarily for small commercial sellers and government agencies 
in  we changed our name to liquidity services  inc in june  we were awarded our first major dod contract  the surplus contract 
under this agreement  we became the exclusive contractor with the dla disposition services  for the sale of usable dod surplus assets in the united states 
in june  we were awarded an additional exclusive contract with the dla disposition services to manage and sell substantially all dod scrap property 
during  we opened our first distribution center in dallas  texas and began serving the reverse logistics needs of top retailers 
recent initiatives 
during fiscal year  we made significant progress implementing our restructuring plan for goindustry  which we acquired in july we closed non performing locations and rationalized the remaining supporting infrastructure  while maintaining key elements of the organization that have consistently provided a high level of service to our fortune clients 
we believe these changes will enable the goindustry marketplace to achieve profitable operations in fiscal year on november   we completed the acquisition of the assets of national electronic service association nesa 
the acquisition price included an upfront cash payment of approximately  and an earn out payment 
under the terms of the agreement  the earn out is based on ebitda earned by nesa during the months after closing 
our estimate of the fair value of the 
table of contents earn out as of the date of acquisition was million 
nesa is a canadian provider of returns management  refurbishment and reverse logistics services for high value consumer products 
nesa provides expertise and focused services to fortune companies in the management of consumer electronics  telecommunications  and information technology products 
we continue to integrate nesa according to our original implementation plan  which is on schedule 
our revenue 
we generate substantially all of our revenue by retaining a percentage of the proceeds from the sales we manage for our sellers 
we offer our sellers three primary transaction models a profit sharing model  a consignment model and a purchase model 
profit sharing model 
under our profit sharing model  we purchase inventory from our suppliers and share with them a portion of the profits received from a completed sale in the form of a distribution 
distributions are calculated based on the value received from the sale after deducting direct costs  such as sales and marketing  technology and operations and other general and administrative costs 
because we are the primary obligor  and take general and physical inventory risks and credit risk under this transaction model  we recognize as revenue the sale price paid by the buyer upon completion of a transaction 
revenue from our profit sharing model accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the merchandise sold under our profit sharing model accounted for approximately   and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
consignment model fee revenue 
under our consignment model  we recognize commission revenue from sales of merchandise in our marketplaces that is owned by others 
these commissions  which we refer to as seller commissions  represent a percentage of the sale price the buyer pays upon completion of a transaction 
we vary the percentage amount of the seller commission depending on the various value added services we provide to the seller to facilitate the transaction 
for example  we generally increase the percentage amount of the commission if we take possession  handle  ship and or provide enhanced product information for the merchandise 
we collect the seller commission by deducting the appropriate amount from the sales proceeds prior to their distribution to the seller after completion of the transaction 
revenue from our consignment model  as well as other fee revenue  accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively  and is recorded as fee revenue in the consolidated statement of operations 
the merchandise sold under our consignment model accounted for approximately   and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
purchase model 
under our purchase model  we offer our sellers a fixed amount or the option to share a portion of the proceeds received from our completed sales in the form of a distribution 
distributions are calculated based on the value we receive from the sale after deducting a required return to us that we have negotiated with the seller 
because we are the primary obligor  and take general and physical inventory risks and credit risk under this transaction model  we recognize as revenue the sale price paid by the buyer upon completion of a transaction 
revenue from our purchase model accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the merchandise sold under our purchase model accounted for approximately   and of our gmv  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we collect a buyer premium on substantially all of our transactions under all of our transaction models 
buyer premiums are calculated as a percentage of the sale price of the merchandise sold and 
table of contents are paid to us by the buyer 
buyer premiums are in addition to the price of the merchandise 
under our profit sharing model  we typically share the proceeds of any buyer premiums with our sellers 
industry trends 
we believe there are several industry trends impacting the growth of our business including the increase in the adoption of the internet by businesses to conduct e commerce both in the united states and abroad  in the long term product innovation in the retail supply chain has increased the pace of product obsolescence and  therefore  the supply of surplus assets  the increase in the volume of returned merchandise handled by both online and offline retailers  the increase in government regulations and the need for corporations to have sustainability solutions necessitating verifiable recycling and remarketing of surplus assets  the increase in outsourcing by corporate and government organizations of disposition activities for surplus and end of life assets  as a result of the economic downturn  an increase in buyer demand for surplus merchandise as consumers trade down by purchasing less expensive goods and seek greater value from their purchases  which results in lower per unit prices and margins in our retail goods marketplace  and in the near term  the decrease in the volume and price of consumer electronic products  resulting in lower supply from our retail clients and lower per unit prices and margins in our retail goods marketplace 
our seller agreements our dod agreements 
we have two contracts with the dod pursuant to which we acquire  manage and sell excess property surplus contract 
in june  we were awarded the surplus contract  a competitive bid exclusive contract under which we acquire  manage and sell all usable dod surplus personal property turned into the dla disposition services 
surplus property generally consists of items determined by the dod to be no longer needed  and not claimed for reuse by  any federal agency  such as computers  electronics  office supplies  scientific and medical equipment  aircraft parts  clothing and textiles 
revenue from our surplus contract including buyer premiums accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the property sold under our surplus contract accounted for approximately   and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
on november   the dod extended the original surplus contract through december  we executed the new contract on december  the new surplus contract base term expired in february  subject to dod right to extend it for two additional one year terms 
the dod has exercised both renewal options  and has initiated a request for proposal rfp process for the next surplus contract  which process was suspended in november we continue to provide services under our existing contract 
scrap contract 
in june  we were awarded a competitive bid exclusive contract under which we acquire  manage and sell substantially all scrap property of the dod turned into the dla disposition services 
scrap property generally consists of items determined by the dod to have no use beyond their base material content  such as metals  alloys  and building materials 
revenue from our scrap contract including buyer premiums accounted for approximately   and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the property sold under our scrap contract accounted for approximately   and of our gmv for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we were required to pay million to the dod in fiscal for the right to manage the operations and remarket scrap material in connection with the scrap contract 
the scrap contract base term expired in august  subject to dod right to extend it for three additional one year terms 
the dod has exercised the first two renewal options 

table of contents under the scrap contract  we acquire scrap property at a per pound price and we are entitled to of the profits of sale defined as gross proceeds of sale less allowable operating expenses and distribute the remaining profits to dod 
we refer to these disbursement payments to dod as profit sharing distributions 
as a result of this arrangement  we recognize as revenue the gross proceeds from these sales 
dod also reimburses us for actual costs incurred for packing  loading and shipping property under the scrap contract that we are obligated to pick up from non dod locations 
under the surplus contract  executed on december   we are not required to distribute any portion of the profits realized under the contract  as the new contract contains a higher fixed percentage price of of the dla disposition services acquisition value to be paid for the property 
the dod has broad discretion to determine what property will be made available for sale to us under the surplus contract and may retrieve or restrict property previously sold to us for national security reasons or if the property is otherwise needed to support the mission of the dod 
under the scrap contract  we also have a small business performance incentive based on the number of scrap buyers that are small businesses that would allow us to receive up to an additional of the profit sharing distribution 
the profit sharing distribution for the scrap contract is and includes inventory assurance processes and procedures with respect to the mutilation of demilitarized scrap property sold 
our commercial agreements 
in connection with our acquisition of jacobs trading  llc jacobs on october   we assumed the rights and obligations under a master merchandise salvage contract the wal mart agreement 
we have the exclusive right to purchase certain consumer products from wal mart that have been removed from the sales stream of its retail operations and we believe this agreement will be the source of a significant portion of our revenue and gmv during its term  which expires on may  and thereafter continues on a month to month basis 
in addition  we have other contracts programs with wal mart 
for the year ended september   approximately of our gmv was generated from wal mart under multiple contracts programs 
during fiscal year  we had over corporate clients who each sold in excess of  of surplus and salvage assets in our marketplaces 
our agreements with these clients are generally terminable at will by either party 
key business metrics our management periodically reviews certain key business metrics for operational planning purposes and to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocation of resources and our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our business 
these key business metrics include gross merchandise volume 
gross merchandise volume  or gmv  is the total sales value of all merchandise sold through our marketplaces during a given period 
we review gmv because it provides a measure of the volume of goods being sold in our marketplaces and thus the activity of those marketplaces 
gmv also provides a means to evaluate the effectiveness of investments that we have made and continue to make  including in the areas of customer support  value added services  product development  sales and marketing  and operations 
the gmv of goods sold in our marketplace during fiscal year totaled million 
completed transactions 
completed transactions represents the number of auctions in a given period from which we have recorded revenue 
similar to gmv  we believe that completed transactions is a key business metric because it provides an additional measurement of the volume of activity flowing through our marketplaces 
during the fiscal year ended september   we completed approximately  transactions 

table of contents total registered buyers 
we grow our buyer base through a combination of marketing and promotional efforts 
a person becomes a registered buyer by completing an online registration process on one of our marketplaces 
as part of this process  we collect business and personal information  including name  title  company name  business address and contact information  and information on how the person intends to use our marketplaces 
each prospective buyer must also accept our terms and conditions of use 
following the completion of the online registration process  we verify each prospective buyer e mail address and confirm that the person is not listed on any banned persons list maintained internally or by the us federal government 
after the verification process  which is completed generally within hours  the registration is approved and activated and the prospective buyer is added to our registered buyer list 
total registered buyers  as of a given date  represents the aggregate number of persons or entities who have registered on one of our marketplaces 
we use this metric to evaluate how well our marketing and promotional efforts are performing 
total registered buyers excludes duplicate registrations  buyers who are suspended from utilizing our marketplaces and those buyers who have voluntarily removed themselves from our registration database 
in addition  if we become aware of registered buyers that are no longer in business  we remove them from our database 
as of september   we had approximately  registered buyers 
total auction participants 
for each auction we manage  the number of auction participants represents the total number of registered buyers who have bid one or more times in that auction 
as a result  a registered buyer who bids  or participates  in more than one auction is counted as an auction participant in each auction in which he or she participates 
thus  total auction participants for a given period is the sum of the auction participants in each auction conducted during that period 
we use this metric to allow us to compare our online auction marketplaces to our competitors  including other online auction sites and traditional on site auctioneers 
in addition  we measure total auction participants on a periodic basis to evaluate the activity level of our base of registered buyers and to measure the performance of our marketing and promotional efforts 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately  total auction participants participated in auctions on our marketplaces 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
a critical accounting estimate is one which is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and requires management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we continuously evaluate our critical accounting estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met a buyer submits the winning bid in an auction and  as a result  evidence of an arrangement exists and the sale price has been determined  the buyer has assumed risks and rewards of ownership  and collection is reasonably assured 

table of contents substantially all of our sales are recorded subsequent to payment authorization being received  utilizing credit cards  wire transfers and paypal  an internet based payment system  as methods of payments 
as a result  we are not subject to significant collection risk  as goods are generally not shipped before payment is received 
revenue is also evaluated for reporting revenue of gross proceeds as the principal in the arrangement or net of commissions as an agent 
in arrangements in which we are deemed to be the primary obligor  bear physical and general inventory risk  and credit risk  we recognize as revenue the gross proceeds from the sale  including buyer premiums 
arrangements in which we act as an agent or broker on a consignment basis  without taking general or physical inventory risk  revenue is recognized based on the sales commissions that are paid to us by the sellers for utilizing our services  in this situation  sales commissions represent a percentage of the gross proceeds from the sale that the seller pays to us upon completion of the transaction 
we have evaluated our revenue recognition policy related to sales under our profit sharing model and determined it is appropriate to account for these sales on a gross basis 
the following factors were most heavily relied upon in our determination we are the primary obligor in the arrangement  and we have general inventory risk 
we are the seller in substance and in appearance to the buyer  the buyer contacts us if there is a problem with the purchase 
only we and the buyer are parties to the sales contract and the buyer has no recourse to the supplier 
if the buyer has a problem  he or she looks to us  not the supplier 
the buyer does not and cannot look to the supplier for fulfillment or for product acceptability concerns 
we take title to the inventory upon paying the amount set forth in the contract with the supplier 
such amount is generally a percentage of the supplier original acquisition cost under our surplus and certain commercial contracts  a percentage of the supplier last retail price under certain commercial contracts and varies depending on the type of the inventory purchased or a fixed price per pound under our scrap contract 
we are at risk of loss for all amounts paid to the supplier in the event the property is damaged or otherwise becomes unsaleable 
in addition  as payments made for inventory are excluded from the calculation for the profit sharing distribution under our dod contracts  we effectively bear inventory risk for the full amount paid to acquire the property ie  there is no sharing of inventory risk 
business combinations 
we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred 
generally  restructuring costs incurred in periods subsequent to the acquisition date are expensed when incurred 
subsequent changes to the purchase price ie  working capital adjustments or other fair value adjustments determined during the measurement period are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
all subsequent changes to a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position that relate to the acquired company and existed at the acquisition date that occur both within the measurement period and as a result of facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date are recognized as an adjustment to goodwill 
all other changes in valuation allowances are recognized as a reduction or increase to income tax expense or as a direct adjustment to additional paid in capital as required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we identify and value intangible assets that we acquire in business combinations  such as customer arrangements  customer relationships and non compete agreements  that arise from contractual or other legal rights or that are capable of being 
table of contents separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is based upon an estimate of the future economic benefits expected to result from ownership  which represents the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
examples of such events or circumstances could include a significant change in business climate or a loss of significant customers 
we make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether we should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
if our evaluation indicates a likelihood of goodwill impairment  we apply a two step fair value based test to assess goodwill for impairment 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is then performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill to the fair value of the goodwill 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recorded in our statements of operations 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are also reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be realizable 
our management makes certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment  and our projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value  corroborated by comparisons to estimated market multiples 
these valuations are based on a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
we cannot predict the occurrence of certain future events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets  which totaled million at september  such events may include strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our base of buyers and sellers or material negative changes in our relationships with material customers 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred taxes based on temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities existing at each balance sheet date using enacted tax rates for the years in which the taxes are expected to be paid or recovered 
a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets to a level that we believe will more likely than not be realized 
the resulting net deferred tax asset reflects management estimate of the amount that will be realized 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we apply the authoritative guidance related to uncertainty in income taxes 
we concluded that there were no uncertain tax positions identified during our analysis 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we recognize in the statements of operations all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their estimated fair values 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair values of share based payments 
the above list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting estimates 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with little need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited financial statements and related notes  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
components of revenue and expenses revenue

after deducting allowable operating expenses  we disburse to the dod on a monthly basis a percentage of the profits of the aggregate monthly sales 
we retain the remaining percentage of these profits after the dod disbursement 
we refer to these disbursement payments to the dod as profit sharing distributions 
technology and operations 
technology expenses consist primarily of personnel costs related to our programming staff who develop and deploy new marketplaces and continuously enhance existing marketplaces 
these personnel also develop and upgrade the software systems that support our operations  such as sales processing 
because our marketplaces and support systems require frequent upgrades and enhancements to maintain viability  we have determined that the useful life for substantially all of our internally developed software is less than one year 
as a result  we expense these costs as incurred

capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures consist primarily of computers and purchased software  office equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
the timing and volume of such capital expenditures in the future will be affected by the addition of new customers or expansion of existing customer relationships 
we expect capital expenditures to range from million to million in the fiscal year ending september  we intend to fund those expenditures primarily from operating cash flows 
our capital expenditures for the year ended september  were million 
as of september   we have no outstanding commitments for capital expenditures 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the development and deployment of new marketplaces  the introduction of new value added services and the costs to establish additional distribution centers 
although we are currently not a party to any definitive agreement with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt securities would result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional debt would result in increased interest expense and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
there is no assurance that such financing  if required  will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all

we do not believe that inflation had any material effect on our results of operations during the fiscal years ended september   and new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  which amends existing guidance by requiring that additional information be disclosed about items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the additional information includes separately stating the total change for each component of other comprehensive income and separately disclosing both current period other comprehensive income and reclassification adjustments 
entities are also required to present  either on the face of the income statement or in the note to the financial statements  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income as separate line items of net income but only if the entire amount reclassified must be reclassified to net income in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity must cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional detail about those amounts 
asu will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   which for the company will be our fiscal first quarter 
the company does not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb amended its guidance for testing goodwill for impairment by allowing an entity to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment 
the amended guidance  included in asu  testing goodwill for impairment is effective for our annual reporting period beginning on october  the amended guidance is intended to reduce complexity and costs by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit 
the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity 
we had million of fixed unsecured subordinated debt as of september   which we repaid in fiscal year  and thus do not have any related interest rate exposure

the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income consistent with minimizing risk of material loss 
exchange rate sensitivity 
we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal  as less than ten percent of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we have not engaged in any hedging or other derivative transactions to date
