overview our clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine in the following indications acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  in the elderly  myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  and non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have other ongoing clinical programs with sapacitabine in non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc and sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib in patients who are brca mutation carriers awaiting further data 
once data becomes available and is reviewed  we will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and or partnering these assets and also seliciclib in nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancer  or npc 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we have generated several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk  inhibitors plk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trial in aml and in phase for mds and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
our resources are primarily directed towards advancing our lead drug candidate sapacitabine through in house development activities 
we are advancing our earlier stage novel drug series through a combination of government funding and external collaborators but with limited investment by us 
research and development expenditures for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine and seliciclib and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with a research facility located in dundee  scotland 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre clinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses are comprised of research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  registered direct financings  licensing revenue  collaborations  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have recognized revenues from inception through december   totaling million  of which million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements and million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards 
we also recorded million from product sales  although these sales ceased effective september  we have also recognized million in research and development tax credits  which are reported as income tax benefits on the consolidated statements of operations  from the united kingdom s tax authority  hm revenue customs since inception 
recent events grant award in november  we were awarded a grant of approximately million from the uk government s biomedical catalyst to complete an investigational new drug ind directed preclinical development of cyc  a novel orally available  second generation  cdk inhibitor 
reverse stock split on august   we effected a for reverse stock split of shares of common stock in order to increase the per share trading price of our shares of common stock to satisfy the minimum bid requirement for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
we received notification from nasdaq that as of september   we evidenced a closing bid of our common stock price in excess of the minimum requirement for at least consecutive trading days 
accordingly  we have regained compliance with listing rule a 
all share and per share information presented gives effect to the reverse stock split  which occurred on august  termination and settlement agreement on august   we entered into an agreement with sinclair pharmaceuticals limited sinclair to terminate  effective september   the distribution agreements relating to the promotion and sale of xclair  numoisyn lozenges and numoisyn liquid 
the agreement includes a minimum royalty arrangement based on future net revenues  under which sinclair will pay us a minimum of approximately million in quarterly installments over the next three years ending on september  the operating results associated with the promotion and sale of xclair  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges are classified within loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented  and the associated assets and liabilities are classified within current and long term assets of discontinued operations and current liabilities of discontinued operations  as appropriate  in the consolidated balance sheets for all applicable periods presented 

table of contents preferred stock dividend on january   the board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share on our convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock 
the cash dividend was paid on february  to the holders of record of the preferred stock as of the close business on january  preferred stock exchange on january  february and march   we settled three separate securities exchange agreements with preferred stockholders  pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of  common shares to preferred stock holders in exchange of  shares of our exchangeable convertible preferred stock 
the terms were determined by arms length negotiations between the parties and the shares of common stock were issued in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  for securities exchanged by the issuer and an existing security holder where no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly by the issuer for soliciting such exchange 
as we issued  common shares in excess of the number of shares the preferred stock was convertible into under the original conversion terms  we anticipate recording approximately million of deemed dividends associated with these exchanges during the first quarter of as of march   a total of  shares of preferred stock remain outstanding

results of continuing operations revenues the following table summarizes the components of our revenues for the years ended december   and all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to collaboration and research and development revenue grant revenue total revenue we recognized million of collaboration and research and development revenue for the year ended december   derived from an agreement with a pharmaceutical company under which we provided one of our compounds for evaluation in the field of eye care 
we had no collaboration and research and development revenue for the years ended december  and grant revenue is recognized as we incur and pay for qualifying costs and services under the applicable grant 
grant revenue is primarily derived from various united kingdom government and european union grant awards 
for the years ended december  and  we had grant revenue of  and  respectively 
we did not recognize any grant revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents the future we expect to recognize approximately million in grant revenue over the next twelve to eighteen months from the european union and approximately million in grant revenue over the next two years from the uk government s biomedical catalyst 
research and development expenses from our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents and our research and development expenses have represented costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including clinical trial costs for sapacitabine  seliciclib  and sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib 
we have also incurred costs in the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and pre clinical trials and the development of in house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial and regulatory related costs  payroll and personnel related expenses  including consultants and contract research  preclinical studies and laboratory supplies and materials  technology license costs  and rent and facility expenses for our laboratories 
the following table provides information with respect to our research and development expenditures for the years ended december   and all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to sapacitabine other costs related to research and development programs  management and exploratory research total research and development expenses research and development expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in research and development expenses is stock based compensation of million  million and approximately  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenditures decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to million of contractual expenses recognized during the year ended december   resulting from an achievement of a milestone triggered by the opening of enrollment in the lead in portion our seamless trial  pursuant to the daiichi sankyo license under which we license certain patent rights for sapacitabine  a million decrease in outsourced research costs as a result of an out of period reversal of accrued pre clinical costs  a million decrease in sapacitabine clinical supply costs  a million decrease in stock compensation charges  and a million decrease in employment costs partially offset by a million increase in clinical trial costs 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs increased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs of million is primarily due to a million increase in sapacitabine related costs and a million decrease in other research and development costs  respectively  as we continue to focus on the development of sapacitabine 
the million increase in sapacitabine expenditures was primarily due to million of contractual expenses  resulting from an achievement of a milestone triggered by the opening of enrollment in our seamless trial  pursuant to the daiichi sankyo license under which we license certain patent rights for sapacitabine  a million increase related to clinical trial supplies  and a million increase in clinical trial expenses 
other research and development costs decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   as we have concentrated financial resources on the development of sapacitabine and reduced investment in other compounds 
the future we expect to continue to concentrate our resources on the development of sapacitabine 
we anticipate that overall research and development expenditures  for the year ended december  to be similar compared to the year ended december   as we continue enrollment in the randomized portion of the seamless pivotal phase trial 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the total general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to general and administrative expenses total general and administrative expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal our general and administrative expenditure increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to a net increase in professional and consultancy costs of million  an increase of employment related costs of million  and offset by a decrease in stock compensation costs of million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in professional and consultancy costs of million  a decrease in stock based compensation of million  a decrease in salaries of million  and a decrease in rent of million as a result of the expiration of our lease on a facility in bothell  washington in december these amounts were partially offset by a million increase in patent related costs  and a million increase in board of directors expenses  mostly due to the addition of two new board members during the year ended december  the future we expect general and administrative expenditures for the year ended december  to be lower than our expenditures for the year ended december  as a result of an expected decrease in professional and consultancy costs 
other income expense the following table summarizes the other income for years ended december   and all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to non cash consideration associated with stock purchase agreement change in valuation of economic rights change in valuation of liabilities measured at fair value foreign exchange losses gains interest income interest expense other income total other expense  income net 
table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income and expense  net  decreased by approximately million  from income of approximately million for year ended december   to an expense of approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily because of a million decrease in change in valuation of liabilities measured at fair value and a expense related to the stock purchase agreement  partially offset by a million increase in foreign exchange gains losses  mostly due to the increase in exchange rate of the british pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
non cash consideration associated with stock purchase agreement the million represents the portion of the fair value of the  shares of common stock issued for no consideration in the connection with the aspire transaction that have been allocated to the right to sell additional shares in the future 
change in valuation of economic rights this relates to the sale of economic rights in connection with our ongoing litigation with celgene corporation pursuant to the purchase agreement completed with certain investors in march these collective rights are classified as liabilities and are marked to market each reporting period 
for the year ended december   we recognized a loss of approximately  due to the change in the value of economic rights from the transaction date of march  to december  change in valuation of liabilities measured at fair value the change in valuation of other liabilities measured at fair value relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february and our liability under an agreement with the scottish enterprise  or se  that would potentially require us to make a payment to se should staffing levels in scotland fall below prescribed minimum levels 
the warrants and agreement are classified as liabilities 
the value of the warrants and the se agreement are being marked to market each reporting period as a gain or loss 
such gains or losses will continue to be reported for the warrants until they are exercised or expired 
gains or losses on the se agreement will be reported until the agreement expires in july for the year ended december  and  the change in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value was a gain of million and a gain of approximately  respectively 
foreign exchange gains losses foreign exchange gains losses increased by million to a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss of approximately million for the year ended december  foreign exchange gains losses are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as a separate line item within other income expense 
the intercompany loans outstanding are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the nature of the funding advanced is of a long term investment nature 
therefore all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements related to intercompany loans recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million gain and million loss for the years ended december  and december   respectively 

table of contents interest income interest income decreased by approximately  to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  for the year ended december  the lower interest income was due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents in as compared to other income we recognized  in other income from the sale of laboratory equipment during the year ended december  we did not recognize any such income during the year ended december  fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income expense  net  increased by million  from an expense of million for the year ended december   to income of million for the year ended december   mainly due the million increase in the change in the valuation of the warrant liability  mostly due to the decrease in our common share price from at december  to at december  change in valuation of liabilities measured at fair value the change in valuation of other liabilities measured at fair value relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february and our liability under an agreement with the scottish enterprise  or se  that would potentially require us to make a payment to se should staffing levels in scotland fall below prescribed minimum levels 
the warrants and agreement are classified as liabilities 
the value of the warrants and the se agreement are being marked to market each reporting period as a gain or loss 
such gains or losses will continue to be reported for the warrants until they are exercised or expired 
gains or losses on the se agreement will be reported until the agreement expires in july for the year ended december   we recognized income from the change in the valuation of liabilities measured at fair value of million and for the year ended december   we recognized an expense of million 
foreign exchange gain loss foreign exchange gains losses not related to intercompany loans are recorded in income expense 
foreign exchange gain loss was a  expense for the year ended december   compared to a  expense for the year ended december  the intercompany loans outstanding are not expected to be repaid in the foreseeable future and the nature of the funding advanced is of a long term investment nature 
therefore all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements related to intercompany loans recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income interest income increased by  from  for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december  this is mostly attributed to a higher average daily balance of cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  
table of contents interest expense interest expense was  for year ended december  we did not record any interest expense for the year ended december  this reduction was due to the elimination of the accretion expense associated with the restructured bothell lease  which expired in december the future the valuation of the economic rights  warrants liability  and se agreement will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the change in valuation of the economic rights is dependent on a number factors  including our stock price  and other management assumptions  including the probability of success of the underlying litigation  amount of award or settlement  discount rate  royalty rate  and timing of cash flows  and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
the valuation of the warrants is not expected to change based on the exercise price relative to the market price per share of our common stock and the february expiration 
the valuation of the se agreement is dependent on a number of factors  including our stock price and the probability of the occurrence of certain events that would give rise to a payment 
we do not expect the valuation of fair value of the se agreement to fluctuate significantly 
the value of the purchased put right obtained in connection with the aspire stock purchase agreement is not expected to change throughout the term of the agreement because shares sold upon exercise are priced at a an amount slightly lower than the current fair value at the time of sale 
as the nature of funding advanced through intercompany loans is that of a long term investment in nature  unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred 
the following table summarizes total income tax benefit for the years ended december   and all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to total income tax benefit fiscal as compared to fiscal the total income tax benefit increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development tax credits recoverable increased by approximately million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year 
in  these credits were also restricted to the payroll taxes paid by us to the uk tax authority in that year 
however  in july  legislation was passed to eliminate this restriction for the year ended december  in addition  the income tax benefit for the year ended december  includes a million income tax benefit that is completely offset by a million income tax expense related to discontinued operations 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable was linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but was also restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease is a consequence of the lower eligible payroll expenses in the united kingdom 
the future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future and will elect to do so 
the amount of tax credits we will receive is entirely dependent on the amount of eligible expenses we incur 
we expect our qualifying research and development expenditure  and thus our tax credit  will remain the same or increase for the year ended december  
table of contents results of discontinued operations loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax all numbers in table are in thousands except percentages years ended differences differences to to to to loss from discontinued operations gain on termination of distribution agreement income tax expense loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax in august  we entered into a termination and settlement agreement with sinclair to terminate  effective september   our license to distribute the align products  after which we will no longer generate product revenue 
the operating results associated with the align products are classified within income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and fiscal as compared to fiscal loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million from a loss of million for the year ended december   to income of million for the year ended december  the increase is the result of a million gain on termination of the distribution agreements  which is the million for the present value of the million we will receive over the next three years as part of a minimum royalty arrangement included in our termination agreement with sinclair and the recognition of million associated with a million product returns provision liability for which an offsetting asset has been recorded based on our rights under the termination and settlement agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million and product revenue decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in addition  we recorded income tax expense associated with discontinued operations for the year ended december  of million  which is offset by a million income tax benefit recorded in continuing operations for the year ended december  fiscal as compared to fiscal loss from discontinued operations  net of tax decreased million from a loss of million for the year ended december   to a loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses a million increase in product revenues and a million decrease in cost of sales 
the future we have ceased operations associated with the align products effective september  and do not expect significant activity beyond the year ended december  we may earn additional income from discontinued operations over the next three years if certain sales targets are met by a successor distributor according to the termination agreement with sinclair 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the following is a summary of our key liquidity measures as of december   and december december december in thousands cash and cash equivalents working capital current assets current liabilities total working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in balance was primarily due to normal cash outflows required to operate our business  offset by million in proceeds  net of certain expenses  received from a sale of common stock and economic rights completed in march and approximately million in proceeds received from a stock purchase agreement completed in december at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to normal cash outflows required to operate our business  offset by net proceeds of million from the july underwritten common stock offering 
current liabilities were million at december  and million at december  the million increase from december  to december  was primarily due to the million economic rights liability recorded as the result of a financing agreement entered into in march and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities driven by an increase in professional and consultancy costs 
between december  and  accounts payable  accrued and other current liabilities increased million  offset by a million decrease in warrants and other derivatives 
since our inception  we have generated a limited amount of product revenues from align product sales  which are presented within loss from discontinued operations  net 
the align product revenues ceased on september  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of common and preferred equity securities  as well as the exercise of warrants  to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from operations and recent financing activities are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
however  we do not currently have sufficient funds to complete development and commercialization of any of our drug candidates 
current business and capital market risks could have a detrimental effect on the availability of sources of funding and our ability to access them in the future which may delay or impede our progress of advancing our drugs currently in the clinical pipeline to approval by the fda for commercialization 

table of contents cash flows cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for the years ended december   and is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities cash flows generated from discontinued operations have been combined with the cash flows from continuing operations within each of the operating  investing and financing activities sections 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities decreased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from our net loss of million  adjusted for million of material non cash activities comprising of change in valuation of liability classified warrants  non cash consideration associated with stock purchase agreement  depreciation  unrealized foreign exchange losses  stock based compensation expense amounting  transaction costs on sale of economic rights and gain on termination of distribution agreements and a net increase of million due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a net increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities decreased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from our net loss of million  adjusted for material non cash activities comprising of change in valuation of liability classified warrants  depreciation  unrealized foreign exchange losses and stock based compensation expense amounting to million and a net increase of million due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a net increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
investing activities net cash used in provided by investing activities increased from approximately  used in investing activities for the year ended december  to approximately  provided by investing activities for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the sale of laboratory equipment 
net cash provided by used in investing activities decreased  from and inflow of  for the year ended december  to an outflow of  for the year ended december  capital expenditures have remained low as the company has continued to focus on the clinical development of sapacitabine 
capital expenditures were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as a result of approximately million proceeds  net of certain expenses  from the sale of stock and economic rights and million in proceeds related to a stock purchase agreement entered into in december net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  mostly from million in financing proceeds  net of certain expenses  and offset by the payment of a million dividend to the holders of our preferred stock 
for the year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities was lower than in the previous year primarily due to the completion of a private placement of million in net proceeds during october  the two registered direct offerings in january for net proceeds of million  the issuance of million shares of common stock for million as part of the committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge and the exercise of options and warrants totaling million during  as compared to the completion of an underwritten offering in july for net proceeds of million and payment of a preferred stock dividend of million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future and cannot guarantee that we will generate any significant product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we have generated a limited amount of product revenues from align product sales but these product revenues ceased on september  however  we will receive approximately million in quarterly installments over the next three years as part of a minimum royalty arrangement included in our termination agreement with sinclair  which will be reported as cash flows provided by used in investing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and 
table of contents the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks  the current economic climate has also impacted the availability of funds and activity in equity markets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan 
in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
clinical trial accounting data management and monitoring of our clinical trials are performed with the assistance of contract research organizations cros or clinical research associates cras in accordance with our standard operating procedures 
typically  cros and some cras bill monthly for services performed  and others bill based upon milestones achieved 
for outstanding amounts  we accrue unbilled clinical trial expenses based on estimates of the level of services performed each period 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in the trials are expensed immediately as research and development expenses 
clinical trial costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered into and progress through the trial 
any initial payment made to the clinical trial site is recognized upon execution of the clinical trial agreements and expensed as research and development expenses 
research and development expenditures research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our product candidates  upfront fees  milestones  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and development materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs and depreciation 
expenditures relating to research and development are expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation we grant stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to officers  employees  directors and consultants under the company s amended and restated equity incentive plan  which was amended and restated as of april  and may  we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of grant date fair value for stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 

table of contents the fair value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
economic rights the economic rights are accounted for as a derivative financial instrument and measured at fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
the fair value of the economic rights has been estimated using a decision tree analysis method 
this is an income based method that incorporates the expected benefits  costs and probabilities of contingent outcomes under varying scenarios 
each scenario within the decision tree is discounted to the present value using the company s credit adjusted risk free rate and ascribed a weighted probability to determine the fair value 
changes in any of these assumptions could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the economic rights 
the company has concluded the fair value of this liability was approximately million as of december  we recognized a loss of approximately  on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as a result of change in value of the economic rights 
other liabilities measured at fair value warrants liability the accounting guidance on derivatives and hedging requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as equity instruments  assets or liabilities 
under the provisions of this guidance  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
since we are unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares  the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded income of approximately million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively to reflect the change in fair value 
fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
we do not expect changes in any of these variables to result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrants liability
