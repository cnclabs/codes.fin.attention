item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in millions  except per share data and unless otherwise indicated executive overview united rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world 
our customer service network consists of rental locations in the united states and canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities 
although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse  we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because  as a larger company  we have more extensive resources and certain compelling competitive advantages 
these include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost oec  based on the initial consideration paid  of billion  and a national branch network that operates in us states and every canadian province  and serves of the largest metropolitan areas in the united states 
in addition  our size gives us greater purchasing power  the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services  the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well maintained and therefore more productive and reliable  and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs 
we offer approximately  classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities  homeowners and government entities 
our revenues are derived from the following sources equipment rentals  sales of rental equipment  sales of new equipment  contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues 
in  equipment rental revenues represented percent of our total revenues 
for the past several years  we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion 
to achieve this objective  we have developed a strategy focused on customer service differentiation  customer segmentation  rate management  fleet management and disciplined cost control 
this strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers  often provided through a single point of contact  an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts  a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets  and the profitable deployment of our rental assets for optimal return on investment 
on april   we acquired percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest the acquisition of rsc holdings inc rsc 
the results of rsc operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
rsc  which had total revenues of billion in  was one of the largest equipment rental providers in north america  and as of december  had a network of rental locations in us states and three canadian provinces 
the acquisition has created a leading north american equipment rental company with a more attractive business mix  greater scale and enhanced growth prospects  and we believe that the acquisition will provide us with financial benefits including reduced operating expenses and additional revenue opportunities going forward 
since the acquisition date  significant amounts of fleet have been moved between united rentals locations and the acquired rsc locations  and it is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amounts of revenue and earnings of rsc since the acquisition date 
the impact of the rsc acquisition on our equipment rentals revenue is primarily reflected in the percent increase in the volume of oec on rent in for additional information concerning the rsc acquisition  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  we adopted the american rental association criteria for rental rates  time utilization and oec  comparisons to prior years are based on a recast of these metrics on the same basis 
although uncertainty in the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our company and the north american equipment rental industry in  we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy 
for the full year  compared with  these achievements included a percent increase in rental rates on a pro forma basis that is  assuming united rentals and rsc were combined for full year and 
rental rate changes for are only available on a pro forma basis  a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent  which significantly benefited from the impact of the rsc acquisition  achieved strong time utilization on a significantly larger fleet 
time utilization was percent and percent for the years ended december  and  respectively  a significant increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from national account customers  from percent in to percent in is only available on a pro forma basis 
national accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least  or customers doing business in multiple locations  continued improvement in customer service management  including a significant increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from accounts that are managed by a single point of contact key accounts from percent in to percent in is only available on a pro forma basis 
establishing a single 
table of contents point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory  the continued optimization of our network of rental locations  including an increase in of  or percent  in the number of rental locations in our trench safety  power and hvac segment  and a percentage point improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
in  we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process  enhanced customer service capabilities  and sustained cost efficiencies 
in particular  we will focus on enhancing our value proposition by improving customer service levels  further increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from national accounts and other large customers 
to the extent that we are successful  we believe that we can improve our equipment rental gross margin and overall profitability over time  as large accounts tend to rent more equipment for longer periods and can be serviced more cost effectively than short term transactional customers  accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace  where we believe that our depth of resources  industrial expertise and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage 
additionally  industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand  making our aggregate end markets less volatile  further capitalizing on the demand for the higher margin power and climate control equipment offered by our trench safety  power and hvac segment  leveraging technology and training to optimize the transportation of our rental equipment to and from customer jobsites  and maximizing equipment utilization by reducing the average number of equipment units unavailable for rent and the average time a unit is unavailable for rent 
in  based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators  we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover 
specifically  in  we expect that the us equipment rental industry will achieve year over year revenue growth in the mid to high single digits 
financial overview despite the challenges posed by recent economic and credit market conditions  and as discussed elsewhere in this report  we succeeded in taking a number of positive actions in and related to our capital structure  and have significantly improved our financial flexibility and liquidity 
these actions  which are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  include in march  in connection with the rsc acquisition  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior secured notes due  aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due and  aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in march  we increased the size of the abl facility from billion to billion 
in september  we amended our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the amended facility expires on september   includes an increase in the facility size from to  and may be extended on a day basis by mutual agreement of the company and the purchasers under the facility 
in october  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in october  we redeemed our percent senior notes 
in december  all of our outstanding percent convertible senior subordinated notes were converted 
these actions have improved our financial flexibility and liquidity and positioned us to invest the necessary capital in our business to take advantage of opportunities in the economic recovery

these items are excluded from adjusted ebitda internally when evaluating our operating performance and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time  as well as with those of other similar companies 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda  when viewed with the company s results under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and the accompanying reconciliation  provide useful information about operating performance and period over period growth  and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions 
additionally  management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda permit investors to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings  from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced 
however  ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and  accordingly  should not be considered as alternatives to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity

revenues 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows year ended december  percent change equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenues equipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment  as well as related revenues such as the fees we charge for equipment delivery  fuel  repair or maintenance of rental equipment and damage waivers 
sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment 
sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment 
contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors  which include construction consumables  tools  small equipment and safety supplies 
services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services including parts sales 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase reflects a percent increase in equipment rentals  which was primarily due to a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent  and a percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis  partially offset by changes in rental mix 
there are two components of rental mix that impact equipment rentals the type of equipment rented and the duration of the rental contract daily  weekly and monthly 
in  we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts  which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent  but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs 
we believe that the rate and volume improvements for reflect  in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition  a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment 
as discussed above  we acquired rsc on april   and the results of rsc operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date 
the impact of the rsc acquisition on equipment rentals is primarily reflected in the increase in the volume of oec on rent 
rental rate changes are calculated based on the year over year variance in average contract rates  weighted by the prior period revenue mix 
additionally  sales of rental equipment increased percent  primarily reflecting increased volume and improved pricing in a stronger retail market and the impact of the rsc acquisition 
total revenues of billion increased percent compared with total revenues of billion in the increase primarily reflects a percent increase in equipment rentals  which was primarily due to a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a percent rental rate increase  and a percent increase in sales of rental equipment  which was primarily due to increased volume  improved pricing and changes in the mix of equipment sold 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in applying many accounting principles  we make assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
these assumptions  estimates and or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis 
material changes in these assumptions  estimates and or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions  estimates and or judgments 
although actual results may differ from those estimates  we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate 
revenue recognition 
we recognize equipment rental revenue on a straight line basis 
our rental contract periods are hourly  daily  weekly or monthly 
by way of example  if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily  weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were in actual dollars  and  respectively  we would recognize revenue of per day 
the daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of by the 
table of contents monthly term of days 
as part of this straight line methodology  when the equipment is returned  we recognize as incremental revenue the excess  if any  between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
in any given accounting period  we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date 
for instance  continuing the above example  if the above customer rented a piece of equipment on december and returned it at the close of business on january  we would recognize incremental revenue on january of in actual dollars  representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straight line basis 
we record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
we had deferred revenue of and as of december  and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of rental equipment and new equipment are recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales of contractor supplies are also recognized at the time of delivery to  or pick up by  the customer 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
these allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write off experience 
our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances  including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances 
trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes 
write offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds 
useful lives and salvage values of rental equipment and property and equipment 
we depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives  after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to percent of cost 
rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent 
costs we incur in connection with refurbishment programs that extend the life of our equipment are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the equipment 
the costs incurred under these refurbishment programs were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  and are included in purchases of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenues  such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness 
in addition  the salvage value  which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness  is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period 
we may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances 
if these estimates change in the future  we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
similarly  to the extent the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point  we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset 
to the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year  we estimate that our annual non rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately or  respectively 
purchase price allocation 
we have made a number of acquisitions in the past including the acquisition of rsc in and may continue to make acquisitions in the future 
we allocate the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
long lived assets principally rental equipment and goodwill generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions 
in addition to goodwill  the intangible assets that we have acquired are non compete agreements  customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks 
goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed 
non compete agreements  customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows 
when we make an acquisition  we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities 
these other assets and liabilities typically include  but are not limited to  parts inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable and other working capital items 
because of their short term nature  the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities balance sheets 
evaluation of goodwill impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires 
table of contents judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant either a taxable or nontaxable transaction 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units which are our regions using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions within our industry including our own acquisitions 
we believe this approach  which utilizes multiple valuation techniques  yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value 
we review goodwill for impairment utilizing a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units net assets to the respective carrying value of net assets 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit net assets is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit net assets is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step must be performed 
in the second step  the impairment is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill as if purchase accounting were performed on the testing date with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment loss must be recognized for the excess and charged to operations 
inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results  business plans  expected growth rates  cost of capital and tax rates 
we also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions  interest rates and other market data 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods 
changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit  and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment 
the following assumptions are significant to our income approach business projections we make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels 
these assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections 
these projections are developed using our internal business plans over a ten year planning period that are updated at least annually  long term growth rates beyond the planning period  we also utilize an assumed long term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit earnings stream is projected to grow 
these rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units  and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten year planning period  and discount rates our combined future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants 
the weighted average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise 
the market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
this approach takes two forms the first is based on the market value market capitalization plus interest bearing liabilities and operating metrics eg  revenue and ebitda of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business 
the second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies within our industry  including our own acquisitions 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment 
this guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
we early adopted this guidance and  in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october   we concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than their carrying amounts 
after reaching this conclusion  no further testing was performed 
the qualitative factors we considered included  but were not limited to  general economic conditions  our outlook for construction activity  our recent and forecasted financial performance and the price of the company common stock 
in connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of october   we bypassed the qualitative assessment for each of our reporting units and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test 
as of october  our annual goodwill impairment testing date  we had billion of goodwill on our balance sheet  of which billion arose from the rsc acquisition 
our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying values by at least percent 
in connection with this impairment testing  we generally utilized a discount rate of percent and a long term terminal growth rate of percent beyond our planning period 
we also performed sensitivity analyses related to the discount rate and long term growth rate 
specifically  we stress tested our results under the following three scenarios i increasing the discount rate by basis points  ii reducing the long term growth rate to percent  and iii increasing the discount rate by basis points and reducing the 
table of contents long term growth rate to percent 
in each of these three scenarios  the fair values still exceeded the carrying values for each reporting unit 
impairment of long lived assets excluding goodwill 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets  including rental equipment and property and equipment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized asset impairment charges of  and  respectively  in our general rentals segment 
the impairment charges primarily represent write offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets which were recognized in connection with the restructuring activity discussed below  and are primarily reflected in non rental depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as of december  and  there were no held for sale assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to the impairment reviews we conduct in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in the business  each quarter we conduct a review of rental assets with utilization below a specified threshold 
we select these assets  which represented approximately four percent of our total rental assets at december   as we believe they are at the greatest risk of potential impairment 
as part of this impairment review  we estimate future rental revenues based on current and expected utilization levels  the age of these assets and their remaining useful lives 
additionally  we estimate when the asset is expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition 
based on our most recently completed december  quarterly review  there was no impairment associated with these assets 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized 
in the case of deferred tax assets  the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and tax planning strategies 
after consideration of all these factors  we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them 
the most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets 
we use a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters 
our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results 
reserves for claims 
we are exposed to various claims relating to our business  including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self insured retentions  which we sometimes refer to as self insurance 
these claims include i workers compensation claims and ii claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment or personnel 
these types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and  accordingly  the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time 
our methodology for developing self insurance reserves is based on management estimates  which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations 
our estimation process considers  among other matters  the cost of known claims over time  cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims 
these estimates may change based on  among other things  changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims 
further  these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts 
accordingly  we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels 
as discussed below  during the fourth quarters of  and  we recognized a benefit of  a benefit of and a charge of  respectively  related to our provision for self insurance reserves 

table of contents legal contingencies 
we are involved in a variety of claims  lawsuits  investigations and proceedings  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this report 
we determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information 
we develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters  which involves an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual  or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination  judgment or settlement occurs 
results of operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our reportable segments are general rentals and trench safety  power and hvac 
the general rentals segment includes the rental of construction  aerial and industrial equipment  general tools and light equipment  and related services and activities 
the general rentals segment s customers include construction and industrial companies  manufacturers  utilities  municipalities and homeowners 
the general rentals segment operates throughout the united states and canada 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services 
the trench safety  power and hvac segment s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects  municipalities and industrial companies 
this segment operates throughout the united states and in canada 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we aggregate our geographic regions eastern canada  gulf south  industrial which serves the geographic gulf region and has a strong industrial presence  mid atlantic  mid central  midwest  mountain west  northeast  northwest  south  southeast and southwest into our general rentals reporting segment 
historically  there have been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these regions 
for instance  for the five year period ended december   certain of our regions had equipment rentals gross margins that varied by between percent and percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
for the year ended december   the aggregate general rentals equipment rentals gross margin increased percentage points to percent  primarily reflecting increased rental rates  a percentage point increase in time utilization on a significantly larger fleet  and cost improvements 
as compared to the equipment rentals revenue increase of percent  i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased percent due primarily to higher rental volume  ii compensation costs increased percent due primarily to increased headcount associated with higher rental volume and the rsc acquisition and iii building and property costs increased percent due primarily to the impact of the rsc acquisition 
our equipment rental revenue increased more than our costs because rates which were a significant driver of the year over year revenue improvement result in fewer variable costs compared to utilization 
for the five year period ended december   the general rentals region with the lowest equipment rentals gross margin was the southeast 
the southeast region equipment rentals gross margin of percent for the five year period ended december  was percent less than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
the southeast region equipment rentals gross margin was less than the other general rentals regions during this period as it experienced more significant declines in its end markets than the other regions  which led to more competitive pricing pressure and lower fleet investment 
for the year ended december   the southeast region equipment rentals gross margin increased percentage points to percent  primarily reflecting a percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis and cost improvements  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in time utilization 
as compared to equipment rentals revenue  which increased percent  i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased percent due primarily to higher rental volume  ii compensation costs increased percent and iii building and property costs increased percent 
for the five year period ended december   the general rentals region with the highest equipment rentals gross margin was the south 
the south region equipment rentals gross margin of percent for the five year period ended december  was percent more than the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals regions over the same period 
the south region equipment rentals gross margin was more than the other general rentals regions during this period as its end markets grew faster than the other regions  which resulted in stronger pricing 
for the year ended december   the south region equipment rentals gross margin increased percentage points to percent  primarily reflecting a percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis and cost improvements  partially offset by a percentage point decrease in time utilization 
as compared to equipment rentals revenue  which increased percent  including the impact of the rsc acquisition  i aggregate repairs and maintenance and delivery costs increased percent due primarily to higher rental volume  ii compensation costs increased percent and iii building and property costs increased percent 

table of contents although the margins for certain of our general rentals regions exceeded a percent variance level for the five year period ended december   we expect convergence going forward given the cyclical nature of the construction industry  which impacts each region differently  and our continued focus on cost cutting  improved processes and fleet sharing 
additionally  the margins for the five year period ended december  include the significant impact of the economic downturn in that impacted all our regions 
for the year ended december   the largest variance from the aggregated general rentals regions margin was percent as compared to percent for the five year period ended december  although we believe aggregating these regions into our general rentals reporting segment for segment reporting purposes is appropriate  to the extent that the margin variances persist and the equipment rentals gross margins do not converge  we may be required to disaggregate the regions into separate reporting segments 
any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations 
these segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources 
we evaluate segment performance based on segment equipment rentals gross profit 
our revenues  operating results  and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers  with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter 
revenues by segment were as follows general rentals trench safety  power and hvac total year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue year ended december  equipment rentals sales of rental equipment sales of new equipment contractor supplies sales service and other revenues total revenue equipment rentals 
equipment rentals of billion increased billion  or percent  as compared to  primarily reflecting a percent increase in the volume of oec on rent and a percent rental rate increase on a pro forma basis  partially offset by changes in rental mix 
in  we increased the proportion of equipment rentals generated from monthly rental contracts  which results in equipment rentals increasing at a lesser rate than the volume of oec on rent  but produces higher margins as there are less transaction costs 
we believe that the rate and volume improvements for reflect  in addition to the impact of the rsc acquisition  a modest improvement in our operating environment and a shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment 
as discussed above  we acquired rsc on april   and the results of rsc operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date

liquidity and capital resources 
we manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices  which are subject to i the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services  ii the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and iii the statutes  regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate 
during  we took a number of actions related to our capital structure to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity 
these actions  which are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  include in march  in connection with the rsc acquisition  we issued aggregate principal amount of percent senior secured notes due  aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due and  aggregate principal amount of percent senior notes due in march  the size of the abl facility was increased from billion to billion

total debt at december  increased by  or percent  as compared to december   primarily due to additional borrowings and debt assumed in connection with the rsc acquisition 
short term debt at december  primarily reflects of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility and of percent convertible senior notes 
the percent convertible senior notes mature in  but are reflected as short term debt because they were redeemable at december  our principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment and borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility

the maximum amounts outstanding under the abl facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility exceeded the average amounts outstanding during the year primarily due to additional borrowings following the rsc acquisition 
we expect that our principal needs for cash relating to our operations over the next months will be to fund i operating activities and working capital  ii the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale  iii payments due under operating leases  iv debt service  and v acquisitions 
we plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash 
in addition  we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate  the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit 
for information on the scheduled principal and interest payments coming due on our outstanding debt and on the payments coming due under our existing operating leases  see certain information concerning contractual obligations 
to access the capital markets  we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets 
credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions  including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions 
as a result  negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding 
our credit ratings as of january  were as follows corporate rating outlook moody s b stable standard poor s b stable a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
there is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future 
the amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors  including general economic conditions and growth prospects 
we expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations  proceeds from the sale of rental and non rental equipment and  if required  borrowings available under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility 
our gross and net rental capital expenditures increased significantly in relative to net rental 
table of contents capital expenditures defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment were and in and  respectively 
we expect our gross and net rental capital expenditures to increase significantly in relative to we expect net rental capital expenditures of approximately billion and gross rental purchases of approximately billion in loan covenants and compliance 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the abl facility  the accounts receivable securitization facility  the senior notes and the quips 
any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in october  we amended our abl facility 
the only material financial covenants which currently exist relate to the fixed charge coverage ratio and the senior secured leverage ratio under the abl facility 
subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the abl facility  these covenants will only apply in the future if availability under the abl facility falls below the greater of percent of the maximum revolver amount under the amended abl facility and since the october amendment of the facility and through december   availability under the facility has exceeded the required threshold and  as a result  these maintenance covenants have been inapplicable 
under our accounts receivable securitization facility  we are required  among other things  to maintain certain financial tests relating to i the default ratio  ii the delinquency ratio  iii the dilution ratio and iv days sales outstanding 
as of december   urna had limited restricted payment capacity under the most restrictive restricted payment covenants in the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness 
although this limited capacity restricts our ability to move operating cash flows to holdings  because of certain intercompany arrangements  we do not expect any material adverse impact on holdings ability to meet its cash obligations 
sources and uses of cash 
during  we i generated cash from operating activities of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received cash from debt proceeds  net of payments  of  including  of proceeds from debt issuances associated with the rsc acquisition  a portion of which was used to repay certain of rsc senior debt 
we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of  ii purchase other companies for  including cash paid for the rsc acquisition  iii purchase shares of our common stock for and iv pay financing costs of during  we i generated cash from operating activities of  ii generated cash from the sale of rental and non rental equipment of and iii received cash from debt proceeds  net of payments  of we used cash during this period principally to i purchase rental and non rental equipment of and ii purchase other companies for free cash flow gaap reconciliation we define free cash usage flow as i net cash provided by operating activities less ii purchases of rental and non rental equipment plus iii proceeds from sales of rental and non rental equipment and excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net 
management believes that free cash usage flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements 
however  free cash usage flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under gaap 
accordingly  free cash usage flow should not be considered an alternative to net income loss or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity 
the table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash usage flow 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities purchases of rental equipment purchases of non rental equipment proceeds from sales of rental equipment proceeds from sales of non rental equipment excess tax benefits from share based payment arrangements  net free cash usage flow free cash usage for the year ended december  was  a decrease of as compared to free cash flow of for the year ended december  free cash usage increased primarily due to increased purchases of rental and non rental equipment  partially offset by increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment and non rental equipment and increased 
table of contents net cash provided by operating activities 
free cash flow for the year ended december  was  a decrease of as compared to for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  included a federal tax refund 
excluding the impact of this refund  free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased purchases of rental equipment  partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities and increased proceeds from sales of rental equipment 
we expect significant positive free cash flow in and intend to use this to reduce our leverage

table of contents interest rate risk 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  comprised of  of borrowings under the abl facility and of borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt on december  were i percent for the abl facility and ii percent for the accounts receivable securitization facility 
as of december   based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding  our annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt 
the amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding under the abl facility and accounts receivable securitization facility may fluctuate significantly 
for additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we had an aggregate of billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates  including our subordinated convertible debentures

for additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt  see notes see fair value of financial instruments and to our consolidated financial statements 
currency exchange risk 
the functional currency for our canadian operations is the canadian dollar 
as a result  our future earnings could be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us and canadian dollars
