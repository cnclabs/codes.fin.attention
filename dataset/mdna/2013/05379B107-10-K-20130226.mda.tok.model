item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations economic conditions and utility load growth for information on economic conditions in our service territory 
electric operations in addition to providing electric distribution and transmission services  we generate electricity from facilities that we own and we purchase capacity and energy and fuel for generation under long term and short term contracts 
we also sell electric capacity and energy  as well as surplus fuel in the wholesale market in connection with our resource optimization activities as described below 
as part of our resource procurement and management operations in the electric business  we engage in an ongoing process of resource optimization  which involves the economic selection from available energy resources to serve our load obligations and the use of these resources to capture available economic value 
we transact business in the wholesale markets by selling and purchasing electric capacity and energy  fuel for electric generation  and derivative instruments related to capacity  energy  transport and fuel 
such transactions are part of the process of matching resources with our load obligations and hedging the related financial risks 
these transactions range from terms of intra hour up to multiple years 
we make continuing projections of electric loads at various points in time ranging from intra hour to multiple years based on  among other things  estimates of customer usage and weather  historical data and contract terms  and resource availability at these points in time based on  among other things  fuel choices and fuel markets  estimates of streamflows  availability of generating units  historic and forward market information  contract terms  and experience 
on the basis of these projections  we make purchases and sales of electric capacity and energy  fuel for electric generation  and related derivative instruments to match expected resources to expected electric load requirements and reduce our exposure to electricity or fuel market price changes 
resource optimization involves generating plant dispatch and scheduling available resources and also includes transactions such as purchasing fuel for generation  when economical  selling fuel and substituting wholesale electric purchases  and other wholesale transactions to capture the value of generation and transmission resources and fuel delivery transport capacity contracts 
our optimization process includes entering into hedging transactions to manage risks 
transactions include both physical energy contracts and related derivative instruments 
our generation assets are interconnected through the regional transmission system and are operated on a coordinated basis to enhance load serving capability and reliability 
we provide transmission and ancillary services in eastern washington  northern idaho and western montana 
transmission revenues were million in  million in and million in electric requirements our peak electric native load requirement for occurred on august  at which time our total obligation was  mw consisting of native load of  mw  
table of contents avista corporation long term wholesale obligations of mw  and short term wholesale obligations of mw 
at that time our maximum resource capacity available was  mw  which included company owned or controlled electric generation of  mw  long term hydroelectric contracts with certain public utility districts puds of mw  long term thermal generation contract with lancaster plant of mw  other long term wholesale contracts of mw  and short term wholesale purchases of mw 
historically  our peak electric native load requirement has occurred during the winter months  however  due to a weather anomaly in  the peak electric native load requirement occurred during the summer period 
we expect our peak electric native load requirement to occur in winter periods in the future 
electric resources we have a diverse electric resource mix of company owned and contracted hydroelectric projects  thermal generating facilities  wind generation facilities  and power purchases and exchanges 
at the end of  our company owned facilities had a total net capability of  mw  of which percent was hydroelectric and percent was thermal 
see item properties for detailed information on generating facilities 
hydroelectric resources we own and operate six hydroelectric projects on the spokane river and two hydroelectric projects on the clark fork river 
hydroelectric generation is our lowest cost source per megawatt hour mwh of electricity and the availability of hydroelectric generation has a significant effect on total power supply costs 
under normal streamflow and operating conditions  we estimate that we would be able to meet approximately one half of our total average electric requirements both retail and long term wholesale with the combination of our hydroelectric generation and long term hydroelectric purchase contracts with certain puds in the state of washington 
our estimate of normal annual hydroelectric generation for including resources purchased under long term hydroelectric contracts with certain puds is average megawatts amw or million mwhs

a combination of long term contracts and spot purchases has provided  and is expected to meet  fuel requirements for the kettle falls gs 
the northeast ct  rathdrum ct  boulder park and kettle falls ct generating units are primarily used to meet peaking electric requirements 
we also operate these facilities when marginal costs are below prevailing wholesale electric prices 
these generating facilities have access to natural gas supplies that are adequate to meet their respective operating needs

palouse wind ppa in june  we entered into a year ppa with palouse wind  llc palouse wind  an affiliate of first wind holdings  llc 
under the ppa  we acquire all of the power and renewable attributes produced by a wind project that was developed by palouse wind in whitman county  washington 
the wind project has a nameplate capacity of approximately mw and is expected to produce approximately amw 
the project was completed and deliveries began during the fourth quarter of generation from palouse wind was  mwhs in we have an annual option to purchase the wind project following the th anniversary of its december commercial operation date 
other purchases  exchanges and sales in addition to the resources described above  we purchase and sell power under various long term contracts and we also enter into short term purchases and sales 
further  pursuant to the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa  as amended  we are required to purchase generation from qualifying facilities 
this includes  among other resources  hydroelectric projects  cogeneration projects and wind generation projects at rates approved by the washington utilities and transportation commission utc and the idaho public utilities commission ipuc

table of contents avista corporation hydroelectric licensing we are a licensee under the federal power act as administered by the ferc  which includes regulation of hydroelectric generation resources 
excluding the little falls hydroelectric generating project  our other seven hydroelectric plants are regulated by the ferc through two project licenses 
the licensed projects are subject to the provisions of part i of the federal power act 
these provisions include payment for headwater benefits  condemnation of licensed projects upon payment of just compensation  and take over of such projects after the expiration of the license upon payment of the lesser of net investment or fair value of the project  in either case  plus severance damages

future resource needs we have operational strategies to provide sufficient resources to meet our energy requirements under a range of operating conditions 
these operational strategies consider the amount of energy needed  which varies widely because of the factors that influence demand over intra hour  hourly  daily  monthly and annual durations 
our average hourly load was  amw in   amw in and  amw in the following is a forecast of our average annual energy requirements and resources for   and forecasted electric energy requirements and resources amw requirements system load contracts for power sales total requirements resources company owned and contract hydro generation company owned and contract thermal generation other contracts for power purchases total resources surplus resources additional available energy total surplus resources system load is reduced in because a large industrial customer will begin generating electricity to meet a portion of its own load after june  the full impact of this load change culminates in when load is reduced for calendar months 
the forecast assumes near normal hydroelectric generation decline in and is due to changes in contracts with puds 
includes our long term contract with the lancaster plant 
excludes northeast ct and rathdrum ct as these are considered peaking facilities and are generally not used to meet our base load requirements 
we generally dispatch thermal resources when operating costs are lower than short term wholesale market prices 
northeast ct and rathdrum ct 
the combined maximum capacity of the northeast ct and rathdrum ct is mw  with estimated available energy production as indicated for each year 

table of contents avista corporation in august  we filed our electric integrated resource plan irp with the utc and the ipuc 
the irp details projected growth in demand for energy and the new resources needed to serve customers over the next years 
we regard the irp as a tool for resource evaluation  rather than an acquisition plan for a particular project 
highlights of the irp include a contract for the mw palouse wind  llc project  which provides a new resource to serve our customers increasing energy needs 
commercial operations began on december  an additional amw of wind or other renewable beginning in energy efficiency measures are expected to save amw of cumulative energy over the year irp timeframe 
this aggressive effort could reduce load growth to half of what it would be without these measures 
mw of new natural gas fired generation facilities are anticipated in two or three increments between and grid modernization programs are projected to save amw of energy by transmission upgrades will be needed to deliver the energy from new generation resources to the distribution lines serving customers 
we will continue to participate in regional efforts to expand the region s transmission system 
we are required to file an irp every two years with the next irp expected to be filed during the third quarter of our resource strategy may change from the irp based on market  legislative and regulatory developments  etc 
we are subject to the washington state energy independence act  which includes renewable energy portfolio standards and we must obtain a portion of our electricity from qualifying renewable resources or through purchase of renewable energy credits 
future generation resource decisions will be impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental issues and other contingencies for information related to existing laws  as well as potential legislation that could influence our future electric resource mix 
natural gas operations general we provide natural gas distribution services to retail customers in parts of eastern washington  northern idaho  and northeastern and southwestern oregon 
market prices for natural gas  like other commodities  can be volatile 
to provide reliable supply and to manage the impact of volatile prices on our customers  we procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases  forward fixed price purchases  and derivative instruments from various supply basins and over various time periods 
we also use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices may be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 
natural gas loads are highly variable and daily natural gas loads can differ significantly from the monthly load projections 
we make continuing projections of our natural gas loads and assess available natural gas resources 
on the basis of these projections  we plan and execute a series of transactions to hedge a significant portion of our projected natural gas requirements through forward market transactions and derivative instruments 
these transactions may extend for multiple years into the future with the highest volumes hedged for the current and most immediate upcoming natural gas operating year november through october 
we also leave a significant portion of our natural gas supply requirements unhedged for purchase in short term and spot markets 
as part of the process of balancing natural gas retail load requirements with resources  we engage in wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas 
we plan for sufficient natural gas delivery capacity to serve our retail customers on a theoretical peak day 
as such  we generally have more pipeline and storage capacity than what is needed  during periods other than a peak day 
we optimize natural gas resources by using market opportunities to generate economic value that partially offsets net natural gas costs 
wholesale sales are delivered through wholesale market facilities outside of our natural gas distribution system and  when feasible  physical delivery may be avoided through offsetting purchase and sale book out arrangements 
natural gas resource optimization activities include  but are not limited to 
table of contents avista corporation wholesale market sales of surplus natural gas supplies  and purchases and sales of natural gas to optimize use of pipeline and storage capacity 
we also provide transportation service to certain large commercial and industrial natural gas customers who purchase natural gas through third party marketers 
for these customers  we move their natural gas from natural gas transmission pipeline delivery points through our distribution system to the customers premises 
natural gas supply we purchase all of our natural gas in wholesale markets 
we are connected to multiple supply basins in the western united states and western canada through firm capacity delivery rights on six pipeline networks 
access to this diverse portfolio of natural gas resources allows us to make natural gas procurement decisions that benefit our natural gas customers 
these interstate pipeline delivery rights provide the capacity to serve approximately percent of peak natural gas customer demands from domestic sources  and percent from canadian sources 
natural gas prices in the pacific northwest are affected by global energy markets  as well as supply and demand factors in other regions of the united states and canada 
future prices and delivery constraints may cause our source mix to vary 
natural gas storage we own a one third interest in the jackson prairie natural gas storage project jackson prairie  an underground natural gas storage field located near chehalis  washington 
jackson prairie has a total peak day deliverability of million therms  with a total working natural gas capacity of million therms 
our share of the peak day deliverability and total working capacity is one third of these 
natural gas storage enables us to place natural gas into storage when prices may be lower or to satisfy minimum natural gas purchasing requirements  as well as to meet high demand periods or to withdraw natural gas from storage when spot prices are higher 
natural gas pipeline replacement in  we began implementation of a plan to replace certain vintages of aldyl a natural gas pipe within its distribution systems in washington  oregon and idaho 
in early  we released our protocol report to each state commission describing our aldyl a natural gas pipe replacement plan across its natural gas system 
later in  after technical workshops held by the utc to gather perspectives on pipeline replacement programs  including the need for expedited cost recovery  the utc required all natural gas utilities operating in washington to file applicable replacement plans with the commission 
we subsequently filed our protocol report with the utc proposing to replace our aldyl a natural gas pipe at a cost of approximately million per year  indexed to inflation  across our three state jurisdictions over a year period 
we expect to receive cost recovery for these capital expenditures from the three jurisdictions over the subsequent future life of these assets 
regulatory issues general as a public utility  we are subject to regulation by state utility commissions for prices  accounting  the issuance of securities and other matters 
the retail electric and natural gas operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the utc  the ipuc  the public utility commission of oregon opuc  and the public service commission of the state of montana montana commission 
approval of the issuance of securities is not required from the montana commission 
we are also subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc for licensing of hydroelectric generation resources  and for electric transmission services and wholesale sales 
our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide an opportunity for us to recover allowable operating expenses and earn a reasonable return on rate base 
rate base is generally determined by reference to the original cost net of accumulated depreciation of utility plant in service  subject to various adjustments for deferred taxes and other items 
over time  rate base is increased by additions to utility plant in service and reduced by depreciation and retirement of utility plant and write offs as authorized by the utility commissions 
our operating expenses and rate base are allocated or directly assigned among five regulatory jurisdictions electric in washington and idaho  and natural gas in washington  idaho and oregon 
in general  a request for new rates in washington and idaho is made on the basis of net investment as of a date  and operating expenses and revenues for a test year that ended prior to the date of the request  plus certain adjustments designed to reflect expected revenues  expenses and net investment during the period new retail rates will be in effect 
although the current ratemaking process in these states provides recovery of some future changes in net investment  operating costs and revenues  it does not reflect all changes in costs for the period in which new retail rates will be in place 
this historically has resulted in a lag between the time we incur costs and the time when we start recovering the costs through subsequent changes in rates 
oregon currently allows a forecasted test year  which generally is more effective in providing timely recovery of costs 

table of contents avista corporation our rates for wholesale electric and natural gas transmission services are based on either cost of service principles or market based rates as set forth by the ferc 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about regulation  depreciation and deferred income taxes 
general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases for information on general rate case activity 
power cost deferrals we defer the recognition in the income statement of certain power supply costs that vary from the level currently recovered from our retail customers as authorized by the utc and the ipuc 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations avista utilities regulatory matters power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed information on power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms in washington and idaho 
purchased gas adjustment pga under established regulatory practices in each state  we are allowed to adjust natural gas rates periodically with regulatory approval to reflect increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas purchased 
differences between actual natural gas costs and the natural gas costs included in retail rates are deferred during the period the differences are incurred 
during the subsequent period when regulators approve inclusion of the cost changes in rates  any amounts that were previously deferred are charged or credited to expense 
we typically propose such pgas at least once per year

federal laws related to wholesale competition federal law promotes practices that open the electric wholesale energy market to competition 
the ferc requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  and requires electric utilities to enhance or construct transmission facilities to create additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services 
public utilities through subsidiaries or affiliates and other entities may participate in the development of independent electric generating plants for sales to wholesale customers 
public utilities operating under the federal power act are required to provide open and non discriminatory access to their transmission systems to third parties and establish an open access same time information system to provide an electronic means by which transmission customers can obtain information about available transmission capacity and purchase transmission access 
the ferc also requires each public utility subject to the rules to operate its transmission and wholesale power merchant operating functions separately and to comply with standards of conduct designed to ensure that all wholesale users  including the public utility s power merchant operations  have equal access to the public utility s transmission system 
our compliance with these standards has not had any substantive impact on the operation  maintenance and marketing of our transmission system or our ability to provide service to customers 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations competition for further information 
regional transmission organizations beginning with ferc orders no 
and no 
issued in and continuing with subsequent rulemakings and policies including the variable energy resource order no 
and the transmission planning and cost allocation order no 
 the ferc has encouraged better coordination and operational consistency aimed to capture efficiencies that might otherwise be gained through the formation of a regional transmission organization rto such as an independent system operator iso 
while it has not mandated rto formation  the ferc has issued orders and made public policy statements indicating its support for the development and formation of independent organizations  including those intended to implement a number of regional transmission planning coordination requirements 
we have participated in discussions with transmission providers and other stakeholders in the pacific northwest for several years regarding the possible formation of an iso in the region 
columbiagrid is a washington nonprofit membership corporation with an independent slate of directors formed to improve the operational efficiency  reliability  and planned expansion of the transmission grid in the pacific northwest and we became a member of columbiagrid in during its formation 
columbiagrid is not an iso  but performs limited functions as set forth in specific agreements with columbiagrid members and other stakeholders  and fills the role of coordinating avista regional planning as required in order no 
and any clarifying orders 
columbiagrid and its members also work with other western organizations to address operational efficiencies  including westconnect and the northern tier transmission group nttg 
we became a registered planning 
table of contents avista corporation participant of the nttg during we will continue to assess the benefits of entering into other functional agreements with columbiagrid and or participating in other forums to attain operational efficiencies and to meet ferc policy objectives 
the ferc requires rtos to provide various data and is currently requesting non rto regions to report similar data for the purpose of establishing performance metrics 
we expect the ferc to use this data to compare rto and non rto regions 
we cannot foresee what policy objectives the ferc may develop as a result of establishing such performance metrics 
reliability standards among its other provisions  the us energy policy act provides for the implementation of mandatory reliability standards and authorizes the ferc to assess fines for non compliance with these standards and other ferc regulations 
the ferc certified the north american electricity reliability corporation nerc as the single electric reliability organization authorized to establish and enforce reliability standards and delegate authority to regional entities for the purpose of establishing and enforcing reliability standards 
the ferc has approved nerc reliability standards  including western region standards  making up the set of legally enforceable standards for the united states bulk electric system 
the first of these reliability standards became effective in june we are required to self certify our compliance with these standards on an annual basis and undergo regularly scheduled periodic reviews by the nerc and its regional entity  the western electricity coordinating council wecc 
our failure to comply with these standards could result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
annual self certification and audit processes to date have demonstrated our substantial compliance with these standards

item a 
risk factors risk factors the following factors could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
these factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission including this annual report on form k  and elsewhere 
please also see forward looking statements for additional factors which could have a significant impact on our operations  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows and could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such statements 
weather temperatures  precipitation levels and storms has a significant effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
weather impacts are described in the following subtopics retail electricity and natural gas sales  the cost of natural gas supply  the cost of power supply  and damages to facilities 
certain retail electricity and natural gas sales volumes vary directly with changes in temperatures 
we normally have our highest retail electric and natural gas energy sales during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year 
we also have high electricity demand for air conditioning during the summer third quarter 
in general  warmer weather in the heating season and cooler weather in the cooling season will reduce our customers energy demand and retail operating revenues 
the cost of natural gas supply tends to increase with higher demand during periods of cold weather 
increased costs adversely affect cash flows when we purchase natural gas for retail supply at prices above the amount then allowed for recovery in retail rates 
we defer differences between actual natural gas supply costs and the amount currently recovered in retail rates and we have generally been allowed to recover substantially all of these differences after regulatory review 
however  these deferred costs require cash outflows from the time of natural gas purchases until the costs are later recovered through retail sales 
the cost of power supply can be significantly impacted by weather 
precipitation consisting of snowpack  its water content and melting pattern plus rainfall and other streamflow conditions such as regional water storage operations significantly affect hydroelectric generation capability 
variations in hydroelectric generation inversely affect our reliance on market purchases and thermal generation 
to the extent that hydroelectric generation is less than normal  significantly more costly power supply resources must be acquired and the ability to realize net benefits from surplus hydroelectric wholesale sales 
table of contents avista corporation is reduced 
wholesale prices also vary to a greater extent each year based on wind patterns as wind generation facilities have grown significantly in the region 
the price of power in the wholesale energy markets tends to be higher during periods of high regional demand  such as occurs with temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase power in the wholesale market during peak price periods 
the price of natural gas as fuel for natural gas fired electric generation also tends to increase during periods of high demand which are often related to temperature extremes 
we may need to purchase natural gas fuel in these periods of high prices to meet electric demands 
the cost of power supply during peak usage periods may be higher than the retail sales price or the amount allowed in retail rates by our regulators 
to the extent that power supply costs are above the amount allowed currently in retail rates  the difference is partially absorbed by the company in current expense and it is partially deferred or shared with customers through regulatory mechanisms 
as a result of these combined factors  our net cost of power supply the difference between our costs of generation and market purchases  reduced by our revenue from wholesale sales varies significantly because of weather 
damages to facilities may be caused by severe weather  such as snow  ice or wind storms 
the cost to implement rapid repair to such facilities can be significant 
overhead electric lines are most susceptible to such severe weather 
collateral damage from utility assets that are damaged by external forces may result in third party claims against the company for property damage and or personal injuries 
regulators may not grant rates that provide timely or sufficient recovery of our costs or allow a reasonable rate of return for our shareholders 
we have experienced higher costs for utility operations in each of the last several years 
we have also made significant capital investments into utility plant assets 
our ability to recover these costs depends on the amount and timeliness of retail rate changes allowed by regulatory agencies 
we expect to periodically file for rate increases with regulatory agencies to recover our costs and provide an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return for shareholders 
if regulators grant substantially lower rate increases than our requests in the future or if deferred costs are disallowed  it could have a negative effect on our operating revenues  net income and cash flows 
in addition  provisions to our approved settlement in the washington general rate cases in and our proposed settlement to the idaho general rate cases in  do not prevent us from filing general rate cases in these two jurisdictions in  however  new rates from these general rate case filings would not take effect prior to january  energy commodity price changes affect our cash flows and results of operations 
energy commodity prices can be quite volatile 
a combination of factors exposes our operations to commodity price risks 
we rely on energy markets and other counterparties for energy supply  surplus and optimization transactions and commodity price hedging 
these factors include our obligation to serve our retail customers at rates set through the regulatory process 
we cannot change retail rates to reflect current energy prices unless and until we receive regulatory approval 
customer demand  which is beyond our control because of weather  customer choices  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
some of our energy supply cost is fixed by nature of the energy producing assets or through contractual arrangements 
however  a significant portion of our energy resource costs are not fixed 
because we must supply the amount of energy demanded by our customers and we must sell it at fixed rates and only a portion of our energy supply costs are fixed  we are subject to the risk of buying energy at higher prices in wholesale energy markets and the risk of selling energy at lower prices if we are in a surplus position 
electricity and natural gas in wholesale markets are commodities with historically high price volatility 
changes in wholesale energy prices affect  among other things  the cash requirements to purchase electricity and natural gas for retail customers or wholesale obligations and the market value of derivative assets and liabilities 
when we enter into fixed price energy commodity transactions for future delivery  we are subject to credit terms that may require us to provide collateral to wholesale counterparties related to the difference between current prices and the agreed upon fixed prices 
these collateral requirements can place significant demands on our cash flows or borrowing arrangements 
price volatility can cause collateral requirements to change quickly and significantly 

table of contents avista corporation cash flow deferrals related to energy commodities can be significant 
we are permitted to collect from customers only amounts approved by regulatory commissions 
however  our costs to provide energy service can be much higher or lower than the amounts currently billed to customers 
we are permitted to defer most of this difference for review by the regulatory commissions who have discretion as to the extent and timing of future recovery or refund to customers 
power and natural gas costs higher than those recovered in retail rates reduce cash flows 
amounts that are not allowed for deferral or which are not approved to become part of customer rates affect our results of operations 
we defer income statement recognition and recovery from customers of certain power and natural gas costs that are higher or lower than what is currently authorized in retail rates by regulators 
these power and natural gas costs are recorded as deferred charges with the opportunity for future recovery through retail rates 
these deferred costs are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators 
despite the opportunity to recover deferred power and natural gas costs  our operating cash flows can be negatively affected until these costs are recovered from customers 
our energy resource risk management processes can cause volatility in our cash flows and results of operations 
we engage in active hedging and resource optimization practices but we cannot and do not attempt to fully hedge our energy resource assets or our forecasted net positions for various time horizons 
to reduce energy cost volatility and economic exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  we routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity and natural gas  as well as forecasted excess or deficit energy positions and inventories of natural gas 
we use physical energy contracts and derivative instruments  such as forwards  futures  swaps and options traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
we do not cover the entire market price volatility exposure for our forecasted net positions 
to the extent we have positions that are not hedged  or if hedging positions do not fully match the corresponding purchase or sale  fluctuating commodity prices could have a material effect on our operating revenues  resource costs  derivative assets and liabilities  and operating cash flows 
in addition  actual loads and resources typically vary from forecasts  sometimes to a significant degree  which require additional transactions or dispatch decisions that impact cash flows 
the hedges we enter into are reviewed for prudence by the various regulators and any deferred costs including those as a result of our hedging transactions are subject to review for prudence and potential disallowance by regulators 
we rely on regular access to financial markets but we cannot assure favorable or reasonable financing terms will be available when we need them 
access to capital markets is critical to our operations and our capital structure 
we have significant capital requirements that we expect to fund  in part  by accessing capital markets 
as such  the state of financial markets and credit availability in the global  united states and regional economies impacts our financial condition 
we could experience increased borrowing costs or limited access to capital on reasonable terms 
we access long term capital markets to finance capital expenditures  repay maturing long term debt and obtain additional working capital from time to time 
our ability to access capital on reasonable terms is subject to numerous factors and market conditions  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain capital on reasonable terms  it may limit or prohibit our ability to finance capital expenditures and repay maturing long term debt 
our liquidity needs could exceed our short term credit availability and lead to defaults on various financing arrangements 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
performance of the financial markets could also result in significant declines in the market values of assets held by our pension plan and or a significant increase in the pension liability which impacts the funded status of the plan and could increase future funding obligations and pension expense 
we rely on credit from financial institutions for short term borrowings 
we need adequate levels of credit with financial institutions for short term liquidity 
we have a million committed line of credit that is scheduled to expire in february there is no assurance that we will have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
the committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions 
in the event of default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
in july  ecova entered into a million committed line of credit agreement with various financial institutions that replaced its million committed line of credit agreement and has an expiration date of july there is no assurance 
table of contents avista corporation that we will have access to credit beyond the expiration date 
the committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions  and based on certain covenant conditions contained in the credit agreement  at december   ecova could borrow an additional million and still be compliant with the covenants 
the covenant restrictions are calculated on a rolling twelve month basis  so this additional borrowing capacity could increase or decrease or ecova could be required to pay down the outstanding debt as future results change 
see further discussion of the specific covenants in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ecova credit agreement 
in the event of default  it would be difficult for ecova to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
downgrades in our credit ratings could impede our ability to obtain financing  adversely affect the terms of financing and impact our ability to transact for or hedge energy resources 
if we do not maintain our investment grade credit rating with the major credit rating agencies  we could expect increased debt service costs  limitations on our ability to access capital markets or obtain other financing on reasonable terms  and requirements to provide collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit to lenders and counterparties 
in addition  credit rating downgrades could reduce the number of counterparties willing to do business with us 
we are subject to various operational and event risks that are associated with the utility industry 
our utility operations are subject to operational and event risks that include blackouts or disruptions to distribution  transmission or transportation systems  forced outages at generating plants  fuel cost and availability  including delivery constraints  explosions  fires  accidents  or mechanical breakdowns that may occur while operating and maintaining our generation  transmission and distribution systems  and natural disasters that can disrupt energy generation  transmission and distribution 
as protection against operational and event risks  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses and we seek to negotiate indemnification arrangements with contractors for certain event risks 
however  insurance or indemnification agreements may not be adequate to protect us against liability  extra expenses and operating disruptions from all of the operational and event risks described above 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that insurers and or other parties will dispute or be unable to perform on their obligations to us 
ecova  may be unable to attain the level or timeliness of growth we expect 
ecova operations involve several recent acquisitions and may include other acquisitions as opportunities warrant 
there are various uncertainties involved with assimilating acquired operations  achieving revenue growth and operating synergies in acquired operations 
ecova organic growth and its ability to manage costs with the dynamics of growth and emerging business processes make it more difficult to accurately forecast cash flows and results of operations 
as a result  earnings may be more volatile and cash flows may be irregular in this business segment 
cyber attacks  terrorism or other malicious acts could disrupt our businesses and have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
in the course of our operations  we rely on interconnected technology systems for operation of our generating plants  electric transmission and distribution systems  natural gas distribution systems  customer billing and customer service  accounting and other administrative processes and compliance with various regulations 
there are various risks associated with technology systems such as hardware or software failure  communications failure  data distortion or destruction  unauthorized access to data  misuse of proprietary or confidential data  unauthorized control through electronic means  programming mistakes and other deliberate or inadvertent human errors 
in particular  cyber attacks  terrorism or other malicious acts could damage  destroy or disrupt these systems 
any failure of technology systems could result in a loss of operating revenues  an increase in operating expenses and costs to repair or replace damaged assets 
any of the above could also result in the loss or release of confidential customer information or other proprietary data that could adversely affect our reputation and result in costly litigation 
as these potential cyber attacks become more common and sophisticated  we could be required to incur costs to strengthen our systems and respond to emerging concerns 
we are currently the subject of several regulatory proceedings  and we are named in multiple lawsuits related to our participation in western energy markets 
through our utility operations and the prior operations of avista energy  we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and complaints related to energy markets in the western united states 
most of these proceedings and complaints 
table of contents avista corporation relate to the significant increase in the spot market price of energy in and this allegedly contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices 
these proceedings and complaints include  but are not limited to refund proceedings in california and the pacific northwest  market conduct investigations by the ferc  and complaints filed by various parties related to alleged misconduct by parties in western power markets 
as a result of these proceedings and complaints  certain parties have asserted claims for significant refunds and damages from us  which could result in a negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
there have been numerous recent changes in legislation  related administrative rulemaking  and executive orders  including periodic audits of compliance with such rules  which may adversely affect our operational and financial performance 
we expect to continue to be affected by legislation at the national  state and local level  as well as by administrative rules and requirements published by government agencies  including but not limited to the ferc  the epa and state regulators 
we are also subject to nerc and wecc reliability standards 
the ferc  the nerc and the wecc may perform periodic audits of the company 
failure to comply with the ferc  the nerc  or the wecc requirements can result in financial penalties of up to million per day per violation 
future legislation or administrative rules could have a material adverse effect on our operations  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
actions or limitations to address concerns over long term global climate changes may affect our operations and financial performance 
legislative developments and advocacy at the state  national and international levels concerning climate change and other environmental issues may have significant impacts on our operations 
the electric utility industry is one of the largest and most immediate industries to be more heavily regulated in some proposals 
for example  various legislative proposals have been made to limit or place further restrictions on byproducts of combustion  including sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  carbon dioxide  and other greenhouse gases and mercury emissions 
such proposals  if adopted  could restrict the operation and raise the cost of our power generation resources 
we expect continuing activity in the future and we are evaluating the extent that potential changes to environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built or contracted with  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 
we have contingent liabilities  including certain matters related to potential environmental liabilities  and cannot predict the outcome of these matters 
in the normal course of our business  we have matters that are the subject of ongoing litigation  mediation  investigation and or negotiation 
we cannot predict the ultimate outcome or potential impact of any particular issue  including the extent  if any  of insurance coverage or that amounts payable by us may be recoverable through the ratemaking process 
we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities related to our past  present and future operations

table of contents avista corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segments we have two reportable business segments as follows avista utilities an operating division of avista corp 
that comprises our regulated utility operations 
avista utilities generates  transmits and distributes electricity and distributes natural gas 
the utility also engages in wholesale purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas 
ecova an indirect subsidiary of avista corp 
percent owned as of december  provides energy efficiency and cost management programs and services for multi site customers and utilities throughout north america 
ecova service lines include expense management services for utility and telecom needs as well as strategic energy management and efficiency services that include procurement  conservation  performance reporting  financial planning  facility optimization and continuous monitoring  and energy efficiency program management for commercial enterprises and utilities 
we have other businesses  including sheet metal fabrication  venture fund investments and real estate investments  as well as certain other operations of avista capital 
these activities do not represent a reportable business segment and are conducted by various direct and indirect subsidiaries of avista corp  including am d  doing business as metalfx 
the following table presents net income loss attributable to avista corp 
shareholders for each of our business segments and the other businesses for the year ended december dollars in thousands avista utilities ecova other net income attributable to avista corporation shareholders executive level summary overall net income attributable to avista corporation shareholders was million for  a decrease from million for this was due to a decrease in earnings at each of our businesses 
earnings at avista utilities decreased primarily due to reduced retail loads during the first and fourth quarters of the year as a result of warmer weather and due in part to lower usage at certain industrial customers  due to temporary operational challenges 
in addition  there were increases in other operating expenses including costs under a voluntary severance incentive program  and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the implementation of general rate increases 
net income at ecova decreased as revenue growth for the expense and data management services and energy management services at ecova was not as high as expected and did not offset increased operating costs 
in addition  ecova earnings were reduced by increased costs associated with completing and integrating the acquisitions of prenova and lpb and an increase in depreciation and amortization 
net income at other subsidiaries decreased due losses on investments  inclusive of an impairment loss recognized during the third quarter  increased costs associated with strategic consulting and other corporate costs  and increased litigation costs related to the previous operations of avista energy 
these losses were partially offset by positive earnings at metalfx 
these results  including a quantification of their respective impacts  are discussed in detail below 
avista utilities avista utilities is our most significant business segment 
our utility financial performance is dependent upon  among other things weather conditions  regulatory decisions  allowing our utility to recover costs  including purchased power and fuel costs  on a timely basis  and to earn a reasonable return on investment  the price of natural gas in the wholesale market  including the effect on the price of fuel for generation  and the price of electricity in the wholesale market  including the effects of weather conditions  natural gas prices and other factors affecting supply and demand 

table of contents avista corporation based on our forecasts for our utility operations for through  we expect annual electric customer growth to average percent to percent per year and annual natural gas customer growth to average percent to percent within our service area 
we anticipate retail electric load growth to average between percent and percent and natural gas load growth to average between percent and percent 
we anticipate customer and load growth at the lower end of the range in and a modest recovery as the economy strengthens during the four year period 
while the number of electric and natural gas customers is growing  the average annual usage by each residential customer has not changed significantly 
for further discussion regarding utility customer growth  load growth  and the general economic conditions in our service territory  see economic conditions and utility load growth 
in our utility operations  we regularly review the need for rate changes in each jurisdiction to improve the recovery of costs and capital investments in our generation  transmission and distribution systems 
general rate increases went into effect in idaho on october   in washington on january   and in oregon effective march   june  and june  on october  we filed electric and natural gas general rate increase requests in idaho  which are currently the subject of a settlement that is before the ipuc for approval see discussion below under idaho general rate cases 
in december  the utc approved a settlement agreement in our washington general rate cases  which were originally filed on april   that provides for electric and natural gas rate increases effective january  and january  we are making significant capital investments in generation  transmission and distribution systems to preserve and enhance service reliability for our customers and replace aging infrastructure 
utility capital expenditures were million for we expect utility capital expenditures to be about million for each of and these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment see discussion under avista utilities capital expenditures 
on october   we announced a voluntary severance incentive program to reduce our total utility workforce and achieve necessary long term  sustainable  company wide savings  in addition to other cost saving measures 
based on the response to the program by interested employees and the approvals by company management the program resulted in the termination of  or approximately percent  of the eligible non union employees  and the total severance costs under the program were million pre tax 
the long term operating and maintenance cost savings under the program are expected to exceed the severance costs of the program and the expected payback period for the severance costs will be approximately years 
all terminations under the voluntary severance incentive program were completed by december  the cost of the program was recognized as expense during the fourth quarter of and severance pay was distributed in a single lump sum cash payment to each participant during january an agreement with one of our largest electric customers  which consumes approximately amws per year  is expiring on june  we are currently renegotiating a new agreement with this customer that is expected to become effective july  the new agreement will be subject to approval from the ipuc once it is finalized 
we would expect to receive regulatory recovery of any changes in costs or revenues related to the agreement 
ecova on november   ecova acquired prenova  an atlanta based energy management company 
the cash paid for the acquisition of prenova of million was funded primarily through borrowings under ecova committed credit agreement 
on january   ecova acquired lpb  a dallas based energy management company 
the cash paid for the acquisition of lpb of million was funded by ecova through million of borrowings under its committed credit agreement  a million equity infusion from existing shareholders including avista capital and the other owners of ecova  and available cash 
while these acquisitions have grown the overall cost structure for ecova for  they have also increased both operating revenues and ecova market share and will allow ecova to offer its clients a broader range of services which should lead to potential future earnings growth as the acquisitions are integrated with ecova operations 
the acquisition of cadence network in july was funded by issuing additional ecova common stock 
under the transaction agreement  the previous owners of cadence network had a right to have their shares of ecova common stock redeemed by ecova during july or july if their investment in ecova was not liquidated through either an initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
these redemption rights were not exercised and expired effective july  and were reclassified to permanent equity  which resulted in a decrease of million in redeemable noncontrolling interests from december  the value of the remaining redeemable noncontrolling interests in ecova associated with redeemable stock options and other 
table of contents avista corporation outstanding redeemable stock was million at december   a decrease from million at december  options are valued at their maximum redemption amount which is equal to their intrinsic value fair value less exercise price 
during  the estimated fair value of ecova common stock decreased such that it is closer to the exercise price of the options which reduced the overall value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests down to their current value 
ecova plans to continue to grow organically and possibly through strategic acquisitions 
ecova acquisitions after have been funded through internally generated cash  borrowings under ecova credit facility and  in the case of lpb  an equity infusion from existing shareholders 
if ecova capital needs exceed its credit facility capacity or management determines a different capital structure is necessary  ecova may require additional equity infusions from existing shareholders and or new funding sources 
we may seek to monetize all or part of our investment in ecova in the future 
the value of a potential monetization depends on future market conditions  growth of the business and other factors 
a strategic change to ecova ownership structure may provide access to public market capital and provide potential liquidity to avista corp 
and the other owners of ecova 
there can be no assurance that such a transaction will be completed 
liquidity and capital resources we have a committed line of credit with various financial institutions in the total amount of million with an expiration date of february as of december   there were million of cash borrowings and million in letters of credit outstanding leaving million of available liquidity under this line of credit 
in july  ecova entered into a five year million committed line of credit agreement with various financial institutions that replaced its million committed line of credit agreement 
as of december   ecova had million of borrowings outstanding under its committed line of credit agreement 
based on certain covenant conditions contained in the credit agreement  at december   ecova could borrow an additional million and still be compliant with the covenants 
the covenant restrictions are calculated on a rolling twelve month basis  so this additional borrowing capacity could increase or decrease or ecova could be required to pay down the outstanding debt as future results change 
we expect ecova earnings to increase in the future  so we expect the excess borrowing capacity to increase as well 
see further discussion of the specific covenants below under ecova credit agreement 
in november  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in as an obligation of avista corp 
net total proceeds from the sale of the new bonds were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our million committed line of credit and for general corporate purposes 
there are million in first mortgage bonds maturing in and we expect to issue up to million of long term debt during the second half of in may  we cash settled interest rate swap contracts notional amount of million and paid a total of million 
the interest rate swap contracts were settled in connection with the pricing of million of first mortgage bonds as described above 
upon settlement of the interest rate swaps  the regulatory asset or liability included as part of long term debt is amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the forecasted interest payments 
in august  we entered into two sales agency agreements under which we may issue up to million shares of our common stock from time to time 
in  we sold million shares and received net proceeds of million net of issuance costs 
as of december   we had million shares available to be issued under these agreements 
in we received net proceeds of million net of issuance costs by issuing common stock  including million under our sales agency agreements 
during  we expect to issue up to million of common stock in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
after considering the issuances of long term debt and common stock during  we expect net cash flows from operating activities  together with cash available under our million committed line of credit agreement  to provide adequate resources to fund capital expenditures  dividends  and other contractual commitments 
avista utilities regulatory matters general rate cases we regularly review the need for electric and natural gas rate changes in each state in which we provide service 
we will continue to file for rate adjustments to provide for recovery of operating costs and capital investments  and provide the opportunity to improve our earned returns as allowed by regulators 
with regards to the timing and plans for future filings  the assessment of our need for rate relief and the development of rate case plans takes into consideration short term and long term needs  as well as specific factors that can affect the timing of rate filings 
such factors include  but are not limited to  in service dates of major capital investments and the timing of changes in 
table of contents avista corporation major revenue and expense items 
we filed general rate cases in washington in may which were settled with new rates effective january  and in idaho in july which were settled with new rates effective october  
we filed general rate cases in washington in april which were settled with new rates effective january  and january  and idaho in october which are the subject of a settlement that is before the ipuc see discussion below under idaho general rate cases 
washington general rate cases in november  the utc approved an all party settlement stipulation in our general rate case filed in march as agreed to in the settlement stipulation  electric rates for washington customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
natural gas rates for washington customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on december  in december  the utc approved a settlement agreement in our electric and natural gas general rate cases filed in may as agreed to in the settlement agreement  base electric rates for our washington customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
base natural gas rates for our washington customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on january  the settlement agreement provided for the deferral of certain generation plant maintenance costs 
in order to address the variability in year to year maintenance costs  beginning in  we deferred certain changes in maintenance costs related to our coyote springs natural gas fired generation plant and our percent ownership interest in units of the colstrip generation plant 
these maintenance costs may be much higher in certain years because certain significant maintenance procedures are less frequent than annual and  therefore  may not be properly represented in test year expenses used in our filed rate requests 
for and the company compared actual  non fuel  maintenance expenses for the coyote springs and colstrip plants with the amount of baseline maintenance expenses used to establish base retail rates  and deferred the difference 
this deferral occurred annually  with no carrying charge  with deferred costs being amortized over a four year period  beginning in the year following the period costs are deferred 
the amount of expense to be requested for recovery in future general rate cases would be the actual maintenance expense recorded in the test period  less any amount deferred during the test period  plus the amortization of previously deferred costs 
total net deferred costs under this mechanism in washington were a regulatory asset of million as of december  compared to a regulatory liability of million as of december  as part of the settlement agreement in october to our latest general rate case discussed in further detail below  the parties have agreed that the maintenance cost deferral mechanism on these generation plants will terminate on december   with the four year amortization of the and deferrals to conclude in and  respectively 
in december  the utc approved a settlement agreement in our electric and natural gas general rate cases filed in april as agreed to in the settlement  effective january   base rates for our washington electric customers increased by an overall percent designed to increase annual revenues by million  and base rates for our washington natural gas customers increased by an overall percent designed to increase annual revenues by million 
the settling parties agree that a one year credit of million will be returned to electric customers from the existing energy recovery mechanism erm deferral balance so the net average electric rate increase to our customers in will be percent 
the credit to customers from the erm balance will not impact our earnings 
the settlement also provided that  effective january   we will increase base rates for our washington electric customers by an overall percent designed to increase annual revenues by million  and for our washington natural gas customers by an overall percent designed to increase annual revenues by million 
the settling parties agree that a one year credit of million will be returned to electric customers from the then existing erm deferral balance  if such funds are available  so the net average electric rate increase to our customers effective january  will be percent 
the credit to customers from the erm balance will not impact our earnings 
the utc order approving the settlement agreement included certain conditions 
the new retail rates to become effective january  will be temporary rates  and on january  electric and natural gas base rates will revert back to levels absent any intervening action from the utc 
included in the original settlement agreement is a provision that we will not file a general rate case in washington seeking new rates to take effect before january  we can  however  make a filing prior to january   but new rates resulting from the filing would not take effect prior to january  we currently intend to file a general rate case in early with proposed rates that would take effect on january  this provision does not preclude us from filing annual rate adjustments such as the pca and the pga 
in addition  in its order  the utc found that much of the approved base rate increases is justified by the planned capital expenditures necessary to upgrade and maintain our utility facilities 
if these capital projects are not completed to a level that was contemplated in the original settlement agreement  this could result in base rates which are considered too high by the 
table of contents avista corporation utc 
as a result  we must file capital expenditure progress reports with the utc on a periodic basis so that the utc can monitor the capital expenditures and ensure they are in line with those contemplated in the settlement agreement 
we expect total utility capital expenditures among all jurisdictions to be approximately million for each of and the settlement agreement provides for an authorized return on equity of percent and an equity ratio of percent  resulting in an overall return on rate base of percent 
idaho general rate cases in september  the ipuc approved a settlement agreement with respect to our general rate case filed in march the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on october  as agreed to in the settlement  base electric rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
base natural gas rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which was designed to increase annual revenues by million 
the settlement agreement included a rate mitigation plan under which the impact on customers of the new rates was reduced by amortizing million million when grossed up for income taxes and other revenue related items of previously deferred state income taxes over a two year period as a credit to customers 
while our cash collections from customers are reduced by this amortization during the two year period  the mitigation plan has no impact on our net income 
retail rates increased on october  and october  as the previously deferred state income tax balance was amortized 
in september  the ipuc approved a settlement agreement in our general rate case filed in july the new electric and natural gas rates became effective on october  as agreed to in the settlement agreement  base electric rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which is designed to increase annual revenues by million 
base natural gas rates for our idaho customers increased by an average of percent  which is designed to increase annual revenues by million 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed not to file a general rate case seeking changes in base electric or natural gas rates effective prior to april  this does not preclude us from filing annual rate adjustments such as the pca and the pga 
the settlement agreement also provides for the deferral of certain generation plant operation and maintenance costs 
in order to address the variability in year to year operation and maintenance costs  beginning in  we are deferring certain changes in operation and maintenance costs related to the coyote springs natural gas fired generation plant and our percent ownership interest in units of the colstrip generation plant 
we compare actual  non fuel  operation and maintenance expenses for the coyote springs and colstrip plants with the amount of expenses authorized for recovery in base rates in the applicable deferral year  and defer the difference from that currently authorized 
the deferral occurs annually  with no carrying charge  with deferred costs being amortized over a three year period  beginning in the year following the period costs are deferred 
the amount of expense to be requested for recovery in future general rate cases will be the actual operation and maintenance expense recorded in the test period  less any amount deferred during the test period  plus the amortization of previously deferred costs 
total net deferred costs under this mechanism in idaho were regulatory assets of million as of december  and million as of december  on october   we filed electric and natural gas general rate cases with the ipuc 
we requested an overall increase in electric rates of percent and an overall increase in natural gas rates of percent 
the filings were designed to increase annual electric revenues by million and increase annual natural gas revenues by million 
our requests were based on a proposed overall rate of return of percent  with a common equity ratio of percent and a percent return on equity 
on february   avista corp 
and certain other parties filed a settlement agreement with the ipuc with respect to our electric and natural gas general rate cases 
parties to the settlement agreement include the staff of the ipuc  clearwater paper corporation  idaho forest group  llc  the idaho conservation league  and the company 
community action partnership association of idaho capai  a low income customer advocacy group  and the snake river alliance did not join in the settlement agreement 
however  on february  the snake river alliance provided a letter to the ipuc supporting the settlement agreement 
this settlement agreement is subject to approval by the ipuc and would conclude the proceedings related the general rate requests filed by the company on october  new rates would be implemented in two phases april  and october  the settlement agreement proposes that  effective april   we would be authorized to implement a base rate increase for our idaho natural gas customers of percent designed to increase annual revenues by million 
there would be no change in base electric rates on april  however  the settlement agreement would provide for the recovery of the costs of the palouse wind project through the power cost adjustment mechanism beginning april  
table of contents avista corporation the settlement agreement also proposes that  effective october   we would be authorized to implement a base rate increase for our idaho natural gas customers of percent designed to increase annual revenues by million 
a credit resulting from deferred natural gas costs of million would be returned to our idaho natural gas customers from october  through december   so the net annual average natural gas rate increase to natural gas customers effective october  would be percent 
further  the settlement proposes that  effective october   we would be authorized to implement a base rate increase for our idaho electric customers of percent designed to increase annual revenues by million 
a million credit resulting from a payment to be made to us by the bonneville power administration relating to its prior use of avista corp 
s transmission system would be returned to idaho electric customers from october  through december   so the net annual average electric rate increase to electric customers effective october  would be percent 
the million credit to idaho natural gas customers and the million credit to idaho electric customers would not impact our net income 
also included in the settlement agreement is a provision that we may file a general rate case in idaho in  however  new rates resulting from the filing would not take effect prior to january  the settlement agreement provides for an authorized return on equity of percent and an equity ratio of percent 
the settlement also includes an after the fact earnings test for and  such that if avista corp  on a consolidated basis for electric and natural gas operations in idaho  earns more than a percent return on equity  we would refund to customers percent of any earnings above the percent 
oregon general rate cases in march  the opuc approved an all party settlement stipulation in our general rate case that was filed in september the settlement provided for an overall rate increase of percent for our oregon customers  designed to increase annual revenues by million 
part of the rate increase became effective march   with the remaining increase effective june  an additional rate adjustment designed to increase revenues by million became effective on june  to recover capital costs associated with certain reinforcement and replacement projects  having demonstrated that such projects were complete by november   and the costs incurred were prudent 
in addition  rates increased by an additional million  from june  through may   to recover the november through may deferred revenue requirement 
on january   we purchased the klamath falls lateral lateral  a mile  inch natural gas transmission pipeline from williams northwest pipeline williams 
the klamath falls lateral interconnects with another interstate pipeline  gas transmission northwest  to transport natural gas to serve our customers in klamath falls  oregon 
the purchase price was approximately million and will save our oregon customers approximately million annually as we will be able to reduce our contracted natural gas transportation requirements from williams 
in order no 
 the opuc approved our request to recover from customers the revenue requirement associated with the purchase of the lateral  which is approximately million annually 
this approval will provide a return of and a return on our investment in the lateral 
while the opuc approved the recovery of the revenue requirement  it will not determine whether the purchase of the lateral was prudent until our next oregon general rate case 
proposed electric decoupling washington in the september washington general rate case settlement which was approved by the utc in december  one party  the northwest energy coalition nwec  did not sign the agreement and continued to pursue an electric decoupling mechanism for us through a separate procedural schedule 
on may   the utc consolidated this issue into our april washington general rate case 
as a part of the settlement filed on october   related to our april washington general rate case  we agreed that we would not support adoption of decoupling in this case  nor seek to implement a decoupling mechanism prior to our next general rate case 
in the utc order approving the settlement agreement  however  the utc did not support this provision related to decoupling in the settlement agreement 
bonneville power administration reimbursement and reardan wind generation project on january   we filed with the utc a petition for an order that authorizes certain ratemaking treatment related to two issues the first issue relates to transmission revenues associated with a settlement between avista corp 
and the bonneville 
table of contents avista corporation power administration bonneville  whereby bonneville will reimburse the company million for its past use of our transmission system 
the second issue relates to approximately million of costs we incurred over the past several years for the development of a wind generation project site near reardan  washington 
we propose to allocate million  representing washington share of the bonneville settlement  as follows million would be allocated to benefit customers  and million would be retained by the company 
with regard to the recovery of costs for reardan  we propose to use million of the washington customers share of the bonneville settlement proceeds to fully offset the washington share of reardan costs  and the remaining million would be credited to the erm balancing account for the benefit of customers 
in idaho  under the terms of the proposed rate case settlement  idaho share of the bpa settlement would be credited back to customers over months  beginning october  and we would amortize idaho share of reardan costs over a two year period  beginning april purchased gas adjustments pgas are designed to pass through changes in natural gas costs to our customers with no change in gross margin operating revenues less resource costs or net income 
effective october   natural gas rates increased percent in idaho 
effective november   natural gas rates increased percent in washington  while decreasing percent in oregon 
in oregon  we absorb gain or loss percent of the difference between actual and projected gas costs for supply that is not hedged 
total net deferred natural gas costs were a liability of million as of december  effective march   natural gas rates decreased percent in washington and percent in idaho 
effective october   natural gas rates decreased percent in idaho 
effective november   natural gas rates decreased percent in washington and percent in oregon 
total net deferred natural gas costs were a liability of million as of december  as it relates to the washington pga  effective november   the utc approved  on a temporary basis  our pga and the pgas for the other three natural gas utilities operating in washington 
the utc approved the recommendation of the staff of the utc that it be allowed more time to evaluate all four natural gas utilities hedging transactions  potential implications of instituting natural gas procurement and hedging guidelines  and potential uniformity as it relates to pga filings 
the timing for such analysis and potential workshops has not been determined 
as it relates to the oregon pga  we requested that the pga be implemented in two steps 
the first step  implemented on november   is a decrease of percent 
the second step is an additional decrease of percent  effective on january   to provide customers the net savings related to our purchase of the klamath falls lateral transmission pipeline 
power cost deferrals and recovery mechanisms the erm is an accounting method used to track certain differences between actual power supply costs  net of the margin on wholesale sales and sales of fuel  and the amount included in base retail rates for our washington customers 
in the washington general rate case settlement  the parties agreed that there would be no deferrals under the erm in deferrals under the erm resumed in total net deferred power costs under the erm were a liability of million as of december  compared to million as of december   and these balances represent the customer portion of the deferred power costs 
as part of the approved washington general rate case settlement in december  during a one year credit of million will be returned to electric customers from the existing erm deferral balance to reduce the net average electric rate increase impact to customers in additionally  during a one year credit up to million will be returned to electric customers from the then existing erm deferral balance  if such funds are available  so the net average electric rate increase impact to customers effective january  would also be reduced 
the credits to customers from the erm balances would not impact our net income 
the difference in net power supply costs under the erm primarily results from changes in short term wholesale market prices and sales and purchase volumes  the level of hydroelectric generation  the level of thermal generation including changes in fuel prices  the net value from optimization activities related to our generating resources  and retail loads 
under the erm  we absorb the cost or receive the benefit from the initial amount of power supply costs in excess of or below the level in retail rates  which is referred to as the deadband 
the annual calendar year deadband amount is currently million 
we incur the cost of  or receive the benefit from  percent of this initial power supply cost variance 
we share annual power supply cost variances between million and million with customers 
there is a percent customers 
table of contents avista corporation percent company sharing ratio when actual power supply expenses are higher surcharge to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
there is a percent customers percent company sharing ratio when actual power supply expenses are lower rebate to customers than the amount included in base retail rates within this band 
to the extent that the annual power supply cost variance from the amount included in base rates exceeds million  there is percent customers percent company sharing ratio of the cost variance 
the following is a summary of the erm annual power supply cost variability deferred for future surcharge or rebate to customers expense or benefit to the company within to million deadband higher by million to million lower by million to million higher or lower by over million under the erm  we make an annual filing on or before april of each year to provide the opportunity for the utc staff and other interested parties to review the prudence of and audit the erm deferred power cost transactions for the prior calendar year 
the erm provides for a day review period for the filing  however  the period may be extended by agreement of the parties or by utc order 
as part of the washington general rate case settlement  we proposed modifications to the erm deadband and other sharing bands in the original april general rate case filing 
the proposed modifications were not agreed to and the erm will continue unchanged 
however  the trigger point at which rates will change under the erm was modified to be million rather than the previous percent of base revenues approximately million under the mechanism 
we have a pca mechanism in idaho that allows us to modify electric rates on october of each year with ipuc approval 
under the pca mechanism  we defer percent of the difference between certain actual net power supply expenses and the amount included in base retail rates for our idaho customers 
the october rate adjustments recover or rebate power supply costs deferred during the preceding july june twelve month period 
total net power supply costs deferred under the pca mechanism were a liability of million as of december  compared to million as of december  natural gas safety regulations on february   president obama signed into law the pipeline safety  regulatory certainty and job creation act of mandating new regulations be created to address public safety concerns 
regulations include validation of pipeline records for transmission pipelines  evaluation of transmission pipelines for automatic shut off valves  consideration of increased high consequence area boundaries for transmission pipelines  increased installation of excess flow valves on gas service piping  as well as increased scrutiny on existing emergency preparedness plans  quality assurance plans and damage prevention programs  and broader federal oversight including broader use of fines and penalties to pipeline operators 
the us department of transportation has already proposed rules that address many areas of the new act and we have already complied with many of the requirements of this legislation 
we are still evaluating the act and waiting for further rules and clarifications surrounding certain portions of this act  however  we expect that any additional compliance required would not have a significant impact on our operations 
results of operations the following provides an overview of changes in our consolidated statements of income 
more detailed explanations are provided  particularly for operating revenues and operating expenses  in the business segment discussions avista utilities  ecova and the other businesses that follow this section 
compared to utility revenues decreased million  after elimination of intracompany revenues of million for and million for including intracompany revenues  electric revenues decreased million and natural gas revenues decreased million 
retail electric revenues decreased million due to a decrease in volumes sold which was primarily the result of warmer weather during the heating season and lower usage at certain industrial customers  due to temporary operational challenges at these customers 
this was mostly offset during the third quarter due to warmer weather and increased cooling loads  which increased electric use per customer and also general rate increases 
retail natural gas revenues decreased million due to a decrease in volumes caused by warmer weather 
ecova revenues increased million to million primarily as a result of ecova acquisitions of prenova effective november  and lpb effective january  
table of contents avista corporation utility resource costs decreased million  after elimination of intracompany resource costs of million for and million for including intracompany resource costs  electric resource costs decreased million and natural gas resource costs decreased million 
the decrease in electric resource costs was primarily due to a decrease in other fuel costs represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation as part of the resource optimization process and the amortization of deferred power supply costs  partially offset by an increase in fuel costs due to higher thermal generation and power purchased 
the decrease in natural gas resource costs was primarily due to a decrease in natural gas prices  partially offset by an increase in volumes 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to labor including million of costs under the voluntary severance incentive plan  increased pensions and other postretirement benefits  and electric distribution costs  partially offset by decreased electric maintenance costs which included the regulatory deferral of million of maintenance costs and outside service costs 
utility depreciation and amortization increased million driven by additions to utility plant 
ecova other operating expenses increased million primarily reflecting increased costs necessary for business growth and the acquisitions of prenova and lpb  including transaction and integration costs of million 
ecova depreciation and amortization increased million primarily due to the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with ecova acquisitions of prenova and lpb 
other non utility operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased outside service expense of million and increased consulting services and other corporate costs that can t be charged to utility customers of million 
interest expense increased million primarily due to the issuance of long term debt in december that increased the balance of long term debt outstanding 
other income net increased million primarily due to an increase in equity method earnings of million from ecova investment in the seel variable interest entity 
in prior years  this entity was consolidated and the operating revenues and expenses were included in the consolidated results of the company 
additionally  equity related afudc increased million 
these increases in other income were offset by an increase in losses on investments  including million for the impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business and the write off of our investment in a solar energy company 
income taxes decreased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for the decrease in expense was primarily due to a decrease in income before income taxes 
compared to utility revenues increased million  after elimination of intracompany revenues of million in and million in including intracompany revenues  electric revenues increased million and natural gas revenues increased million 
retail electric revenues increased million due to general rate increases and an increase in volumes sold caused by colder weather during the first three months of compared to retail natural gas revenues increased million due to an increase in volumes caused by colder weather and prices from rate increases 
ecova revenues increased million to million primarily due to growth in expense management and energy management services  as well as the acquisition of loyalton effective december  revenues from our other businesses increased million excluding intercompany revenues primarily due to increased sales at metalfx 
utility resource costs decreased million  after elimination of intracompany resource costs of million in and million in including intracompany resource costs  electric resource costs increased million and natural gas resource costs increased million 
the increase in electric resource costs was primarily due to an increase in other fuel costs represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation as part of the resource optimization process and the amortization of deferred power supply costs  partially offset by a decrease in fuel costs due to lower thermal generation and power purchased due in part to higher hydroelectric generation 
the increase in natural gas resource costs was primarily due to an increase in natural gas purchased due to an increase in retail sales 
utility other operating expenses increased million primarily due to increased maintenance expenses including planned major maintenance at colstrip  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and labor 
utility depreciation and amortization increased million driven by additions to utility plant 

table of contents avista corporation utility taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily reflecting higher retail revenue related taxes  as well as increased property taxes 
ecova other operating expenses increased million reflecting increased costs necessary for business growth and the acquisition of loyalton 
interest expense decreased million primarily due to refinancing transactions completed in december that lowered our effective rate on long term debt 
this was partially offset by higher interest rates on short term borrowings 
capitalized interest increased million due to higher average construction work in progress balances and higher borrowing rates including an increase on short term borrowing rates used in the calculation 
other income net decreased million primarily due to a decrease in losses on investments including a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business recorded in  partially offset by a decrease in equity related afudc 
income taxes increased million and our effective tax rate was percent for compared to percent for this increase in expense was primarily due to an increase in income before income taxes 
adjustments associated with reconciling the federal income tax return to the amount included in the financial statements for and prior year income tax return amendments decreased income tax expense by million for avista utilities non gaap financial measures the following discussion includes two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures  electric gross margin and natural gas gross margin 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
the presentation of electric gross margin and natural gas gross margin is intended to supplement an understanding of avista utilities operating performance 
we use these measures to determine whether the appropriate amount of energy costs are being collected from our customers to allow for recovery of operating costs  as well as to analyze how changes in loads due to weather  economic or other conditions  rates  supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations 
these measures are not intended to replace income from operations as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance 
the calculations of electric and natural gas gross margins are presented below 
compared to net income for avista utilities was million for  a decrease from million for avista utilities income from operations was million for compared to million for the decrease in net income and income from operations was primarily due to reduced retail loads during the first and fourth quarters of the year and an increase in other operating expenses including costs for the voluntary severance incentive program  and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the implementation of general rate increases 
the decrease in net income from avista utilities was also due to an increase in interest expense 
the following table presents our operating revenues  resource costs and resulting gross margin for the year ended december dollars in thousands electric natural gas intracompany total operating revenues resource costs gross margin avista utilities operating revenues decreased million and resource costs decreased million  which resulted in an increase of million in gross margin 
the gross margin on electric sales increased million and the gross margin on natural gas sales decreased million 
the increase in electric gross margin was primarily due to general rate increases 
this was partially offset by warmer weather during the heating season primarily the first and fourth quarters that reduced retail loads 
in addition  electric gross margin growth was limited in part by lower usage at certain industrial customers due to temporary operational challenges 
natural gas gross margin decreased primarily due to warmer weather throughout the year that reduced retail heating loads  partially offset by general rate increases 
for  we recognized a pre tax benefit of million under the erm in washington compared to million for 
table of contents avista corporation intracompany revenues and resource costs represent purchases and sales of natural gas between our natural gas distribution operations and our electric generation operations as fuel for our generation plants

the decrease in mwhs sold was primarily the result of warmer weather during the heating season  and due in part to lower usage at certain industrial customers due to temporary operational challenges 
this was partially offset during the cooling season due to warmer weather and increased loads  which increased electric use per customer 
compared to  residential electric use per customer decreased percent 
cooling degree days at spokane were percent above historical average for and were percent above heating degree days at spokane were percent below historical average for  and percent below the increase in revenue per mwh was primarily due to the washington and idaho general rate increases 
wholesale electric revenues increased million due to an increase in sales volumes increased revenues million  partially offset by a decrease in sales prices decreased revenues million 
the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to the fact that our retail sales were lower than expected  as discussed above  and we sold the resulting excess capacity  energy and fuel on the wholesale market through our optimization procedures 
when electric wholesale market prices are below the cost of operating our natural gas fired thermal generating units  we sell the natural gas purchased for generation in the wholesale market rather than operate the generating units 
the revenues from sales of fuel decreased million due to a decrease in sales of natural gas fuel as part of thermal generation resource optimization activities and higher usage of our thermal generation plants in as compared to  as well as a decrease in natural gas prices 
higher usage of our thermal generation plants was due in part to decreased hydroelectric generation 
for  million of these sales were made to our natural gas operations and are included as intracompany revenues and resource costs

the washington erm surcharge was eliminated in february  since the previous balance of deferred power costs had been recovered 
during  actual power supply costs were below the amount included in base retail rates and we deferred million in washington and million in idaho for potential future rebate to customers 
fuel for generation increased million primarily due to an increase in thermal generation 
this was due in part to a decrease in hydroelectric generation 
the increase in thermal generation usage was partially offset by a decrease in natural gas fuel prices 
other fuel costs decreased million 
this represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation  as part of the resource optimization process 
when the fuel is sold  the revenue generated from selling the fuel is included in the sales of fuel revenue line item above 
the expense for natural gas purchased decreased million due to a decrease in the price of natural gas decreased costs million  partially offset by an increase in total therms purchased increased costs million

other fuel costs increased million 
this represents fuel that was purchased for generation but was later sold when conditions indicated that it was not economical to use the fuel for generation  as part of the resource optimization process 
the associated revenues are reflected as sales of fuel 
the expense for natural gas purchased increased million due to an increase in total therms purchased increased costs million  partially offset by a decrease in the price of natural gas decreased costs million 
total therms purchased increased due to an increase in retail loads resulting from colder weather in the heating season and an increase in wholesale sales with the balancing of loads and resources as part of the natural gas procurement and resource optimization process 
we engage in optimization of available interstate pipeline transportation and storage capacity through wholesale purchases and sales of natural gas to generate economic value that offsets net natural gas costs 
during  natural gas resource costs were reduced by million reflecting the rebate of a deferred liability for natural gas costs through the purchased gas adjustments 
ecova compared to ecova net income attributable to avista corp 
shareholders was million for compared to net income of million for operating revenues increased million and total operating expenses increased million 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily the result of the acquisitions of prenova effective november  and lpb effective january   which added million to operating revenues for over revenues 
in addition  there were delays associated with the process of onboarding new customers onto the monitoring system for energy management services due to more complex customers and systems  and there was a reduction in revenues related to the deconsolidation of a partnership 
this  combined with the increased operating expenses has contributed to a net decrease in net income attributable to avista corp 
shareholders 

table of contents avista corporation the increase in total operating expenses primarily reflects increased costs necessary to support ongoing and future business growth  as well as to support the increased revenue volume obtained through the acquisitions 
there were increases in employee costs of million  facilities costs of million  and information technology costs and professional fees of million 
in addition  ecova incurred million in transaction and integration costs 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to intangibles recorded in connection with the acquisitions 
included in the increased depreciation and amortization is an impairment loss of million pre tax million after tax related to the write off of internally developed software during the fourth quarter of as of december   ecova had expense management customers representing  billed sites in north america 
in  ecova managed bills totaling billion  an increase of billion as compared to this increase was due to an increase in the number of accounts managed mostly due to acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in the average value of each bill due in part to a decline in natural gas rates 
the increases in the number of accounts and the total bills managed indicates an increase in the use of ecova services and provides support for potential future revenue growth 
compared to ecova s net income attributable to avista corp 
shareholders was million for compared to million for operating revenues increased million and total operating expenses increased million 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to growth in energy management and expense management services  as well as the acquisition of loyalton effective december   which added million to operating revenues 
ecova s organic revenue growth was approximately percent from to the increase in operating expenses primarily reflects increased costs necessary for business growth and the acquisition of loyalton 
the acquisition of prenova  effective november   had minimal impact to results 
during the fourth quarter of  ecova determined that certain revenues  which had previously been reported net of expenses  should be reported on a gross basis 
this increased operating revenues and expenses by million with no impact to net income for as of december   ecova had expense management customers representing  billed sites in north america 
in  ecova managed bills totaling billion  an increase of billion as compared to other businesses compared to the net loss from these operations was million for compared to a net loss of million for the decline in results was due in part to losses on investments of million for compared to million for the losses for were primarily the result of an impairment loss of million pre tax million after tax recognized during the third quarter of related to the impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business and the write off of our investment in a solar energy company 
additionally  there were increased costs associated with strategic consulting and other corporate costs of million and litigation costs related to the previous operations of avista energy of million 
these losses were partially offset by metalfx which had net income of million for and million for compared to the net loss from these operations was million for compared to million for operating revenues decreased million and total operating expenses decreased million 
the decrease in operating revenues and operating expenses was primarily due to the assignment of the lancaster ppa to avista corp 
in december earnings from metalfx increased to million for compared to million for losses on investments were million for compared to losses of million for the loss for included a million impairment of our investment in a fuel cell business 
accounting standards to be adopted in at this time  we are not expecting the adoption of accounting standards to have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows in for information on accounting standards adopted in and earlier periods  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are considered reasonably possible and may have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and thus actual results could differ from the amounts reported and disclosed herein 
the following accounting policies represent those that our management believes are particularly important to the consolidated financial statements that require the use of estimates and assumptions 
table of contents avista corporation avista utilities operating revenues operating revenues for our utility business related to the sale of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to our customers 
the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each calendar month  we estimate the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated and recorded 
our estimate of unbilled revenue is based on the number of customers  current rates  meter reading dates  actual native load for electricity  and actual throughput for natural gas 
any difference between actual and estimated revenue is automatically corrected in the following month when the actual meter reading and customer billing occurs 
regulatory accounting we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
this requires that certain costs and or obligations such as incurred power and natural gas costs not currently recovered through rates  but expected to be recovered in the future be reflected as deferred charges on our consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in our consolidated statements of income until the period during which matching revenues are recognized 
we expect to recover our regulatory assets through future rates 
our regulatory assets are subject to review for prudence and recoverability 
as such  certain deferred costs may be disallowed by our regulators 
if at some point in the future we determine that we no longer meet the criteria for continued application of regulatory accounting for all or a portion of our regulated operations  we could be required to write off regulatory assets  and precluded from the future deferral of costs not recovered through rates when such costs are incurred  even if we expect to recover such costs in the future 
utility energy commodity derivative assets and liabilities our utility enters into forward contracts to purchase or sell a specified amount of energy at a specified time  or during a specified period  in the future 
these contracts are entered into as part of our management of loads and resources and certain contracts are considered derivative instruments 
the utc and the ipuc issued accounting orders authorizing us to offset commodity derivative assets or liabilities with a regulatory asset or liability 
this accounting treatment is intended to defer the recognition of mark to market gains and losses on energy commodity transactions until the period of settlement 
the orders provide for us to not recognize the unrealized gain or loss on utility derivative commodity instruments in the consolidated statements of income 
realized gains or losses are recognized in the period of settlement  subject to approval for recovery through retail rates 
realized gains and losses  subject to regulatory approval  result in adjustments to retail rates through purchased gas cost adjustments  the erm in washington  the pca mechanism in idaho  and periodic general rates cases 
we use quoted market prices and forward price curves to estimate the fair value of our utility derivative commodity instruments 
as such  the fair value of utility derivative commodity instruments recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is sensitive to market price fluctuations that can occur on a daily basis 
pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans we have a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all regular full time employees at avista utilities 
our finance committee of the board of directors approves investment policies  objectives and strategies that seek an appropriate return for the pension plan and it reviews and approves changes to the investment and funding policies 
we have contracted with an independent investment consultant who is responsible for managing monitoring the individual investment managers 
the investment managers performance and related individual fund performance is reviewed at least quarterly by an internal benefits committee and by the finance committee to monitor compliance with our established investment policy objectives and strategies 

table of contents avista corporation our pension plan assets are invested primarily in marketable debt and equity securities 
pension plan assets may also be invested in real estate  absolute return  venture capital private equity and commodity funds 
in seeking to obtain the desired return to fund the pension plan  the investment consultant recommends allocation percentages by asset classes 
these recommendations are reviewed by the internal benefits committee  which then recommends their adoption by the finance committee 
the finance committee has established investment allocation percentages by asset classes as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also have a supplemental executive retirement plan serp that provides additional pension benefits to our executive officers whose benefits under the pension plan are reduced due to the application of section of the internal revenue code of and the deferral of salary under deferred compensation plans 
pension costs including the serp were million in  million for and million for of our pension costs  approximately percent are expensed and percent are capitalized consistent with labor charges 
the costs related to the serp are expensed 
our costs for the pension plan are determined in part by actuarial formulas that are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
the serp is available to all new executive officers 
pension costs are affected by employee demographics including age  compensation and length of service by employees  the amount of cash contributions we make to the pension plan  and the return on pension plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of our pension plan may also affect current and future pension costs 
pension plan costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected return on pension plan assets  discount rate used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs  and assumed rate of increase in employee compensation 
the change in pension plan obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in our consolidated statement of income  but we generally recognize the change in future years over the remaining average service period of pension plan participants 
as such  our costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to pension plan participants 
we have not made any changes to pension plan provisions in  and that have had any significant effect on our recorded pension plan amounts 
we have revised the key assumption of the discount rate in  and such changes had an effect on our pension costs in  and and may affect future years  given the cost recognition approach described above 
however  in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  our assumptions can change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to our future pension costs and funding requirements 
in selecting a discount rate  we consider yield rates for highly rated corporate bond portfolios with maturities similar to that of the expected term of pension benefits 
in  we decreased the pension plan discount rate exclusive of the serp to percent from percent in we used a discount rate of percent in this increased the projected benefit obligation exclusive of the serp by approximately million in and million in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by our plan 
we used an expected long term rate of return of percent in  percent in and percent in this increased pension costs by approximately million in and by approximately million in the actual return on plan assets  net of fees  was a gain of million or percent for  a gain of million or percent for and a gain of million or percent for we periodically analyze the estimated long term rate of return on assets based upon updated economic forecasts and revisions to the investment portfolio 

table of contents avista corporation the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage dollars in thousands actuarial assumption change in assumption effect on projected benefit obligation effect on pension cost expected long term return on plan assets expected long term return on plan assets discount rate discount rate changes in the expected return on plan assets would not have an effect on our total pension liability 
we provide certain health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of our retired employees 
we accrue the estimated cost of postretirement benefit obligations during the years that employees provide service 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for our postretirement plans 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would increase our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate for each year would decrease our accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december  by million and the service and interest cost by million 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a discounted cash flow model on at least an annual basis or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
examples of impairment indicators include a deterioration in general economic conditions  market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the entity operates  a decline in market dependent multiples or metrics  increases in costs  overall financial performance such as a decline in earnings or cash flows  or a loss of key customers 
the annual evaluation of goodwill for potential impairment is completed as of december for ecova and as of november for our other businesses 
as of december   we had goodwill of million related to ecova and million related to our other businesses 
our goodwill at ecova has increased significantly in and with the acquisitions of prenova and lpb 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment and the use of significant estimates  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  and the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process performed at the reporting unit level 
the first step involves comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value  the goodwill impairment test is complete and no impairment is recorded 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the second step of the test is performed to determine the amount of impairment loss  if any 
this would result in a full valuation of the reporting units assets and liabilities and comparing the valuation to its carrying amounts  with the aggregate difference indicating the amount of impairment 
in  and  each reporting unit that has been evaluated for impairment has passed the first step of the test  and no impairment losses have been recorded 
contingencies we have unresolved regulatory  legal and tax issues for which there is inherent uncertainty for the ultimate outcome of the respective matter 
we accrue a loss contingency if it is probable that an asset is impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss or impairment can be reasonably estimated 
we also disclose losses that do not meet these conditions for accrual  if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred 
for all material contingencies  we have made a judgment as to the probability of a loss occurring and as to whether or not the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss recognition criteria are met  liabilities are accrued or assets are reduced 
however  no assurance can be given to the ultimate outcome of any particular contingency 
liquidity and capital resources review of cash flow statement overall during  positive cash flows from operating activities of million  proceeds from the issuance of long term debt of million  million of borrowings under ecova committed line of credit  and the issuance of million net of issuance costs of common stock were used to fund the majority of our cash requirements

borrowings on ecova committed line of credit increased million and these proceeds were used to fund the acquisition of prenova 
we issued million of common stock during we cash settled interest rate swap agreements for million related to the pricing of million of long term debt issued in december customer fund obligations at ecova increased million 
overall liquidity our consolidated operating cash flows are primarily derived from the operations of avista utilities 
the primary source of operating cash flows for our utility operations is revenues from sales of electricity and natural gas 
significant uses of cash flows from our utility operations include the purchase of power  fuel and natural gas  and payment of other operating expenses  taxes and interest  with any excess being available for other corporate uses such as capital expenditures and dividends 
we design operating and capital budgets to control operating costs and to direct capital expenditures to choices that support immediate and long term strategies  particularly for our regulated utility operations 
in addition to operating expenses  we have continuing commitments for capital expenditures for construction  improvement and maintenance of utility facilities 
our annual net cash flows from operating activities usually does not fully support the amount required for annual utility capital expenditures 
as such  from time to time  we need to access long term capital markets in order to fund these needs as well as fund maturing debt 
see further discussion at capital resources 
we periodically file for rate adjustments for recovery of operating costs and capital investments to provide the opportunity to improve our earned returns as allowed by regulators 
see further details in the section avista utilities regulatory matters 
for our utility operations  when power and natural gas costs exceed the levels currently recovered from retail customers  net cash flows are negatively affected 
factors that could cause purchased power and natural gas costs to exceed the levels currently recovered from our customers include  but are not limited to  higher prices in wholesale markets when we buy energy or an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets 
factors beyond our control that could result in an increased need to purchase power in the wholesale markets include  but are not limited to 
table of contents avista corporation increases in demand due to either weather or customer growth  low availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  unplanned outages at generating facilities  and failure of third parties to deliver on energy or capacity contracts 
we monitor the potential liquidity impacts of changes to energy commodity prices and other increased operating costs for our utility operations 
we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet such potential needs through our million committed line of credit 
as of december   we had million of available liquidity under our committed line of credit 
with our million credit facility that expires in february  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for the next months 
our utility has regulatory mechanisms in place that provide for the deferral and recovery of the majority of power and natural gas supply costs 
however  if prices rise above the level currently allowed in retail rates in periods when we are buying energy  deferral balances would increase  negatively affecting our cash flow and liquidity until such time as these costs  with interest  are recovered from customers 
collateral requirements our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities can require collateral in the form of cash or letters of credit 
as of december   we had cash deposited as collateral of million and letters of credit of million outstanding related to our energy derivative contracts 
price movements and or a downgrade in our credit ratings could impact further the amount of collateral required 
see credit ratings for further information 
for example  in addition to limiting our ability to conduct transactions  if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade based on our positions outstanding at december   we would potentially be required to post additional collateral of up to million 
this amount is different from the amount disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements because  while this analysis includes contracts that are not considered derivatives in addition to the contracts considered in note  this analysis takes into account contractual threshold limits that are not considered in note without contractual threshold limits  we would potentially be required to post additional collateral of million 
under the terms of interest rate swap agreements that we enter into periodically  we may be required to post cash or letters of credit as collateral depending on fluctuations in the fair value of the instrument 
this has not historically been significant to our liquidity position 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount totaling million and we did not have any collateral posted 
if our credit ratings were lowered to below investment grade based on our interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   we would not be required to post additional collateral 
dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act dodd frank act was enacted into law in july the dodd frank act establishes regulatory jurisdiction by the commodity futures trading commission cftc and the securities and exchange commission sec for certain swaps which include a variety of derivative instruments and certain users of such swaps that previously had been largely exempted from regulation 
a variety of rules must be adopted by federal agencies including the cftc  sec and the ferc to implement the dodd frank act 
these rules being developed and implemented will clarify the impact of the dodd frank act on avista corp  which may be significant 
under the dodd frank act  swap dealers and major swap participants generally will be required to collect minimum initial and variation margin from their counterparties for non cleared swaps 
however  the requirement varies with the type of counterparty and the regulator of the major swap participant or swap dealer 
avista corp 
should be categorized as a counterparty that is a non financial end user for the purposes of the dodd frank act  ie  as a non financial entity that engages in derivatives to hedge commercial risk 
in april  the sec and the cftc issued a joint final rule with respect to security based swap dealers or security based major swap participants 
based on the proposed definitions and the de minimis rule  we believe that avista corp 
is unlikely to be classified as a security based swap dealer or security based major swap participant 
the dodd frank act also requires certain swaps to be cleared and traded on exchanges or swap execution facilities 
such clearing requirements could result in a change from our current practice of bilaterally negotiated credit terms 
an exemption from mandatory clearing is available under the dodd frank act for counterparties that are non financial end users using swaps to hedge commercial risk 
in july  the cftc issued a final rule providing for an exemption from clearing requirements as outlined in dodd frank for end users that enter into hedges to mitigate commercial risk 
we expect most of our transactions to qualify under the end 
table of contents avista corporation user exemption  however we may choose to use a clearing agent for many transactions even if we are allowed bilateral transactions 
during  the board of directors of avista corp 
approved the use of the end user exemption  if we choose to utilize this exemption 
we will continue to monitor developments regarding implementation steps defined in the dodd frank act 
we cannot predict the impact the dodd frank act may ultimately have on our operations 
capital resources our consolidated capital structure  including the current portion of long term debt and short term borrowings  and excluding noncontrolling interests  consisted of the following as of december  and dollars in thousands december  december  amount percent of total amount percent of total current portion of long term debt current portion of nonrecourse long term debt spokane energy short term borrowings long term borrowings under committed line of credit long term debt to affiliated trusts nonrecourse long term debt spokane energy long term debt total debt total avista corporation stockholders equity total we need to finance capital expenditures and acquire additional funds for operations from time to time 
the cash requirements needed to service our indebtedness  both short term and long term  reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund capital expenditures  purchased power  fuel and natural gas costs  dividends and other requirements 
our stockholders equity increased million during primarily due to net income  the issuance of common stock  and the expiration of the subsidiary noncontrolling interests redemption rights  partially offset by dividends 
we generally fund capital expenditures with a combination of internally generated cash and external financing 
the level of cash generated internally and the amount that is available for capital expenditures fluctuates depending on a variety of factors 
cash provided by our utility operating activities  as well as issuances of long term debt and common stock  are expected to be the primary source of funds for operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures for borrowings under our million committed line of credit will supplement these funds to the extent necessary 
in august  we entered into two sales agency agreements under which we may sell up to million shares of our common stock from time to time 
in  we sold million shares for a total of million net of issuance costs 
as of december   we had million shares available to be issued under these agreements 
we are planning to issue up to million of common stock in in order to maintain our capital structure at an appropriate level for our business 
in  we issued million net of issuance costs of common stock 
the additional shares were issued under sales agency agreements  as well as the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan and employee plans 
in november  we issued million of percent first mortgage bonds due in the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our million committed line of credit 
in connection with the pricing of the first mortgage bonds  we cash settled interest rate swap contracts and paid a total of million  which will be amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the debt 
there are million in first mortgage bonds maturing in and we expect to issue up to million of long term debt during the second half of we have a committed line of credit with various financial institutions in the total amount of million with an expiration date of february borrowings under this line of credit agreement are classified as short term on the consolidated balance sheets 
this facility contains customary covenants and default provisions  including a covenant which does not permit our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated total capitalization to be greater than percent at any time 
as of december  
table of contents avista corporation  we were in compliance with this covenant with a ratio of percent 
balances outstanding and interest rates of borrowings excluding letters of credit under our committed line of credit were as follows as of and for the year ended december dollars in thousands balance outstanding at end of year letters of credit outstanding at end of year maximum balance outstanding during the year average balance outstanding during the year average interest rate during the year average interest rate at end of year the decrease in the average balance outstanding was due in part to a new intercompany borrowing arrangement between avista corp 
and ecova 
as part of their cash management practices and operations  ecova and avista corp 
entered into an arrangement in january under which avista corp 
issued to ecova a master unsecured promissory note and ecova will from time to time make short term loans to avista corp 
as a temporary investment of its funds received from its clients 
the master promissory note limits the total outstanding indebtedness to no more than million in principal 
additionally  such loans are required to be repaid on the last business day of each quarter march  june  september and december and sooner upon demand by ecova 
amounts are loaned at a rate consistent with avista corp 
s credit facility 
the average balance outstanding was million and the maximum balance was million during any default on the line of credit or other financing arrangements of avista corp 
or any of our significant subsidiaries  if any  could result in cross defaults to other agreements of such entity  and or to the line of credit or other financing arrangements of any other of such entities 
any defaults could also induce vendors and other counterparties to demand collateral 
in the event of any such default  it would be difficult for us to obtain financing on reasonable terms to pay creditors or fund operations 
we would also likely be prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock 
avista corp 
does not guarantee the indebtedness of any of its subsidiaries 
as of december   avista corp 
and its subsidiaries were in compliance with all of the covenants of their financing agreements  and none of avista corp 
s subsidiaries constituted a significant subsidiary as defined in avista corp 
s committed line of credit 
ecova also has a committed line of credit agreement with various financial institutions for million with an expiration date of july this credit agreement is used primarily to fund acquisitions at ecova and supplement cash flow for ecova operations when necessary and is generally not available for capital acquisitions 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under ecova s credit agreement as of december  classified as long term 
see the ecova credit agreement section below for further discussion regarding this agreement 
we are restricted under our restated articles of incorporation  as amended  as to the additional preferred stock we can issue 
as of december   we could issue million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of percent 
we are not planning to issue preferred stock 
under the mortgage and deed of trust securing our first mortgage bonds including secured medium term notes  we may issue additional first mortgage bonds in an aggregate principal amount equal to the sum of percent of the cost or fair value whichever is lower of property additions which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or an equal principal amount of retired first mortgage bonds which have not previously been made the basis of any application under the mortgage  or deposit of cash 
however  we may not issue any additional first mortgage bonds with certain exceptions in the case of bonds issued on the basis of retired bonds unless our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any period of consecutive calendar months out of the preceding calendar months were at least twice the annual interest requirements on all mortgage securities at the time outstanding  including the first mortgage bonds to be issued  and on all indebtedness of prior rank 
as of december   our property additions and retired bonds would have allowed  and the net earnings test would not have prohibited  the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds 
we believe that we have adequate capacity to issue first mortgage bonds to meet our financing needs over the next several years 

table of contents avista corporation avista utilities capital expenditures capital expenditures for our utility were million for the years through we expect utility capital expenditures to be about million for each of  and our capital budget for includes the following dollars in millions transmission and distribution upgrade current facilities information technology customer growth incremental transmission and distribution generation natural gas facilities environmental other total most of the capital expenditures above are for upgrading and maintenance of our existing facilities  and not for construction of new facilities and we expect all of these capital expenditures to be included in rate base in future years 
these estimates of capital expenditures are subject to continuing review and adjustment 
actual capital expenditures may vary from our estimates due to factors such as changes in business conditions  construction schedules and environmental requirements 
future generation resource decisions may be further impacted by legislation for restrictions on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and renewable energy requirements as discussed at environmental issues and other contingencies 
included in our estimates of capital expenditures is the replacement of our customer information and work management systems  which is expected to be completed by the end of our customer information system and work management systems are two of our most critical technology systems and are interconnected to every other system in our company 
we expect to spend a total of approximately million including internal labor over the term of the project 
major signed contracts for third parties total approximately million as of december  ecova credit agreement in july  ecova entered into a million committed line of credit agreement with various financial institutions that replaced its million committed line of credit agreement and has an expiration date of july the credit agreement is secured by all of ecova assets excluding investments and funds held for clients 
there were million of borrowings outstanding under ecova s credit agreement as of december  classified as long term 
the proceeds from these borrowings were used to fund the acquisitions of prenova in november and lpb in january the committed line of credit agreement contains customary covenants and default provisions  including a covenant which requires that ecova consolidated total funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement must be to or less  with provisions in the credit agreement allowing for a temporary increase of this ratio if a qualified acquisition is consummated by ecova 
in addition  ecova consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement must be greater than to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
as of december   ecova was in compliance with these covenants and based on the consolidated total funded debt to ebitda ratio  ecova could borrow an additional million and still be compliant with the covenants 
the covenant restrictions are calculated on a rolling twelve month basis  so this additional borrowing capacity could increase or decrease or ecova could be required to pay down the outstanding debt as future results change 
we expect ecova earnings to increase in the future  so we expect the excess borrowing capacity to increase as well 
ecova redeemable stock ecova amended employee stock incentive plan provides an annual window at which time holders of common stock can put their shares back to ecova  providing the shares are held for a minimum of six months 
stock is reacquired at fair market value at the date of reacquisition 
as the repurchase feature is at the discretion of the minority shareholders and option holders  there were redeemable noncontrolling interests of million as of december  for the intrinsic value of stock options outstanding  as well as outstanding redeemable stock 
in  the ecova employee stock incentive plan was amended such that  on a prospective basis  not all options granted under the plan have the put right 
additionally  there were redeemable noncontrolling interests related to the cadence network acquisition  as the previous owners could have exercised a right to put their stock back to ecova in july or july if their investment in ecova was not liquidated through either an 
table of contents avista corporation initial public offering or sale of the business to a third party 
these redemption rights were not exercised  expired effective july  and were reclassified to permanent equity 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under our million committed line of credit  compared to million as of december  pension plan as of december   our pension plan had assets with a fair value that was less than the benefit obligation under the plan 
the pension plan funding deficit as measured under asc increased in primarily due to a decrease in the discount rate 
in  the moving ahead for progress in the st century map federal legislation was approved that changed how the required discount rate was calculated for funding purposes  impacting the minimum required contributions as determined by erisa federal regulations and the internal revenue code 
the change in law required the discount rate for the target liability to be calculated over a year average versus the previously required year average 
although the legislation was not passed until late  the change in discount rate was retroactively effective to january  this significantly increased the discount rate resulting in a lower target liability 
the funded status  as determined by erisa federal regulations and the internal revenue code  for our plan increased from approximately percent to percent without any other changes as of january  we contributed million to the pension plan in we expect to contribute a total of million to the pension plan in the period through  with contributions of million per year for the period to and a contribution of million in our contribution is expected to decrease in as we move toward fully funded status 
the final determination of pension plan contributions for future periods is subject to multiple variables  most of which are beyond our control  including further changes to the fair value of pension plan assets  changes in actuarial assumptions in particular the discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation  or changes in federal legislation 
we may change our pension plan contributions in the future depending on changes to any of the above variables 
credit ratings our access to capital markets and our cost of capital are directly affected by our credit ratings 
in addition  many of our contracts for the purchase and sale of energy commodities contain terms dependent upon our credit ratings 
see collateral requirements and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our credit ratings as of february  standard poor s moody s corporate issuer rating bbb baa senior secured debt a a senior unsecured debt bbb baa standard poor s lowest investment grade credit rating is bbb 
moody s lowest investment grade credit rating is baa a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities 
each security rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization 
each security rating agency has its own methodology for assigning ratings  and  accordingly  each rating should be considered in the context of the applicable methodology  independent of all other ratings 
the rating agencies provide ratings at the request of avista corp 
and charge fees for their services 
dividends the board of directors considers the level of dividends on our common stock on a regular basis  taking into account numerous factors including  without limitation our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition  the success of our business strategies  and general economic and competitive conditions 
our net income available for dividends is primarily derived from our regulated utility operations 
the payment of dividends on common stock is restricted by provisions of certain covenants applicable to preferred stock when outstanding contained in our restated articles of incorporation  as amended 

table of contents avista corporation on february   avista corp 
s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share on the company s common stock 
this was an increase of per share  or percent from the previous quarterly dividend of per share 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of our future contractual obligations as of december  dollars in millions thereafter avista utilities long term debt maturities long term debt to affiliated trusts interest payments on long term debt short term borrowings energy purchase contracts public utility district contracts operating lease obligations other obligations information technology contracts pension plan funding spokane energy nonrecourse long term debt maturities interest payments on nonrecourse long term debt avista capital consolidated redeemable noncontrolling interests long term borrowings under committed line of credit interest payments on long term borrowings under committed line of credit venture funds investments operating lease obligations client fund obligations total contractual obligations represents our estimate of interest payments on long term debt  which is calculated based on the assumption that all debt is outstanding until maturity 
interest on variable rate debt is calculated using the rate in effect at december  energy purchase contracts were entered into as part of the obligation to serve our retail electric and natural gas customers energy requirements 
as a result  costs are generally recovered either through base retail rates or adjustments to retail rates as part of the power and natural gas cost adjustment mechanisms 
includes the interest component of the lease obligation 
future capital lease obligations are not material 
represents operational agreements  settlements and other contractual obligations for our generation  transmission and distribution facilities 
these costs are generally recovered through base retail rates

certain shares acquired under ecova s employee stock incentive plan are redeemable at the option of the shareholder 
represents a commitment to fund a limited partnership venture fund commitment made by a subsidiary of avista capital 
includes information service contracts which are recorded to other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income as well as information technology contracts associated with the replacement of our customer information and work management systems  which are capital expenditures and expected to be completed in the above contractual obligations do not include income tax payments 
also  asset retirement obligations are not included above and payments associated with these have historically been less than million per year 
there are approximately million remaining asset retirement obligations as of december  
table of contents avista corporation in addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above  we will incur additional operating costs and capital expenditures in future periods for which we are not contractually obligated as part of our normal business operations 
competition our utility electric and natural gas distribution business has historically been recognized as a natural monopoly 
in each regulatory jurisdiction  our rates for retail electric and natural gas services other than specially negotiated retail rates for industrial or large commercial customers  which are subject to regulatory review and approval are determined on a cost of service basis 
rates are designed to provide  after recovery of allowable operating expenses and capital investments  an opportunity for us to earn a reasonable return on investment as allowed by our regulators 
in retail markets  we compete with various rural electric cooperatives and public utility districts in and adjacent to our service territories in the provision of service to new electric customers 
alternative methods of generation  including solar and other self generation  may also compete with us for sales to existing customers 
similarly  our natural gas distribution operations compete with other energy sources including heating oil  propane and other fuels 
certain natural gas customers could by pass our natural gas system  reducing both revenues and recovery of fixed costs 
to reduce the potential for such by pass  we price natural gas services  including transportation contracts  competitively and have varying degrees of flexibility to price transportation and delivery rates by means of individual contracts 
these individual contracts are subject to state regulatory review and approval 
we have long term transportation contracts with several of our largest industrial customers under which the customer acquires its own commodity while using our infrastructure for delivery 
such contracts reduce the risk of these customers by passing our system in the foreseeable future and minimizes the impact on our earnings 
also  non utility businesses are developing new technologies and services to help energy consumers manage energy in new ways that may improve productivity and could alter demand for the energy we sell 
in wholesale markets  competition for available electric supply is influenced by the localized and system wide demand for energy  type  capacity  location and availability of generation resources  and variety and circumstances of market participants 
these wholesale markets are regulated by the ferc  which requires electric utilities to transmit power and energy to or for wholesale purchasers and sellers  enlarge or construct additional transmission capacity for the purpose of providing these services  and transparently price and offer transmission services without favor to any party  including the merchant functions of the utility 
participants in the wholesale energy markets include other utilities  federal power marketing agencies  energy marketing and trading companies  independent power producers  financial institutions  and commodity brokers 
ecova is subject to competition for service to existing customers and as they develop products and services and enter new markets 
competition from other companies may mean challenges for ecova to be the first to market a new product or service to gain an advantage in market share 
in addition  ecova services utilize rapidly advancing technologies which require continual product enhancement to avoid obsolescence 
economic conditions and utility load growth the general economic data  on both national and local levels  contained in this section is based  in part  on independent government and industry publications  reports by market research firms or other independent sources 
while we believe that 
table of contents avista corporation these publications and other sources are reliable  we have not independently verified such data and can make no representation as to its accuracy 
we track multiple economic indicators affecting three distinct metropolitan areas in our service area spokane  washington  coeur d alene  idaho  and medford  oregon 
several key indicators are employment change  unemployment rates and foreclosure rates 
on a year over year basis  december showed positive job growth  and lower unemployment rates in all three metropolitan areas 
foreclosure rates are in line with or below the u 
s rate in all three areas 
however  the unemployment rates are still above the national average and two key leading indicators  initial unemployment claims and residential building permits  continue to signal modest growth over the next months 
therefore  in  we continue to expect economic growth in our service area to be somewhat slower than the us as a whole 
seasonally adjusted nonfarm employment in our eastern washington  northern idaho  and southwestern oregon metropolitan service areas exhibited moderate growth between december and december in spokane  washington employment growth was percent with gains in mining  logging  and construction  leisure and hospitality  and business and professional services 
employment increased by percent in coeur d alene  idaho  reflecting gains in construction  professional and business services  financial activities  trade  transport  and utilities  and education and health services 
in medford  oregon  employment growth was percent  with gains in manufacturing  construction  trade  transport  and utilities  leisure and hospitality  and financial activities 
us nonfarm sector jobs grew by percent in the same twelve month period 
seasonally adjusted unemployment rates went down in december from the year earlier in spokane  coeur d alene  and medford 
in spokane the rate was percent in december and declined to percent in december  in coeur d alene the rate went from percent to percent  and in medford the rate declined from percent to percent 
the us rate declined from percent to percent in the same period 
the housing market in our service area continues to experience foreclosure rates in line with or lower than the national average 
the december national rate was percent  compared to percent in spokane county  washington  percent in kootenai county coeur d alene  idaho  and percent in jackson county medford  oregon 
based on our forecast for through  we expect annual electric customer growth to average percent to percent per year and annual natural gas customer growth to average percent to percent within our service area 
we anticipate retail electric load growth to average between percent and percent and natural gas load growth to average between percent and percent 
we anticipate customer and load growth at the lower end of the range in and a modest recovery as the economy strengthens during the four year period 
while the number of electric and natural gas customers is growing  the average annual usage by each residential customer has not changed significantly 
growth in electric and natural gas sales has slowed as retail prices have increased and company sponsored conservation programs have intensified 
with a weaker than normal post recession recovery in avista service area  population and business growth in our three state service territory remains at or below the national average 
in addition to the foregoing  electric and natural gas sales vary significantly with annual fluctuations in weather within our service territories 
the forward looking statements set forth above regarding retail load growth are based  in part  upon purchased economic forecasts and publicly available population and demographic studies 
the expectations regarding retail load growth are also based upon various assumptions  including assumptions relating to weather and economic and competitive conditions  internal analysis of company specific data  such as energy consumption patterns  internal business plans  and an assumption that we will incur no material loss of retail customers due to self generation or retail wheeling 
changes in actual experience can vary significantly from our projections 
environmental issues and contingencies we are subject to environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
the generation  transmission  distribution  service and storage facilities in which we have ownership interests are designed and operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws 
furthermore  we conduct periodic reviews and audits of pertinent facilities and operations to ensure compliance and to respond to or anticipate emerging environmental issues 
the company board of directors has established a committee to oversee environmental issues 

table of contents avista corporation we monitor legislative and regulatory developments at all levels of government for environmental issues  particularly those with the potential to impact the operation and productivity of our generating plants and other assets 
environmental laws and regulations may increase the operating costs of generating plants  increase the lead time and capital costs for the construction of new generating plants  require modification of our existing generating plants  require existing generating plant operations to be curtailed or shut down  reduce the amount of energy available from our generating plants  restrict the types of generating plants that can be built or contracted with  and require construction of specific types of generation plants at higher cost 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could result in increases to capital expenditures and operating expenses 
we intend to seek recovery of any such costs through the ratemaking process 
clean air act we must comply with the requirements under the clean air act caa in operating our thermal generating plants 
the caa currently requires a title v operating permit for colstrip steam generation facility colstrip expires in  coyote springs renewal expected in  the kettle falls generation station gs renewal expected in  and the rathdrum combustion turbine ct expires in 
boulder park gs  northeast ct  and other activities only require minor source operating or registration permits based on their limited operation and emissions 
the title v operating permits are renewed every five years and updated to include all newly applicable caa requirements 
we actively monitor legislative  regulatory and program developments within the caa that may impact our facilities 
on july   we received a notice of intent to sue for violations of the clean air act at colstrip steam electric station notice from counsel on behalf of the sierra club and the montana environmental information center meic 
an amended notice was received on september   and supplemental notices were received in october and december we are evaluating the allegations set forth in the notices and cannot at this time predict the outcome of this matter 
see sierra club and montana environmental information center notice in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on this matter 
hazardous air pollutants haps the epa regulates hazardous air pollutants from a published list of industrial sources referred to as source categories which must meet control technology requirements if they emit one or more of the pollutants in significant quantities 
in  the epa finalized the mercury air toxic standards mats for the coal and oil fired source category 
for colstrip units  the only units in which we are a minority owner  the existing emission control systems should be sufficient to meet mercury limits 
for the remaining portion of the rule that specifically addresses air toxics including metals and acid gases  the colstrip owners are currently evaluating what type of new emission control systems may be needed for mats compliance in we continue to monitor  but are unable to determine to what extent or if there will be any material impacts to colstrip at this time 
regional haze program the epa set a national goal of eliminating man made visibility degradation in class i areas by the year states are expected to take actions to make reasonable progress through year plans  including application of best available retrofit technology bart requirements 
bart is a retrofit program applied to large emission sources  including electric generating units built between and in the case where a state opts out of implementing the regional haze program  the epa may act directly 
on september   the epa finalized the regional haze federal implementation plan fip for montana 
the fip includes both emission limitations and pollution controls for colstrip units colstrip units  the only units of which we are a minority owner  are not currently affected  but will be evaluated for reasonable progress at the next review period in september we do not anticipate any material impacts on units at this time 
in november  the national parks conservation association  meic and sierra club filed a petition for review of epa montana fip in the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
we continue to monitor  but we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
climate change concerns about long term global climate changes could have a significant effect on our business 
our operations could also be affected by changes in laws and regulations intended to mitigate the risk of or alter global climate changes  including 
table of contents avista corporation restrictions on the operation of our power generation resources and obligations imposed on the sale of natural gas 
changing temperatures and precipitation  including snowpack conditions  affect the availability and timing of streamflows  which impact hydroelectric generation 
extreme weather events could increase service interruptions  outages and maintenance costs 
changing temperatures could also increase or decrease customer demand 
our climate policy council an interdisciplinary team of management and other employees facilitates internal and external communications regarding climate change issues  analyzes policy impacts  anticipates opportunities and evaluates strategies for avista corp  and develops recommendations on climate related policy positions and action plans 
federal legislation the us congress has considered many proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mandate renewable or clean energy 
the financial and operational impacts of climate or energy legislation  if enacted  would depend on a variety of factors  including the specific provisions and timing of any legislation that might ultimately be adopted 
federal legislative proposals that would impose mandatory requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions  renewable or clean energy standards  and or energy efficiency standards are expected to continue to be considered by the us congress 
federal regulatory actions the us supreme court ruled in that the epa had authority under the caa to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles  subsequently  the epa issued regulations on tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases ghg 
when these regulations became effective  ghg became regulated pollutants under the prevention of significant deterioration psd preconstruction permit program and the title v operating permit program  which both apply to power plants and other commercial and industrial facilities 
in  the epa issued a final rule  known as the tailoring rule  governing how these programs would be applied to stationary sources  including power plants 
the epa proposed a rule in early setting performance standards for ghg emissions from new and modified fossil fuel fired electric generating units and announced plans to issue ghg emissions guidelines for existing sources 
the rule for new sources has not been finalized  and no rule for existing sources has yet been proposed 
ghg emission standards could result in significant compliance costs 
such standards could also preclude us from developing  operating or contracting with certain types of generating plants 
our thermal generation facilities may be impacted by the promulgated psd permitting rules in the future 
these rules can impact the time to obtain permits for new generation and major modifications to existing generating units and the final permit limitations 
the promulgated and proposed ghg rulemakings mentioned above also have been legally challenged in multiple venues  so we cannot fully anticipate the outcome or extent our facilities may be impacted by these regulations at this time 
epa mandatory reporting rule mrr any facility emitting over  metric tons of ghgs per year must report its emissions 
we currently report under this requirement for colstrip  coyote springs  and rathdrum ct 
mrr also requires ghg reporting for natural gas distribution system throughput  fugitive emissions from electric power transmission and distribution systems  fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution systems  and from natural gas storage facilities 
we reported the applicable ghg emissions in state legislation and state regulatory activities the states of washington and oregon have adopted non binding targets to reduce ghg emissions 
both states enacted their targets with an expectation of reaching the targets through a combination of renewable energy standards  and assorted complementary policies  but no specific reductions are mandated 
washington state department of ecology has adopted regulations to update its state implementation plan relative to epa regulation of ghg emissions 
we will continue to monitor actions by the department as it may proceed to adopt additional regulations under its caa authorities  and cannot predict any material impact at this time 
washington and oregon apply a ghg emissions performance standard eps to electric generation facilities used to serve retail loads in their jurisdictions 
the eps prevents utilities from constructing or purchasing generation facilities  or entering into power purchase agreements of five years or longer duration  to purchase energy produced by plants that have emission levels higher than  pounds of ghg per mwh 
the washington state department of commerce commerce initiated a process to adopt a lower emissions performance standard in  any new standard will be applicable until at least commerce published a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking on january  with a new eps of 
table of contents avista corporation pounds of ghg per mwh 
we will continue to monitor this rulemaking  and cannot predict any material impact at this time 
initiative measure i  the energy independence act  became law in washington general election 
i requires electric utilities with over  customers to acquire qualified renewable energy resources and or renewable energy credits equal to percent of the utility total retail load in i also requires these utilities to meet biennial energy conservation targets beginning in furthermore  by january   electric utilities subject to i s mandates must acquire enough qualified renewable energy and or renewable energy credits to meet three percent of their retail load 
this renewable energy standard increases to nine percent in failure to comply with renewable energy and efficiency standards could result in penalties of per mwh or greater assessed against a utility for each mwh it is deficient in meeting a standard 
we have met  and will continue to meet  the requirements of i through a variety of renewable energy generating means  including  but not limited to  some combination of hydro upgrades  wind and biomass 
in  i was amended in such a way that our kettle falls generating station and certain other biomass energy facilities which commenced operation before march   are considered resources that may be used to meet the renewable energy standards beginning in coal ash management disposal currently  coal combustion byproducts ccbs are not regulated by the epa as a hazardous waste 
under a proposed rule issued in  the epa is reconsidering the classification of ccbs under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra 
the draft rules included two options to require management of ccbs as a hazardous waste under subtitle c of the rcra  or to regulate coal ash under subtitle d  for non hazardous solid wastes  with possible special waste requirements 
should the epa determine to regulate ccbs as a hazardous waste under rcra  such action could significantly impact future operations of colstrip 
congress has also considered proposed legislation regarding ccb management 
we cannot predict the impact of future ccb regulation 
if we were to incur incremental costs as a result of new ccb regulations  we would seek recovery in customer rates 
threatened and endangered species and wildlife a number of species of fish in the northwest are listed as threatened or endangered under the federal endangered species act 
efforts to protect these and other species have not directly impacted generation levels at any of our hydroelectric facilities 
we are implementing fish protection measures at its hydroelectric project on the clark fork river under a year ferc operating license for cabinet gorge and noxon rapids issued march that incorporates a comprehensive settlement agreement 
the restoration of native salmonid fish  including bull trout  is a key part of the agreement 
the result is a collaborative native salmonid restoration program with the us fish and wildlife service  native american tribes and the states of idaho and montana on the lower clark fork river  consistent with requirements of the ferc license 
the us fish wildlife service issued an updated critical habitat designation for bull trout in that includes the lower clark fork river  as well as portions of the coeur d alene basin within our spokane river project area  and is currently developing a final bull trout recovery plan under the esa 
issues related to these activities are expected to be resolved through the ongoing collaborative effort of our clark fork and spokane river ferc licenses 
see spokane river licensing and fish passage at cabinet gorge and noxon rapids in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
various statutory authorities  including the migratory bird treaty act  have established penalties for the unauthorized take of migratory birds 
because we operate facilities that can pose risks to a variety of such birds  we have developed and follow an avian protection plan

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposures are commodity prices for electric power and natural gas credit related to the wholesale energy market interest rates on long term and short term debt foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the canadian dollar 
table of contents avista corporation commodity price risk electric power commodities we are exposed to market risks for electric power because of imbalances between available power supply resources and our load obligations  substitution of resources to achieve economic dispatch from available power supply choices  and our objective to optimize the value of specific power resource facilities 
imbalances between available power supply resources and our electric load obligations arise because of seasonal factors  operating parameters of our facilities  contract rights and contract obligations  and variations in customer demand 
we forecast both obligations and resources to estimate our future surplus or deficit positions 
we hedge a portion of the open position with forward transactions that establish physical supply or disposition and or financially equivalent derivatives that mitigate economic uncertainty 
seasonal factors and prevailing weather affect power supplies 
supply is affected by both temperature and the timing and amount of precipitation  particularly with respect to our hydroelectric generation facilities that rely on river flows from immediate precipitation and from melting snow 
wind conditions affect the amount and timing of supply from wind generation facilities 
operational parameters affecting power resources include natural river flow  water storage and regulation driven constraints for hydroelectric generation 
operational parameters also include maintenance requirements and forced outages at electric generating plants  fuel availability for thermal plants  environmental and other regulatory constraints and other factors 
electric power obligations include retail customer demand and other commitments between avista corp 
and other parties in the wholesale power market 
retail customer demand is sensitive to temperature and to normal seasonal temperature variation that impacts customers heating and cooling related demand for energy 
obligations are also affected by customer growth  economic conditions  technology that adds to or reduces electric demand  and choices that customers make about energy usage 
our forecasts of obligations consider contract terms  past energy demand patterns and indicators of potential changes in energy consumption 
economic dispatch involves the decisions that we make in the mix of power resources to meet our retail customer requirements and other obligations 
we make dispatch decisions to operate or not operate our resources and to dispose of energy or to obtain resources from others in the wholesale power market including natural gas fuel markets 
hydroelectric generation is typically the lowest cost source of supply 
thermal generation resource costs vary with fuel costs and other factors 
power purchase agreements may provide us with variable power supply quantities and contract terms can include both fixed and variable costs 
to balance electric power resources and electric demand obligations  we enter into transactions in the wholesale power and fuel markets 
these transactions include physical power and natural gas and derivative instruments based on wholesale prices of power and natural gas 
wholesale market prices tend to vary with natural gas fuel costs to the extent that natural gas fired resources are the least cost alternative in the region which is often the case in recent years 
wholesale prices also tend to vary with the extent of hydroelectric surplus or shortages  particularly during the highest hydroelectric generation periods of spring rains and snow melt 
wholesale prices also vary based on wind patterns that affect output from wind generation facilities in the region 
requirements for renewable energy resources and tax credit incentives for such resources can impact wholesale prices  including sometimes pushing prices to negative values 
generating resource availability and regional demand tend to impact energy prices 
wholesale prices are quoted for energy to be delivered in time frames ranging from intra hour  hourly  daily  multi day  monthly  quarterly and annually 
future market prices extend several years into the future  though market liquidity tends to become limited beyond a few years into the future 
natural gas commodities we purchase natural gas for delivery to retail natural gas customers 
some natural gas is purchased for injection into storage  which can later be withdrawn from storage 
we also sell natural gas originally purchased for retail natural gas supply or inventory back into the wholesale market 
some of the wholesale natural gas transactions are executed at fixed prices for future delivery  while some are executed based on market index prices or spot prices 
we transact for physical delivery of natural gas and we enter into swaps that create a financial hedge for future natural gas prices 
natural gas is a significant source of fuel for electric generation 
we buy natural gas as fuel for electric generating facilities that we own and for the lancaster plant where we have contractual rights to dispatch its operation 
we also sell natural gas when we have an opportunity to displace thermal generation with other power supply resources or when expected thermal generation does not actually occur for any reason 

table of contents avista corporation we hedge a portion of these natural gas purchases and sales  including the use of physical delivery contracts and derivative instruments based on wholesale prices of natural gas 
we also transact based on index pricing in the wholesale natural gas market and at spot market prices that can vary significantly 
some  but not all  natural gas transactions related to thermal generation are executed concurrently with similar quantities of electric energy based on physical fuel to power conversion parameters of generation facilities that we own or control 
in such cases  the net economic cost or benefit between natural gas purchases and power sales or gas sales offset by power purchases will vary as each commodity price moves independently of the other 
we enter into natural gas transactions intended to extract value from our assets and contract rights 
these asset optimization transactions include purchases and offsetting sales at two delivery locations when we have excess capacity available in natural gas pipelines such pipelines are usually owned by other parties where we have contract rights for that capacity 
asset optimization strategies also include time difference purchases and sales of natural gas that use excess storage capacity available in our underground natural gas storage facilities 
these transactions include commitments for future physical delivery and or financial swaps tied to the price of natural gas 
matters affecting both electric and natural gas commodities variation in electric and natural gas commodity prices affects our cash flow  customer retail rates and the amount of net income we recognize 
regulatory cost recovery mechanisms address these power supply and gas cost variations  such that a portion of the cost variation is passed on to customers and a portion is recognized by the company 
the timing of incurring costs can be significantly different than the timing for recovering costs  resulting in the need for a significant liquidity cushion 
historically  we have carried significant balances of deferred power supply and natural gas supply costs  which represent costs we expect to recover from customers in future retail rates  subject to approval by regulators 
when we have surplus electric generation  its value varies with market prices and economics of other resources in the region 
when we have a shortage of electric generation from our own resources and other resources that we have long term rights to control  the cost to obtain electric power or fuel varies 
we make forecasts to estimate surplus and deficit conditions and we may enter into forward hedging arrangements to reduce the expected net surplus or deficit 
our forecasts cannot avoid uncertainty about loads or obligations and we do not attempt to fully hedge all forecast net open positions 
our hedges include forward transactions ranging from intra hour to multiple years in the future  with transaction blocks of intra hour  hourly  daily  monthly  quarterly  annually  and multiple years 
see further information at avista utilities regulatory matters 
see risk management for energy resources for additional information on our activities to hedge our exposure to price risk by making forward commitments for energy purchases and sales 
wholesale electricity prices are affected by a number of factors  including demand for electricity  adequacy of generating reserve margins  scheduled and unscheduled outages of generating facilities  availability of streamflows for hydroelectric generation  price and availability of fuel for thermal generating plants  disruptions to or constraints on transmission facilities  the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade  and weather including temperature fluctuations and generation resulting from wind 
wholesale natural gas prices are affected by a number of factors  including demand for natural gas  including natural gas as fuel for electric generation  actual and expected changes in the north american natural gas supply volume or source mix including the growth in unconventional supplies such as natural gas from shale  natural gas production that can be delivered to our service areas  level of imports and exports  particularly from canada by pipeline  and any taxes or restrictions that apply  potential development of liquefied natural gas export facilities that compete for supplies  
table of contents avista corporation level of storage inventories and regional accessibility  global energy markets  including oil or other natural gas substitutes  such as coal  availability of pipeline capacity to transport natural gas from region to region  and the number of market participants and the willingness of market participants to trade 
any combination of these factors that reduces the supply of or increases demand for energy generally causes the market price to move upward 
conversely  factors that reduce demand or increase production will generally reduce market prices for energy 
in addition to these factors  wholesale power markets are subject to regulatory constraints including price controls 
price risk relates to physical energy products and to fluctuation in market prices of associated derivative commodity instruments such as swaps  options and forward contracts 
price risk may be influenced to the extent that the performance or non performance by market participants of their contractual obligations and commitments affect the supply of  or demand for  the commodity 
substantially all forward contracts to purchase or sell power and natural gas are recorded as derivative assets or liabilities at estimated fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability 
contracts that are not considered derivatives are generally accounted for on the accrual basis until they are settled or realized  unless there is a decline in the fair value of the contract that is determined to be other than temporary 
the following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values as a net asset or liability as of december  that are expected to settle in each respective year dollars in thousands purchases sales electric derivatives gas derivatives electric derivatives gas derivatives year physical financial physical financial physical financial physical financial thereafter the following table presents energy commodity derivative fair values as a net asset or liability as of december  that are expected to settle in each respective year dollars in thousands purchases sales electric derivatives gas derivatives electric derivatives gas derivatives year physical financial physical financial physical financial physical financial thereafter physical transactions represent commodity transactions where we will take delivery of either electricity or natural gas and financial transactions represent derivative instruments with no physical delivery  such as futures  swaps  options  or forward contracts 
the above electric and natural gas derivative contracts will be included in either power supply costs or natural gas supply costs during the period they settle and will be included in the various recovery mechanisms erm  pca  and pgas  or in the general rate case process  and are expected to eventually be collected through retail rates from customers 

table of contents avista corporation credit risk counterparty non performance risk credit risk relates to potential losses that we would incur as a result of non performance of contractual obligations by counterparties to deliver energy or make financial settlements 
we often extend credit to counterparties and customers  and we are exposed to the risk of not being able to collect amounts owed to us 
credit risk includes potential counterparty default due to circumstances relating directly to the counterparty  caused by market price changes  and relating to other market participants that have a direct or indirect relationship with such counterparty 
changes in market prices may dramatically alter the size of credit risk with counterparties  even when we establish conservative credit limits 
should a counterparty fail to perform  we may be required to honor the underlying commitment or to replace existing contracts with contracts at then current market prices 
we enter into bilateral transactions with various counterparties 
we also trade energy and related derivative instruments through clearinghouse exchanges 
we seek to mitigate bilateral credit risk by entering into bilateral contracts that specify credit terms and protections against default  applying credit limits and duration criteria to existing and prospective counterparties  actively monitoring current credit exposures  asserting our collateral rights with counterparties  and carrying out transaction settlements timely and effectively 
we also mitigate credit risk by transacting through exchanges that use fully collateralized clearing arrangements to significantly reduce counterparty default risk 
the extent of transactions conducted through exchanges has increased as many market participants have shown a preference toward exchange trading and have reduced bilateral transactions 
we actively monitor the collateral required by such exchanges to effectively manage our capital requirements 
our credit policy and processes include an evaluation of the financial condition and credit ratings of counterparties  collateral requirements or other credit enhancements  such as letters of credit or parent company guarantees 
we use both tailored and standardized agreements as we negotiate contract terms with counterparties 
such contract terms often allow for the netting or offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty or affiliated group 
despite mitigation efforts  the risk of counterparty default or excessive collateral demands on us cannot be entirely eliminated 
credit risk may be affected by industry concentration and geographic concentration 
we have concentrations of suppliers and customers in the electric and natural gas industries including electric and natural gas utilities  electric generators and transmission providers  natural gas producers and pipelines  financial institutions including commodity clearing exchanges and related parties  and energy marketing and trading companies 
we have concentrations of credit risk related to our geographic location in the western united states and western canada energy markets 
these concentrations of counterparties and concentrations of geographic location may affect our overall exposure to credit risk because the counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in conditions 
demands for collateral credit risk affects demands on our capital 
we are subject to limits and credit terms that counterparties may assert to allow us to enter into transactions with them and maintain acceptable credit exposures 
many of our counterparties allow unsecured credit at limits prescribed by agreements or their discretion 
capital requirements for certain transaction types involve a combination 
table of contents avista corporation of initial margin and market value margins without any unsecured credit threshold 
counterparties may seek assurances of performance from us in the form of letters of credit  prepayment or cash deposits 
credit exposure can change significantly in periods of price volatility 
as a result  sudden and significant demands may be made against our credit facilities and cash 
we actively monitor the exposure to possible collateral calls and take steps to minimize capital requirements 
counterparties credit exposure to us is dynamic in normal markets and may change significantly in more volatile markets 
the amount of potential default risk to us from each counterparty depends on the extent of forward contracts  unsettled transactions and market prices 
there is a risk that we may seek additional collateral from counterparties that are unable or unwilling to provide it 
risk management for energy resources we have an energy resources risk policy  which includes our wholesale energy markets credit policy and control procedures to manage energy commodity price and credit risks 
our risk management committee established our risk management policy for energy resources 
the risk management committee is comprised of certain officers and other management 
our risk management committee also established our wholesale energy markets credit policy 
the credit policy is designed to reduce the risk of financial loss in case counterparties default on delivery or settlement obligations and to conserve our liquidity as other parties may place credit limits or require cash collateral 
the audit committee of the company s board of directors periodically reviews and discusses enterprise risk management processes  and it focuses on the company s material financial and accounting risk exposures and the steps management has undertaken to control them 
our risk management committee reviews the status of risk exposures through regular reports and meetings 
nonetheless  adverse changes in commodity prices  generating capacity  customer loads  regulation and other factors may result in losses of earnings  cash flows and or fair values 
in implementing our risk management policy for energy resources  we measure the volume of monthly  quarterly and annual energy imbalances between projected power loads and resources 
the measurement process is based on expected loads at fixed prices including those subject to retail rates and expected resources to the extent that costs are essentially fixed by virtue of known fuel supply costs or projected hydroelectric conditions 
to the extent that expected costs are not fixed  either because of volume mismatches between loads and resources or because fuel cost is not locked in through fixed price contracts or derivative instruments  our risk policy guides the process to manage this open forward position over a period of time 
normal operations result in seasonal mismatches between power loads and available resources 
we are able to vary the operation of generating resources to match parts of intra hour  hourly  daily and weekly load fluctuations 
we use the wholesale power markets  including the natural gas market as it relates to power generation fuel  to sell projected resource surpluses and obtain resources when deficits are projected 
we buy and sell fuel for thermal generation facilities based on comparative power market prices and marginal costs of fueling and operating available generating facilities and the relative economics of substitute market purchases for generating plant operation 
to address the impact on our operations of energy market price volatility  our hedging practices for electricity including fuel for generation and natural gas extend beyond the current operating year 
executing this extended hedging program may increase our credit risks 
our credit risk management process is designed to mitigate such credit risks through limit setting  contract protections and counterparty diversification  among other practices 
our projected retail natural gas loads and resources are regularly reviewed by operating management and the risk management committee 
to manage the impacts of volatile natural gas prices  we seek to procure natural gas through a diversified mix of spot market purchases and forward fixed price purchases from various supply basins and time periods 
we have an active hedging program that extends four years into the future with the goal of reducing price volatility in our natural gas supply costs 
we use natural gas storage capacity to support high demand periods and to procure natural gas when prices are likely to be seasonally lower 
securing prices throughout the year and even into subsequent years mitigates potential adverse impacts of significant purchase requirements in a volatile price environment 
interest rate risk we are affected by fluctuating interest rates related to a portion of our existing debt  our future borrowing requirements  and our pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
the finance committee of our board of directors periodically reviews and discusses interest rate risk management processes  and it focuses on the steps management has undertaken to control it 
we manage interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposures to a percentage of total capitalization 
additionally  interest rate risk is managed by monitoring market conditions when timing the issuance of long term debt and optional debt 
table of contents avista corporation redemptions and through the use of fixed rate long term debt with varying maturities 
we also hedge a portion of our interest rate risk with financial derivative instruments  which may include interest rate swaps and us treasury lock agreements 
these interest rate swap agreements are considered economic hedges against fluctuations in future cash flows associated with anticipated debt issuances 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million with mandatory cash settlement dates of june  october  and october which we entered into in september and june 
as of december   we had a current derivative liability of million and a long term derivative asset of million  with an offsetting regulatory asset and liability on the consolidated balance sheets in accordance with regulatory accounting practices 
we estimate that a basis point increase in forward libor interest rates as of december  would increase the interest rate swap derivative net asset by million  while a basis point decrease would decrease the interest rate swap net asset by million 
as of december   we had interest rate swap agreements with a total notional amount of million and a total derivative liability of million 
we estimated that a basis point increase in forward libor interest rates as of december  would have increased this derivative liability by million  while a basis point decrease would decrease the liability by million 
in may  we cash settled interest rate swap contracts notional amount of million and paid a total of million 
the interest rate swap contracts were settled in connection with the pricing of million of first mortgage bonds 
upon settlement of the interest rate swaps  the regulatory asset or liability included as part of long term debt will be amortized as a component of interest expense over the life of the forecasted interest payments 
the interest rate on million of long term debt to affiliated trusts is adjusted quarterly  reflecting current market rates 
amounts borrowed under our committed line of credit agreements have variable interest rates 
the following table shows our long term debt including current portion and related weighted average interest rates  by expected maturity dates as of december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value fixed rate long term debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate nonrecourse long term debt of spokane energy weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt to affiliated trusts weighted average interest rate foreign currency risk a significant portion of our utility natural gas supply including fuel for electric generation is obtained from canadian sources 
most of those transactions are executed in us dollars  which avoids foreign currency risk 
a portion of our short term natural gas transactions and long term canadian transportation contracts are committed based on canadian currency prices 
the short term natural gas transactions are typically settled within sixty days with us dollars 
we economically hedge a portion of the foreign currency risk by purchasing canadian currency when such commodity transactions are initiated 
this risk has not had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows and these differences in cost related to currency fluctuations are included with natural gas supply costs for ratemaking 
as of december   we had a current derivative liability for foreign currency hedges of less than million included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance
