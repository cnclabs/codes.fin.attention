business description argan  inc the company  we  us  or our conducts continuing operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries  gemma power systems  llc and affiliates gps and southern maryland cable  inc smc 
through gps  we provide a full range of development  consulting  engineering  procurement  construction  commissioning  operations and maintenance services to the power generation and renewable energy markets for a wide range of customers including public utilities  independent power project owners  municipalities  public institutions and private industry 
we have also determined that gps is the primary beneficiary of two variable interest entities that were formed during the year ended january  for the purpose of developing a pair of gas fired power plants 
the combination of gps and the variable interest entities represent our power industry services business segment 
through smc  we provide telecommunications infrastructure services including project management  construction and maintenance to local governments  the federal government  telecommunications and broadband service providers as well as electric utilities 
argan  inc is a holding company with no operations other than its investments in gps and smc 
at january   there were no restrictions with respect to inter company payments from gps or smc to the holding company 

table of contents overview and outlook for the year ended january   the consolidated net revenues of continuing operations were million which represented an increase of million  or  from the net revenues of continuing operations of million for the prior year 
income from continuing operations attributable to our stockholders for the year ended january  was approximately million  or per diluted share 
comparable income from continuing operations was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  net income attributable to our stockholders for the year ended january  was approximately million  or per diluted share 
we reported net income attributable to our stockholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended january  the increase in consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january   compared with the net revenues from continuing operations for the year ended january   was due primarily to an increase of in the net revenues of the power industry services business  which represented of consolidated net revenues for the year ended january  the net revenues of the telecommunications infrastructure services business for the year ended january  increased by  to million for the current year compared with net revenues of approximately million for the year ended january  our balance of cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million during the year ended january  our stronger operating results for the current year  compared with the corresponding periods last year  were due to increased business activity in both of our business segments 
most significantly for gps  construction efforts associated with its sentinel project provided approximately of the net revenues of the power industry services business segment for the current year 
this power plant construction project  which is approximately complete  includes the design  procurement and construction of an megawatt gas fired electricity peaking facility located in southern california 
the telecommunications infrastructure services segment earned a substantial portion of its net revenues for the year ended january  by providing outside plant services to the one maryland broadband network project 
this effort  sponsored by the state of maryland for the deployment of a state wide  high speed  fiber optic network  intends to connect over  community anchor institutions in every county in the state while interconnecting and extending three independent information networks 
by comparison  the net revenues for the year ended january  were depressed  reflecting the transition for us between major projects 
in the period december to july  we substantially completed three energy plant construction projects 
substantial work on new projects did not commence until the latter half of the year ended january  as a result  the net revenues of our power industry services business for the year ended january  were adversely impacted  particularly during the first three quarters 
primarily due to the increase in net revenues from continuing operations in the year ended january   gross profit rose by approximately million compared with last year 
also  our overall gross profit percentage increased to approximately for the current year from a comparable gross profit percentage of approximately last year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or approximately  for the year ended january  compared with the comparable expense amount for last year 
the net result was that income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended january  increased by approximately million  to million from million for the year ended january  as of january   the value of our construction contract backlog was million compared with a backlog value of million as of january  approximately of our current backlog relates to two projects  the sentinel project described above and a megawatt biomass fired power plant under construction in east texas 
the rest of the backlog amount primarily relates to a wind farm project and a solar powered energy facility 
only million in the value of new work was added to our construction contract backlog during the year ended january  however  we have been chosen to design and construct two natural gas fired power plants in the marcellus shale region of pennsylvania  and we expect to execute epc contracts for these projects during the year ending january  each plant is being developed in order to provide over megawatts of electricity to the power grid on the east coast 
we expect construction activity to begin on at least one of the plants in fiscal year should these projects be delayed  our future results of operations  including net revenues  income from operations and net cash flows from operations  will be adversely affected  beginning in the second half of fiscal year 
table of contents on april   we announced that gemma power  inc gpi  an affiliate of gps and wholly owned by us  had entered into a consent and intercreditor agreement in connection with the design and construction of an megawatt gas fired power plant in bradford county  pennsylvania 
gpi has been funding moxie liberty  llc moxie liberty in the development of this power plant project and has advanced approximately million in working capital to the project 
on march   moxie energy  llc moxie entered into a membership interests purchase agreement with a third party investor who agreed to provide advances for certain preconstruction costs 
the consummation of the purchase of moxie liberty  wholly owned by moxie  is contingent upon the third party investor securing permanent financing for the project 
should the third party investor consummate the purchase of moxie liberty  gps would be engaged to design and build the plant under an engineering  procurement and construction contract  and gpi would receive development success fees and repayment of the working capital advances plus accrued interest from the proceeds of the sale 
current economic conditions in the united states reflect ongoing weakness in construction and many other industry sectors 
stubbornly high unemployment  the depressed state of the housing industry  reduced state and local government budgets and sluggish manufacturing activity all contributed to significant reductions in construction spending in the united states from pre recession levels 
although we are technically in the midst of an overall economic recovery  the progress is sluggish  particularly in the construction sectors 
affecting us specifically  these factors have resulted in minimal new demands for electricity which in turn has resulted in power plant operators experiencing less urgency to build new electricity generating power plants 
in addition  the remaining instability in the financial markets may be continuing to make it difficult for certain of our customers  particularly for projects funded by private investment  to access the credit markets to obtain financing for new construction projects on satisfactory terms or at all 
adding to an overall sense of economic uncertainty in the united states are concerns about the inability of the federal government to agree on a comprehensive budget plan and the effects of drastic automatic federal spending cuts 
the power industry has not fully recovered from the recessionary decline in the demand for power in the united states 
in fact  electrical power generation in the united states declined in for the second year in a row 
as it will likely take at least several years for power consumption to reach pre recession peak levels  certain existing power plants will continue to operate with spare capacity to produce electricity 
despite the reductions in the demand for power during this period  certain regions of the country continued to add power generation facilities over the last several years  gas fired and wind energy facilities in particular 
the combination of these new electricity generation plants and excess power generation capacity elsewhere will likely temper the need to build power plants during the expected recovery period for power demand 
the expected increase in momentum towards more environmentally friendly power generation facilities has not occurred at the pace expected prior to the latest recession 
the federal government has failed to pass comprehensive energy legislation  including incentives or mandates for the retirement of existing coal burning power plants and caps on the volume of carbon emissions 
in the federal legislation enacted at year end avoiding the so called fiscal cliff  the renewable electricity production credit was generally extended for energy projects with construction beginning before wind facilities must be placed in service by then  solar fields must be placed in service before 
due to concerns that energy tax credit and grant programs would be expiring permanently  there was a rush to complete wind and solar projects by december  in fact  over of our country s wind power capacity was added during calendar however  at present  there is no bipartisan agreement regarding the long term future of government incentives for sources of renewable power in either legislative house of congress 
with the future long term availability of renewable energy tax incentives unknown and the development pipeline depleted  potential energy project developers and investors are not making commitments related to new renewable energy generation facilities 
as a result  the likelihood of our booking additional wind and solar power projects next year is uncertain 
although certain coal fired power plants have been shut down and the demand for coal has been adversely affected by the inexpensive supply of natural gas in the united states  existing coal plants are proving to be a challenge to retrofit or replace 
coal prices are widely considered to be stable and certain states see the availability of inexpensive  coal fired electricity as a key driver of economic growth 
new regulations regarding air pollution are being promulgated by states and the us environmental protection agency the epa 
however  these measures are subject to a number of legal challenges 
in early  a federal appeals court upheld the epa s greenhouse gas regulations  affirming the epa s finding that greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide endanger public health and likely have been responsible for global warming 
however  in august  the same appeals court struck down an epa rule that placed tight curbs on coal fired power plant emissions across state lines 

table of contents we believe that it is likely that the soft demand for power will continue to limit the number of new energy plant construction opportunities through our fiscal year ending january  in addition  we expect that the new opportunities which do arise will continue to result in fierce competition among bidders 
the reduction in the number of new commercial  industrial and infrastructure construction projects has created an extremely competitive bid environment in our construction sector 
certain of our competitors are global engineering and construction firms  substantially larger than us 
on occasion  our relatively smaller size is evaluated to be a risk by potential project owners 
known competitors have reduced prices  presumably willing to sacrifice margin in order to keep work crews busy 
other construction companies have entered our sector of the industry looking for new work at low margins 
although the power sector was one of the primary drivers of the recovery of overall nonresidential construction spending early in  the strength has weakened in the last several months according to construction industry analysts 
however  we continue to believe that the long term prospects for energy plant construction are extremely favorable 
major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing fracking have led to a boom in natural gas supply  driving prices to historic lows 
there is evidence that the abundant availability of cheap  less carbon intense  natural gas represents a significant factor in the economic assessment of the future for coal fired power plants 
the epa has demonstrated recent restraint in the amount of regulation contained in its initial federal fracking rules 
it also appears that the presidential administration is evolving in its support for increased natural gas exploration and production 
hard to ignore in this economic environment marked by high unemployment rates are a series of reports describing the significant contributions that the nonconventional oil and gas exploration industry is making to capital spending and employment in this country 
earlier this year  for the first time since the us energy information agency began compiling monthly statistics  natural gas and coal had the same share approximately of the country s net power generation 
for calendar year compared with  the amount of net electrical power generation in this country provided by natural gas and non hydro renewables including wind  biomass and solar increased by and  respectively  while the net power generation represented by coal declined by 
we also expect that continuing concerns about the safety  high cost and the construction cost overrun risk of nuclear power plants eventually will spur future development of renewable and cleaner gas fired power generation facilities which should result in new power facility construction opportunities for us 
the demand for electrical power in this country is expected to grow slowly but steadily over the long term 
certain sectors of the construction industry reported strong year over year improvements in spending  including lodging  education  office space and manufacturing 
recent manufacturing conditions in the united states have generally improved according to analysts as output accelerated  new orders increased and capacity utilization increased  although at a sluggish pace 
analysts also report that trend data for the current year shows the office sector continuing to recover as the net absorption of office space is positive 
these developments suggest increasing demands for power in the future 
increasing demands for electricity  the ample supply of natural gas  and the expected retirement of old coal  nuclear and oil powered energy plants  should result in gas fired and renewable energy plants  like wind  biomass and solar  representing the substantial majority of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix 
during this difficult time for the construction industry  particularly our sector  and until the recovery for our sector of the construction industry becomes more robust  we are focused on the effective and efficient completion of our current construction projects and the control of costs  which resulted in higher net revenues and favorable profit results for our fiscal year ending january  compared with the results for the year ended january  despite the intensely competitive business environment  we are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects 
this approach may result in a lower volume of new business bookings until the demand for new power generation facilities and the other construction industry sectors recover fully 
we will strive to conserve cash and to maintain an overall strong balance sheet 
however  we are seeing new business opportunities that include an opportunity to make an investment in the ownership of a new project  at least during the development phase of the project  in order to improve the probability of an epc contract award see additional discussion below 
because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet  we are willing to consider the opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks 

table of contents although the uncertain economic conditions do impair our forecasting visibility to an unusual degree  we remain cautiously optimistic about our long term growth opportunities 
we are focused on expanding our position in the growing power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of increasing electricity demand covering decades into the future 
we believe that our expectations are reasonable and that our future plans are based on reasonable assumptions 
moxie energy projects as is common in our industry  general construction contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures  limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of completing a project for an owner such as a government agency or a commercial enterprise 
these teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project 
in may  gemma power  inc gpi  an affiliate of gps and wholly owned by us agreed to the amendment and restatement of a development agreement with moxie energy  llc moxie which was executed last year  and which has provided gpi with an opportunity to support the development of power plant projects by moxie liberty  llc and moxie patriot  llc the moxie project entities with loans  the option to provide additional development loans and or equity investments to cover anticipated future costs and early design services 
as amended and restated  it contemplates that gpi will extend loans to the moxie project entities that may total up to million 
with the approval of the company s board of directors  gpi could increase the loan total to million 
each moxie project entity is developing a natural gas fired power plant in the marcellus shale region of pennsylvania 
the strategy of moxie is to locate these power plants near the source of natural gas and to provide transmitted electricity to the power grid in the northeastern united states  eliminating the need to transport natural gas via pipeline from well to power production plant 
through january   gpi had provided approximately million in cash to the moxie project entities under the initial development loans 
moxie has supported the arrangement by providing gpi with a series of liens  security interests  guarantees and development success fee preferences see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements which  together with the loans  provide us with substantial financial control over the moxie project entities which are wholly owned by moxie 
under the amended and restated development agreement  moxie has provided us with the right to build the two power plants under engineering  procurement and construction contracts epc contracts 
to date  the activities of the moxie project entities have been focused on obtaining the necessary permits to build and operate the power plants and to transmit the electricity produced there to users  completing electricity supply arrangements  negotiating with possible project owners and investors for the purchase of the projects  and securing permanent financing for the projects 
the completion of negotiations and the necessary agreements that could assure the commencement of construction of the power plants should occur in fiscal year we have evaluated the moxie project entities and concluded that they are variable interest entities under current accounting guidance vies 
despite lacking an ownership interest in the moxie project entities  we have concluded that gpi is currently the primary beneficiary of these vies due primarily to the significance of gpi s loans to the entities  the risk that gpi could absorb significant losses if the development projects are not successful  the opportunity for gpi to receive development success fees and the possibility of gps obtaining two large epc contracts for the construction of the power plants 
accordingly  the assets  liabilities and financial results of the moxie project entities have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the commencement and completion of either one of these power plants may be dependent upon the availability of financing for a project owner s 
failure to complete the development of the planned power plants as anticipated could result in a charge to earnings related to the balance of capitalized construction project costs which were included in property and equipment in the amount of approximately million as of january  such an adjustment could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for a future reporting period 
on the other hand  the successful completion of project development efforts and sale of at least one of the projects to an owner operator could result in loan repayments and the recognition of substantial development success fee income per the terms of the development agreement 
the amount of such fees could range between million and million 
it is likely that any such fee income would be earned and recorded by us in fiscal see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for announcements related to moxie liberty  llc and made by us subsequent to january  
table of contents discontinued operations in march  we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of vitarich laboratories  inc vli  a wholly owned subsidiary that represented our nutritional products business  to nbty florida  inc nbty 
the asset sale was consummated for an aggregate cash purchase price of up to  and the assumption by the purchaser of certain trade payables  accrued expenses and remaining obligations under vli s facility leases 
of the cash purchase price   was paid at closing and the remaining  was placed into escrow 
subsequently  vli was paid approximately  million cash from the escrow amount as purchased inventory was used in production by nbty and purchased accounts receivable balances were collected 
amounts received from the escrow account were recorded as sale proceeds upon receipt 
in december and pursuant to the terms of the asset sale agreement  the funds remaining in the escrow account were returned to nbty 
the financial results of this business through april  have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  including legal costs associated with this business 
such costs incurred subsequent to april   which were not material  have been reflected in the operating results of continuing operations 
the loss on discontinued operations incurred during the first quarter for the fiscal year ended january  was  we reported income from discontinued operations for the year ended january  in the amount of  including net gain on the sale of assets  before income taxes  in the amount of  and approximately  in income tax benefit related to the deduction  for income tax return purposes  for the worthless stock of vli 
these favorable amounts were offset partially by costs of operations incurred prior to the sale of assets and those related to the legal matter discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements

comparison of the results of operations for the years ended january  and the following schedule compares the results of our continuing operations for the years ended january  and except where noted  the percentage amounts represent the percentage of net revenues for the corresponding year 
as analyzed below the schedule  we reported net income attributable to our stockholders of approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january   we reported a comparable net income amount of million

table of contents net revenues power industry services the net revenues of the power industry services business increased significantly for the year ended january  to million for the current year from million for the prior year  an increase of 
the net revenues of this business represented approximately and of consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the net revenues of this business for the current year reflected performance on seven construction projects  including substantial construction activity related to a gas fired peaking power plant in southern california as well as equipment procurement and the commencement of construction related to a biomass fired power plant located in east texas for which we received the full notice to proceed in may we completed two wind farm efforts and a solar panel installation project during the current year 
the net revenues associated with the gas fired and the biomass projects represented approximately of this segment s net revenues for the current year 
the gas fired project is scheduled for completion during the summer of calendar year last year  we substantially completed three energy plant construction projects 
substantial work on new projects did not commence until the latter half of the fiscal year ended january  as a result  the net revenues of our power industry services business last year were adversely impacted  particularly during the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
for the year ended january   the net revenues related to two projects also represented approximately of the net revenues of the segment 
these projects included the gas fired peaking facility in southern california and a wind energy project located in illinois that was completed early in the year ended january  in addition  we completed construction of a power plant in connecticut that contributed net revenues which represented of this segment s net revenues for the year ended january  telecommunications infrastructure services primarily due to the new business discussed below  the net revenues of the telecommunications services business of smc increased by to million for the year ended january  compared with net revenues in the amount of million for the year ended january  historically  a major portion of this segment s revenue producing activity has been performed pursuant to task or work orders issued under master agreements with smc s major customers 
for the current year  approximately of smc s net revenues were derived from outside plant services provided for the one maryland broadband network project 
as identified above  this effort is sponsored by the state of maryland for the deployment of a state wide  high speed  fiber optic network 
our largest customer in this project is howard county  maryland  a key partner with the state representing a collaborative inter government consortium of local maryland governments that is deploying one of the three independent networks 
although we continue to receive task orders under this program  we expect that net revenues derived from this program for the fiscal year ending january  will decline substantially as the program nears completion 
we believe that smc s exposure to the state of maryland under this program led to the award to us by the state of a fiber optic network equipment procurement order 
our fulfillment of this order resulted in net revenues for the year ended january  that represented approximately of smc s business for the current year 
cost of revenues due primarily to the increase in consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the current year  the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased 
these costs were million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
our gross profit percentage increased for the current year to of corresponding net revenues from a comparable percentage of last year due to the profitable performance of activities on several projects of both business segments 
favorable estimated profit increases were reflected during the year as work progressed on the gas fired peaking facility and as the illinois wind farm project was completed 
the gross profit percentage achieved by gps for the year ended january  was favorably impacted by the recognition during the year of net revenues related to final change orders and contract cost close out adjustments associated with the completion of major construction projects 
smc was successful in continuing to improve the profitability of most elements of its business  its gross profit percentage was for the year ended january  compared with and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
the profitability of our operations for the current year was adversely affected by a charge to cost of revenues in the amount of  recorded in the second quarter 
this charge related to the altra legal matter that is described above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents as disclosed above  a substantial amount of our construction backlog relates to the sentinel gas fired power plant project located in southern california and scheduled for completion in july an important portion of the remaining activities for this project relate to the turbine commissioning phase 
under the epc contract  we must demonstrate the satisfactory start up and effective operation of each of the eight turbines installed for this energy plant 
due to the number of turbines and the number of necessary project approvals  we have allocated a substantial portion of our estimated costs to complete the project to this phase 
should the completion of this phase be executed in a more efficient and successful manner than expected  our project end adjustments may include the recognition of additional net revenues related to the cost savings 
selling  general and administrative expenses these costs increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended january  from approximately million for the year ended january  however  expressed as a percentage of corresponding consolidated net revenues  these costs declined to for the current year from last year 
the largest expense increases between years related to the increased costs associated with the moxie projects in the amount of  increased stock option compensation expense in the amount of  increased cash bonuses for management and staff in the amount of  compensation costs related to new employees in the amount of  and increased accounting and audit fees in the amount of  due  in part  to the sarbanes oxley act requirement for an integrated independent audit for the current year as the company has graduated to accelerated filer status at january  income tax expense for the year ended january   we incurred income tax expense related to continuing operations in the amount of million representing an annual effective income tax rate of 
the effective tax rate was higher than the expected federal income tax rate of due primarily to state income taxes and unfavorable adjustments offset partially by favorable income tax effects of permanent differences  including  related to the domestic manufacturing deduction

its consent is required for acquisitions  divestitures and cash dividends 
the amended financing arrangement contains an acceleration clause which allows the bank to declare amounts outstanding under the financing arrangements due and payable if it determines in good faith that a material adverse change has occurred in the financial condition of any of our companies 
the arrangement also requires the measurement of certain financial covenants at our fiscal year end and at each of our fiscal quarter ends using a rolling month period  determined on a consolidated basis  including requirements that the ratio of total funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  that the ratio of senior funded debt to ebitda as defined not exceed to  and that the fixed charge coverage ratio not be less than to at january  and january   we were in compliance with each of these financial covenants as we had no senior debt outstanding at either date 
we believe that the company will continue to comply with its financial covenants under the financing arrangement 
if the company s performance results in our noncompliance with any of the financial covenants  or if the bank seeks to exercise its rights under the acceleration clause referred to above  we would seek to modify the financing arrangement  but there can be no assurance that the bank would not exercise its rights and remedies under the financing arrangement including accelerating payment of any outstanding senior debt due and payable 
at january   most of the balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a high quality money market fund with at least of its net assets invested in us treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by us treasury obligations 
the fund is sponsored by an investment division of the bank 
our operating bank accounts are maintained with the bank 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from our future operations and funds continuing to be available under our line of credit will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future without deterioration of working capital 
any future acquisitions  or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement  may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  significant dilution to the existing stockholders may result 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering  procurement and construction contracts 
we provide guarantees related to our services or work 
if our services under a guaranteed project would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency  then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies 
when sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable  we would record such guarantee losses 
in the ordinary course of business  our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made 
each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation 
if necessary  we may obtain standby letters of credit from the bank in the ordinary course of business  not to exceed million 
the financial crisis associated with the recession did not disrupt our insurance or surety programs or limit our ability to access needed insurance or surety capacity 
we also have a line of credit committed by the bank in the amount of million for general purposes 
from time to time  we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services 
we collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity 
as of january   the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was approximately million 
we earned approximately  and  in fees during the years ended january  and  respectively 
inflation our monetary assets  consisting primarily of cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivables  and our non monetary assets  consisting primarily of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets  are not affected significantly by inflation 
we believe that replacement costs of our building  improvements  equipment and furniture will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our costs and expenses  such as those for employee compensation and benefits and commodities used in construction projects  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non gaap measurement we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure  the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions 
further  we believe that ebitda is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance 
as ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states us gaap  we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for  the results of our operations presented in accordance with us gaap that are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  our ebitda does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
the following table presents ebitda for continuing operations for the years ended january  and income from continuing operations  as reported interest expense income tax expense depreciation amortization of purchased intangible assets ebitda 
table of contents as we believe that our net cash flow from continuing operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with us gaap  the following table reconciles the amounts of ebitda for the applicable years  as presented above  to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows provided by continuing operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows ebitda current income tax expense interest expense non cash stock option compensation expense decrease in escrowed cash increase in accounts receivable change related to the timing of scheduled billings increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities other  net net cash provided by continuing operations critical accounting policies we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long term construction contracts  the valuation of goodwill  other indefinite lived assets and long lived assets  the valuation of employee stock options  income tax reporting and the disclosure of legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
a description of the company s significant accounting policies  including those discussed below  is included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended january  revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
the types of contracts may vary and include agreements under which net revenues are based on a fixed price or cost plus fee basis 
net revenues from cost plus fee construction agreements are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned  measured using the cost to cost method 
components of fee based on our achievement of certain cost or schedule objectives are included when we believe it is probable that such amounts have been earned 
net revenues from fixed price construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant costs  including materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimate 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual net revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we review the estimate of total cost on each significant contract monthly 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by management s experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses 

table of contents we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for the price associated with that scope change 
the costs associated with a scope change are expensed as incurred and included in the estimated amount of cost to complete the contract 
we recognize net revenue on an unapproved change order when realization of price approval is probable 
as of january   unapproved change orders in the aggregate amount of approximately million were included in the total contract value amounts and reflected in the estimated total cost amounts of the corresponding contracts 
disputed change orders that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are considered claims 
the company recognizes net revenues from a claim only when an agreement on the amount of the claim has been reached 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of gps and smc  we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships  non compete agreements and trade names 
other than goodwill  most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives 
at january   the total carrying value of goodwill was approximately million  which represented approximately of consolidated total assets and is related to the acquisition of gps 
the company has reviewed for impairment  at least annually  the carrying value of goodwill 
the annual review performance date is november we also perform tests for impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its value might be impaired 
as prescribed by current accounting guidance  we determine whether goodwill has been impaired or not using a two step process of analysis 
the first step of our goodwill impairment testing process is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the determination of the fair value of gps as of november  a variety of alternative valuation approaches were considered 
as a result of the analysis  we concluded that the market multiple and the discounted cash flow analysis approaches were the most appropriate valuation techniques for this exercise 
for the market multiple valuation  a fair value estimate for gps was determined based on an evaluation of the market values of a selected number of reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
a separate estimate was determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
projected cash flows for gps were developed based on its historical financial performance  a short term projection of operating results based on the existing backlog of current business and the assumed addition of certain identified future projects  and published projected growth rates for the power construction industry 
the projected cash flow amounts were discounted to present value based on rates of return which were determined considering prevalent rates of return  business risks for the industry and risks specifically related to gps 
a weighting was applied to the results of the market multiple valuation and the discounted cash flow analysis of fair value in order to arrive at an average amount considered the fair value of gps 
as a result of this valuation  we concluded that the fair value of the net assets of gps substantially exceeded its carrying amount 
therefore  the goodwill of gps was deemed not to be impaired  and the performance of step two of the impairment assessment process was not required 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued accounting standards update  testing goodwill for impairment  which is intended to simplify the two step goodwill impairment test required by current guidance 
the amendment will allow an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
an entity no longer will be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting entity unless the entity determines  based on a qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic  industry  market and entity specific factors 
we have elected to conduct our assessment of goodwill as of november  in accordance with the testing requirements of the guidance before amendment 
however  in the future we may elect to perform qualitative evaluations of gps in order to support the position that impairment of the goodwill of gps has not occurred and that its fair value continues to exceed its carrying value  thus avoiding the performance of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for gps 

table of contents long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of the building purchased by us in the current year and related improvements  equipment used in our operations and the asset consisting of the capitalized moxie project development costs 
fixed assets are carried at cost and such costs other than land are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from five to thirty nine years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of certain long lived assets is evaluated periodically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or a group of assets may not be recoverable 
if events and circumstances such as poor operating results of the applicable business segment indicate that the asset s should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  including disposition  on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets  are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets to determine if an impairment exists 
if we identify a potential impairment  we will estimate the fair value of the assets through known market transactions of similar equipment and other valuation techniques  which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
we will record a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair value 
deferred tax assets as of january  and  our consolidated balance sheets included net deferred tax assets in the total amounts of  and  respectively  resulting from our future deductible temporary differences 
in assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our ability to realize our deferred tax assets depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences and tax planning strategies 
if such estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
at this time  we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services business segment will continue during the periods in which the applicable temporary income tax differences become deductible 
accordingly  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
stock options we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the awards and recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods 
options to purchase  shares of our common stock were awarded during the year ended january  with a weighted average fair value per share amount of 
the amounts of compensation expense recorded during the years ended january  and related to vesting stock options were  and  respectively 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations which are disclosed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk free interest rate  the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of the stock option 
we use the simplified method in developing the estimates of the expected lives of stock options  as we believe that our historical stock option exercise experience is insufficient to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards 
legal contingencies as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  we are involved in several legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves in each case 
at this time  we do not believe that a material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed therein 
however  we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter 
we review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter  and make adjustments to the balances if necessary 
should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change  significant losses or additional costs may be recorded 
adopted and other recently issued accounting pronouncements there are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we consider material to our consolidated financial statements
