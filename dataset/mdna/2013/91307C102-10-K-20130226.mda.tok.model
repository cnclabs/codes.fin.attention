table of contents production and supply we synthesize treprostinil  the active ingredient in remodulin and tyvaso  and treprostinil diolamine  the active ingredient for oral treprostinil  at our facility in silver spring  maryland 
in march and august  we received fda approval to produce tyvaso and remodulin  respectively  at our silver spring facility 
in june  we received a good manufacturing practice certificate from the uk medicines and health products regulatory agency to produce remodulin and tyvaso in our silver spring facility 
baxter pharmaceutical solutions  llc baxter currently produces remodulin for commercial use for us 
in  we amended our contract with baxter to extend the contract term through the end of during the fourth quarter of  we notified baxter that we will not renew our current contract when it expires at the end of however  we expect to negotiate and enter into a new contract with baxter prior to the expiration of the current contract 
in  we also agreed with baxter  that remodulin will be produced using a different set of equipment and in larger quantities than the currently approved process 
since baxter will produce remodulin on different equipment and in a larger batch than the current process  we are required to have the new equipment and process approved by the fda 
we are currently conducting the validation and stability testing for the new equipment and process 
if the validation and stability testing are successful and we are successful in negotiating a new contract with baxter  we anticipate filing for regulatory approval of the new equipment and process shortly after entering into the new contract with baxter 
baxter continues to produce remodulin for us according to the currently approved process 
in  the fda and european regulatory authorities approved jubilant hollister stier contract manufacturing and services as an additional remodulin producer  in the larger quantities described above 
we rely on catalent pharma solutions  inc catalent to do the following conduct stability studies on remodulin  serve as an additional producer of tyvaso and oral treprostinil tablets  and analyze other products we develop 
we are also manufacturing oral treprostinil tablets  which are being used in our clinical trials  in our facility in research triangle park  north carolina rtp facility 
we intend to use our own facilities to produce our primary supply of remodulin  tyvaso and oral treprostinil tablets  and we will continue to contract with third parties to supplement our production capacity 
also  although we maintain a two year inventory of remodulin and tyvaso based on expected demand  we believe that having third parties approved to produce these products will mitigate some of our risks  including the risk that we might not be able to produce sufficient quantities to meet patient demand 
under our manufacturing and supply agreement with lilly  lilly manufactures and distributes adcirca through its wholesaler network in the same manner that it distributes its own pharmaceutical products 
under the terms of this agreement  we take title to adcirca upon completion of its manufacture by lilly 
adcirca is shipped to customers  generally pharmaceutical wholesalers  in accordance with purchase orders received by lilly 
although lilly provides these services on our behalf  we maintain the risk of loss as it pertains to inventory and non payment of invoices 
we manufacture the nebulizer used in our tyvaso inhalation system 
while we manage the manufacturing process  nebu tec supplies all the labor to manufacture the nebulizers 
in december  minnetronix  inc minnetronix was approved by the fda as a second manufacturer of the tyvaso inhalation system 
in july  we received fda approval for a modified tyvaso inhalation system based on the results of the completion of certain post marketing commitments relating to the inhalation device 
as a result  we are currently manufacturing the modified inhalation system td  which we expect to release commercially during consequently  as of december   we increased our reserves 
table of contents for inventory obsolescence by million based on the estimated cost of inhalation device inventory we do not expect to be salable as a result of the commercial release of td although we believe that other third parties could provide similar products  services and materials  there are few companies that could replace our existing producers and suppliers 
a change in supplier or manufacturer could cause a delay in the manufacture  distribution and research efforts associated with our respective products or result in increased costs

competition many drug companies engage in research and development to commercialize products to treat cardiovascular and infectious diseases and cancer 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with many approved products in the united states and the rest of the world  including the following flolan 
the first product approved by the fda for treating pah  flolan epoprostenol is a prostacyclin that is delivered by intravenous infusion 
glaxo began marketing flolan in the united states in in  myogen  inc myogen acquired the marketing rights from glaxo for flolan in the united states 
in  myogen was acquired by gilead sciences  inc gilead 
in  gilead returned the rights to flolan to glaxo 
the generic exclusivity period for flolan expired in april  generic epoprostenol and veletri 
in  teva announced that the fda approved its version of generic epoprostenol for the treatment of pah 
in  generamedix inc generamedix received fda approval for its version of epoprostenol  which is stable at room temperature 
in  actelion announced that it had entered into an agreement with generamedix to acquire its epoprostenol product  marketed as veletri  and began commercial sales in  ventavis and ilomedin 
approved in in the united states and in in europe  ventavis iloprost is an inhaled prostacyclin analogue 
ventavis was initially marketed by cotherix  inc cotherix in the united states and is marketed by bayer schering pharma ag bayer in europe as iloprost 
in  cotherix was acquired by actelion  the manufacturer and distributor of tracleer and distributor of veletri 
iloprost is also marketed by bayer in certain countries outside the united states in an intravenous form known as ilomedin  tracleer 
the first oral drug to be approved for pah  tracleer bosentan is also the first drug in its class  which consists of drugs known as etras 
tracleer was approved in in the united states and in in europe 
tracleer is marketed worldwide by actelion  letairis 
approved in in the united states  letairis ambrisentan is an oral therapy marketed by gilead for the treatment of pah 
like tracleer  letairis is an etra 
in  glaxo received marketing authorization from the ema for letairis in europe  where it is known as volibris  revatio 
approved in in the united states  revatio sildenafil citrate is also an oral therapy and is marketed by pfizer 
revatio contains sildenafil citrate  the same active ingredient as viagra  and is the first pde inhibitor to be approved for pah  and generic sildenafil citrate 
in the fourth quarter of  several companies began marketing generic formulations of sildenafil citrate 

table of contents there are also a variety of investigational pah therapies in the later stages of development  including the following macitentan  an oral etra being developed by actelion 
in november  actelion submitted an maa for macitentan to the ema 
in december  the fda accepted actelion nda for macitentan  riociguat  an oral agent targeting a similar vasodilatory pathway as pde inhibitors 
in february  bayer announced that it had filed an nda and a marketing authorization application maa for the approval of riociguat for the treatment of pah in the united states and europe  selexipag  an oral prostacyclin receptor agonist being developed jointly by actelion and nippon shinyaku co  ltd 
in japan  and by actelion outside japan  is currently undergoing a phase iii trial  and gleevec imatinib  a small molecule kinase inhibitor in oral tablet form approved for treating various cancers  is being studied for the treatment of pah 
novartis pharmaceuticals corporation novartis completed a phase iii trial of gleevec for the treatment of pah in september during the third quarter of  novartis withdrew its nda in order to submit additional data to the fda and during the first quarter of withdrew the maa it had filed with the ema 
oral therapies adcirca  revatio  generic sildenafil citrate  tracleer and letairis are commonly prescribed as first line treatments for the least severely ill patients nyha class ii patients 
as patients progress in their disease severity nyha class iii and iv  inhaled therapies tyvaso and ventavis or infusion therapies remodulin and flolan are commonly added 
the use of the available oral therapies and tyvaso  either alone or in combination  could delay the need for infusion therapy for many patients 
as a result  the success of other therapies in preventing disease progression affects our commercial products 
furthermore  the commercialization of generic forms of other approved pah therapies and the development of new pah therapies may exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products 
for further discussion on this risk  see item a risk factors we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
we could also face competition from generic pharmaceutical companies in the future 
in february  we received notice of an abbreviated new drug application by sandoz inc requesting fda approval to market a generic version of the mg ml strength of remodulin 
on december   we received notice that sandoz had amended its previously filed abbreviated new drug application to request additional approval to market generic versions of the mg ml  mg ml  and mg ml strengths of remodulin 
for further details  see the section below entitled governmental regulation hatch waxman act and item legal proceedings 
in addition  certain revatio patents expired in  leading several manufacturers to launch generic formulations of sildenafil citrate  which physicians could prescribe for the treatment of pah 
generic sildenafil citrate lower price  relative to adcirca  could lead to an erosion of adcirca market share and limit its growth potential 
although we believe adcirca once daily dosing regimen provides a significant competitive advantage over generic sildenafil citrate dosing regimen of three times per day  we expect government payers and private insurance companies to favor the use of the less expensive generic sildenafil citrate instead of adcirca 
we compete with the developers  manufacturers and distributors of all of these products for customers  funding  access to licenses  personnel  third party collaborators  product development and commercialization 
almost all of these companies have substantially greater financial  marketing  sales  
table of contents distribution and technical resources  and more experience in research and development  product development and marketing  clinical trials and regulatory matters  than we have 
governmental regulation pharmaceutical product approval process the research  development  testing  manufacture  promotion  marketing  distribution  sampling  storage  approval  labeling  record keeping  post approval monitoring and reporting  and import and export of pharmaceutical products drugs or biological products  hereinafter collectively drugs are extensively regulated by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
in the united states  failure to comply with requirements under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  the public health service act  and other federal statutes and regulations  may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions  such as fda refusal to approve pending ndas or biologics license applications blas  warning letters  product recalls  product seizures  total or partial suspension of production or distribution  injunctions  fines  civil penalties  and criminal prosecution 
satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements typically takes many years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
drugs are subject to rigorous regulation by the fda in the united states  the ema in the eu and similar regulatory authorities in other countries 
the steps ordinarily required before a new drug may be marketed in the united states  which are similar to steps required in most other countries  include preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical studies in animals  formulation studies and the submission to the fda of an investigational new drug application ind for a new drug  which must become effective before clinical testing may commence  clinical studies in healthy volunteers  clinical studies in patients to explore safety  efficacy and dose response characteristics  adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each indication  the submission of an nda or bla to the fda  and fda review and approval of the nda or bla prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation  as well as animal studies to explore toxicity and for proof of concept 
the conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including good laboratory practices 
in the united states  the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind  along with other information including information about product chemistry  manufacturing and controls and a proposed clinical trial protocol 
long term preclinical tests  such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity  may continue after the ind is submitted 
absent fda objection within days after submission of an ind  the ind becomes effective and the clinical trial proposed in the ind may begin 
at any time during this day period or at any time thereafter  the fda may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials 
the ind process may be extremely costly and may substantially delay development of our products 
moreover  positive results of preclinical tests will not necessarily indicate positive results in clinical trials 
clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator 
clinical trials must be 
table of contents conducted i in compliance with federal regulations  ii in compliance with good clinical practices gcp  an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors  administrators  and monitors  and iii under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial  the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the criteria to be evaluated 
each protocol involving testing on us patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind 
the fda may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with fda requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients 
the study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board irb for approval 
an irb may also require the clinical trial at a site to be halted temporarily or permanently for failure to comply with the irb requirements  or may impose other conditions 
clinical trials in support of an nda or a bla are typically conducted in three sequential phases  but the phases may overlap 
during phase i  the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients  the drug is tested to assess metabolism  pharmacokinetics  pharmacological actions  side effects associated with increasing doses  and  if possible  early evidence on effectiveness 
phase ii usually involves studies in a limited patient population to assess the efficacy of the drug in specific  targeted indications  assess tolerance and optimal dosage  and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks 
if a compound is found to be potentially effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in phase ii evaluations  then phase iii trials  also called pivotal studies  major studies or advanced clinical trials  are undertaken to demonstrate clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients  typically at geographically diverse clinical study sites  to permit the fda to evaluate the overall benefit risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug 
after successful completion of the required clinical testing  an nda or a bla is typically submitted to the fda in the united states  and an maa is typically submitted to the ema in the eu 
fda approval of the nda or bla is required before marketing of the product may begin in the us the nda or bla must include the results of all preclinical  clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product pharmacology  chemistry  manufacture  and controls 
the cost of preparing and submitting an nda or bla is substantial 
under federal law  the submission of most ndas and blas is additionally subject to a substantial application fee  currently exceeding million  and the manufacturer and or sponsor of an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment fees  currently exceeding  per product and  per establishment 
these fees are typically increased annually 
however  the application fees may be waived for orphan drugs if certain requirements are met 
the fda has days from its receipt of an nda or a bla to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review 
the fda has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications 
most such applications for non priority drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months  while most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months 
priority review can be applied to drugs that the fda determines offer major advances in treatment  or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists 
for biologics  priority review is further limited to drugs intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease 
the review process may be extended by the fda for three additional months to consider certain information submitted during fda review  including information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission 
the fda may also refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee  typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts  for review  evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be 
table of contents approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee  but it generally follows such recommendations 
before approving an nda or a bla  the fda will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with gcp 
additionally  the fda will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured 
the fda will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices is satisfactory and the nda or bla contains data that provide substantial evidence that the pharmaceutical product is safe and effective for the indication studied 
in the united states  after the fda evaluates the nda and the manufacturing facilities  the fda may issue either an approval letter or a complete response letter 
a complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the fda to reconsider the application 
if and when those conditions have been addressed to the fda satisfaction in a resubmission of the nda or bla  the fda will issue an approval letter 
the fda has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included 
a class resubmission may contain only limited information such as labeling  safety updates  stability updates  or minor analysis updates or clarifying information and is subject to a two month review period 
all other resubmissions are categorized as class and are subject to a six month review period 
an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications 
as a condition of nda approval  the fda may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks 
a rems can include medication guides  communication plans for healthcare professionals  and elements to assure safe use etasu 
etasu can include  but are not limited to  special training or recertification for prescribing or dispensing  dispensing only under certain circumstances  special monitoring  and the use of patient registries 
the requirement for a rems can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug 
to continue marketing our products after approval  applicable regulations require us to maintain a positive risk benefit profile  maintain regulatory applications through periodic reports to regulatory authorities  fulfill pharmacovigilance requirements  maintain manufacturing facilities according to the fda current good manufacturing practices requirements  and successfully complete regulatory agency inspections  among other requirements 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections 
once granted  product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing 
disclosure of clinical trial information sponsors of clinical trials of fda regulated drugs and other products are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information related to the product  patient population  phase of investigation  study sites and investigators  and other aspects of the clinical trial 
this clinical trial information is then made public as part of the sponsor registration 
sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion 
competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs 
orphan drugs under the orphan drug act  an applicant can request the fda to designate a product as an orphan drug in the united states if the drug is intended to treat an orphan  or rare  disease or condition 
a disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than  people in the united states 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda or bla 
after the fda grants orphan drug designation  the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process 
the first nda applicant to receive 
table of contents orphan drug designation and fda approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the us for that product  for that indication 
during the seven year period  the fda may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same disease  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the fda from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition  or the same drug for a different disease or condition 
among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the nda application user fee 
the fda granted orphan drug designation for the active ingredient treprostinil for the treatment of pah as a continuous infusion 
however  this designation does not preclude us from seeking orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration  such as oral or inhaled  of treprostinil to treat pah  or for treprostinil used to treat other orphan diseases 
in order for the fda to grant orphan drug designation for other formulations or routes of administration of treprostinil to treat pah  we must demonstrate that such new formulation or route of administration is clinically superior to the formulation or route of administration previously granted orphan drug designation 
the fda has granted orphan drug designation for tyvaso 
pediatric information under the pediatric research equity act of prea  ndas  blas and supplements to ndas and blas must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indication s in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each such pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers 
unless otherwise required by regulation  the prea does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted 
the best pharmaceuticals for children act bpca provides nda holders a six month extension of any exclusivity  patent or non patent  for a drug if certain conditions are met 
conditions for exclusivity include the fda determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population  the fda making a written request for pediatric studies  and the applicant agreeing to perform  and reporting on  the requested studies within the statutory timeframe 
applications under the bpca are treated as priority applications  with all of the benefits that designation confers 
hatch waxman act the hatch waxman act also known as the drug price competition and patent term restoration act was enacted in to encourage research and development of new drugs and competition between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies 
it created a faster approval process for generic drugs  called the abbreviated new drug application anda  while it provided protection to brand pharmaceuticals by extending their patent protection to compensate for patent time lost during the fda review and approval process and periods of market exclusivity to encourage continuing research on  for example  new uses  strengths or dosage forms for existing drugs 
in seeking approval of a drug through an nda  applicants are required to submit to the fda each patent that covers the applicant product or fda approved method of using this product 
upon approval of a drug  each of the patents listed in the application is then published in the fda approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  commonly known as the orange book 
drugs listed in the orange book can  in turn  be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an anda 
generally  an anda provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strength s  route of administration  and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug 
anda applicants are not required to conduct or submit results of pre clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product  other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing 
drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug  and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug 

table of contents the anda applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda orange book 
specifically  the applicant must certify that i the required patent information has not been filed  ii the listed patent has expired  iii the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration  or iv the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product 
a certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph iv certification 
if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents  the anda application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired 
alternatively  for a patent covering an approved method of use  an anda applicant may submit a statement to the fda that the company is not seeking approval for the covered use 
if the anda applicant has submitted a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda and patent holders once the anda has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of the receipt of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda until the earlier of months  expiration of the patent  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the anda applicant 
the anda application also will not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired 
federal law provides a period of five years following approval of a drug containing no previously approved active moiety  during which andas for generic versions of those drugs cannot be submitted unless the submission contains a paragraph iv challenge to a listed patent  in which case the submission may be made four years following the original product approval 
following approval of a listed drug that contains previously approved active ingredients but is approved in a new dosage form  route of administration or combination  or for a new condition of use that was required to be supported by new clinical trials conducted by or for the sponsor  federal law provides for an exclusivity period of three years  during which the fda cannot grant effective approval of an anda for such new condition of use  dosage form or strength that meets certain statutory requirements 
both of the five year and three year exclusivity periods  as well as any unexpired patents listed in the orange book for the listed drug  can be extended by six months if the fda grants the nda sponsor a period of pediatric exclusivity based on studies submitted by the sponsor in response to a written request 
the hatch waxman act provides that patent terms may be extended to compensate for some of the patent life that is lost during the fda regulatory review period for a product 
this extension period would generally be one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of an nda  plus all of the time between the submission date of an nda and its approval  subject to a maximum extension of five years 
similar patent term extensions are available under european laws 
following fda approval  we filed a patent term extension application with the united states patent and trademark office for our patent covering the method of treating pah using remodulin 
the application was approved in february with the maximum patent term extension of five years  and the patent will expire on october  in february  we received notice of an abbreviated new drug application by sandoz inc requesting fda approval to market a generic version of the mg ml strength of remodulin 
on december   we received notice that sandoz had amended its previously filed abbreviated new drug application  and was requesting additional approval to market generic versions of the mg ml  mg ml  and mg ml strengths of remodulin 
for further details  see item legal proceedings 

table of contents section b new drug applications most drug products other than biological products obtain fda marketing approval pursuant to an nda or an anda 
a third alternative is a special type of nda  commonly referred to as a section b nda  which enables the applicant to rely  in part  on the fda finding of safety and efficacy data for an existing product  or published literature  in support of its application 
section b ndas often provide an alternate path to fda approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products 
section b permits the filing of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
the applicant may rely upon certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product 
the fda may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product 
the fda may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved  as well as for any new indication for which the section b nda applicant has submitted data 
to the extent that the section b applicant is relying on prior fda findings of safety and efficacy  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the orange book to the same extent that an anda applicant would 
thus  approval of a section b nda can be delayed until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired  until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired  and  in the case of a paragraph iv certification and subsequent patent infringement suit  until the earlier of months  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the section b nda applicant 
other regulatory requirements once an nda or a bla is approved  a product will be subject to certain post approval requirements 
for instance  the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs  including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet 
pharmaceutical products may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling 
changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application  including changes in indications  labeling  or manufacturing processes or facilities  require submission and fda approval of a new or supplemental nda bla before the change can be implemented 
an nda bla supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application  and the fda uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing supplements as it does in reviewing ndas or blas 
adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports continue to be required following fda approval of an nda or a bla 
the fda also may require post marketing testing  known as phase iv testing  risk minimization action plans  and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product 
in addition  quality control as well as drug manufacture  packaging  and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices cgmps after approval 
manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmps 
accordingly  manufacturers must continue to expend time  money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cgmps 
regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request 
table of contents product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered 
marketing pharmaceutical products outside the united states outside of the united states  our ability to market our products is also contingent upon receiving marketing authorizations from regulatory authorities 
the foreign regulatory approval process may include some or all of the risks associated with fda approval set forth above 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and marketing authorization vary widely from country to country 
in the eu  marketing authorizations may be submitted through a centralized body or through a decentralized mutual recognition or a national level process 
the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products  high technology products and orphan products and may be available at the applicant option for other products 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid in all eu member countries 
the decentralized mutual recognition procedure is available for all medicinal products that are not subject to the centralized procedure 
the decentralized mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions  changes existing procedures for national approvals and establishes procedures for coordinated eu actions on products  suspensions and withdrawals 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marketing authorization for which mutual recognition is sought may submit an application to one or more eu member countries  certify that the dossier is identical to that on which the first approval was based  or explain any differences and certify that identical dossiers are being submitted to all eu member countries for which recognition is sought 
within days of receiving the application and assessment report  each eu member country is required to decide whether to recognize approval 
the procedure encourages member states to work with applicants and other regulatory authorities to resolve disputes concerning mutual recognition 
lack of objection of a given country within days automatically results in approval in that country 
following receipt of marketing authorization in an eu member country  the applicant is then usually depending on the country required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with a separate prescription pricing authority in that country 
commercial sales typically only commence in a country once pricing approval has been obtained 
to secure european regulatory approvals for subcutaneous remodulin for pah  we used the mutual recognition process 
under the rules then applicable  centralized filing was not required and we perceived the decentralized mutual recognition procedure to be the most effective means for approval 
we filed our first maa in france in february review of our application was completed in as a result  remodulin was approved in member countries of the eea under the mutual recognition process described above 
we withdrew applications in spain  the united kingdom and ireland and are currently evaluating resubmitting applications in spain and ireland 
in december  we received approval for intravenous remodulin in all of the member nations where subcutaneous remodulin is approved 
to secure european regulatory approval for tyvaso  we submitted an maa to the ema via the centralized process in regulations in europe have changed since we made our initial filing for remodulin and all therapies for orphan diseases must now use the centralized process 
in february  we withdrew our maa from consideration by the ema due to the ema major objection related to findings of non compliance with good clinical practice at two clinical sites 
the ema stated that these findings would preclude a recommendation for approval of tyvaso in the eu 
the ema had no major objections at the time of withdrawal related to the safety or efficacy of tyvaso 

table of contents biologics biological products used for the prevention  treatment  or cure of a disease  or condition  of a human being are subject to regulation under the fdc act  except the section of the fdc act which governs nda applications 
instead  biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the public health service act phsa via a bla 
however  the application process and requirements for approval of blas are very similar to those for ndas 
to help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents  the phsa emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined 
the phsa also provides authority to the fda to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health  to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs  and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction  or spread  of communicable diseases in the united states and between states 
after a bla is approved  the product may also be subject to official lot release 
as part of the manufacturing process  the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution 
if the product is subject to official lot release by the fda  the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the fda together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer tests performed on the lot 
the fda may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products  such as viral vaccines  before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer 
in addition  the fda conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety  purity  potency  and effectiveness of biological products 
as with drugs  after approval of biologics  manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise  are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing  and are subject to periodic inspection after approval 
the ppaca included a subtitle called the biologics price competition and innovation act of  or bpci act  which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to  or interchangeable with  an fda licensed reference biological product 
this is conceptually similar to the hatch waxman act in that it attempts to minimize duplicative testing 
biosimilarity  which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety  purity  and potency must be shown through analytical studies  animal studies  and at least one clinical study absent a waiver 
interchangeability requires that a product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and  for products administered multiple times  the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic 
however  complexities associated with the larger  and often more complex  structures of biological products  as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured  pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being addressed by the fda 
a reference biologic is granted twelve years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product 
the first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of i one year after first commercial marketing  ii eighteen months after the initial application if there is no legal challenge  iii eighteen months after the resolution in the applicant favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics patents if an application has been submitted  or iv months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the month period 
because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks  their use may be restricted in some countries 

table of contents cell and tissue based biologics manufacturers of cell and tissue based products must comply with the fda current good tissue practices cgtp  which are fda regulations that govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the manufacture of such products 
the primary intent of the cgtp requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction  transmission and spread of communicable diseases 
cell and tissue based products may also be subject to the same approval standards  including demonstration of safety and efficacy  as other biologic and drug products  if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non homologous use a use different from the cell origin 
us regulation of medical devices new medical devices are also subject to fda approval and extensive regulation under the fdca 
under the fdca  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  class ii  or class iii 
the classification of a device into one of these three classes generally depends on the degree of risk associated with the medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness 
class i devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to a set of general controls 
these general controls include compliance with the applicable portions of the fda quality system regulation qsr  which sets forth good manufacturing practice requirements  facility registration and product reporting of adverse medical events listing  truthful and non misleading labeling  and promotion of the device only for its cleared or approved intended uses 
class ii devices are also subject to these general controls and to any other special controls as deemed necessary by the fda to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device 
review and clearance by the fda for these devices is typically accomplished through the so called k pre market notification procedure 
a class iii device requires approval of a premarket application pma  an expensive  lengthy and uncertain process requiring many years to complete 
when k clearance is sought  a sponsor must submit a pre market notification demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously approved device 
if the fda agrees that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device  then k clearance to market will be granted 
after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  requires a new k clearance or could require pre market approval 
clinical trials are almost always required to support a pma and are sometimes required for a k pre market notification 
these trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption  or ide 
an ide must be supported by pre clinical data  such as animal and laboratory testing results  which show that the device is safe to test in humans and that the study protocols are scientifically sound 
the ide must be approved in advance by the fda for a specified number of patients  unless the product is deemed a non significant risk device and is eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements 
both before and after a medical device is commercially distributed  manufacturers and marketers of the device have ongoing responsibilities under fda regulations 
the fda reviews design and manufacturing practices  labeling and record keeping  and manufacturers required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices 
device manufacturers are subject to periodic and unannounced inspection by the fda for compliance with the qsr  current good manufacturing practice requirements that govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging  servicing  labeling  storage  installation  and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use 

table of contents if the fda finds that a manufacturer has failed to comply or that a medical device is ineffective or poses an unreasonable health risk  it can institute or seek a wide variety of enforcement actions and remedies  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe actions such as fines  injunctions  and civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing requests for k clearance or pma approval of new products  withdrawing k clearance or pma approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to require repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any medical device 
the fda also administers certain controls over the export of medical devices from the united states  as international sales of medical devices that have not received fda approval are subject to fda export requirements 
additionally  each foreign country subjects such medical devices to its own regulatory requirements 
in the eu  a single regulatory approval process has been created  and approval is represented by the ce mark 
the nebulizer used with our tyvaso inhalation system was included in our nda for tyvaso  and was cleared by the fda subject to compliance with the qsr as it applies to combination products 
in july  we received fda approval for a modified tyvaso inhalation system using an updated nebulizer td based on the results of the completion of the qsr compliance commitments 
government reimbursement of pharmaceutical products in the united states  many independent third party payers  as well as the medicare and state medicaid programs  reimburse buyers of our commercial products 
medicare is the federal program that provides health care benefits to senior citizens and certain disabled and chronically ill persons 
medicaid is the federal program administered by the states to provide health care benefits to certain indigent persons 
the medicare contractors who administer the program provide reimbursement for remodulin at a rate equal to of the published average wholesale price as of october  the medicare part b payment formula  under the durable medical equipment regional carrier guidelines  for drugs infused through durable medical equipment and for tyvaso at a rate of of the average sales price the medicare part b payment formula for drugs inhaled through durable medical equipment and also under the durable medical equipment regional carrier guidelines 
adcirca  an oral drug  is reimbursed under the medicare part d program 
the state medicaid programs also generally provide reimbursement for our commercial products  at reimbursement rates that are below the published average wholesale price and that vary from state to state 
in return for including our pharmaceutical commercial products in the medicare part b and medicaid programs  we have agreed to pay a rebate to state medicaid agencies that provide reimbursement for those products 
we have also agreed to sell our commercial products under contracts with the department of veterans affairs  department of defense  public health service and numerous other federal agencies as well as certain hospitals that are designated as b covered entities entities designated by federal programs to receive drugs at discounted prices at prices that are significantly below the price we charge to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors 
these programs and contracts are highly regulated and impose restrictions on our business 
failure to comply with these regulations and restrictions could result in a loss of our ability to continue receiving reimbursement for our drugs 
we estimate that between of remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca sales in the united states are reimbursed under the medicare and medicaid programs 

table of contents anti kickback  false claims laws and the prescription drug marketing act in addition to fda restrictions on marketing pharmaceutical products  several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years 
these laws include anti kickback statutes and false claims statutes 
the federal healthcare program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for the purchase  lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers  purchasers and formulary managers on the other 
violations of the anti kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment  criminal fines  civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs 
although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions  the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing  purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting  or causing to be presented  a false claim for payment to the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing to be made  a false statement to have a false claim paid 
many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services  which in turn were used by the government to set medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates  and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
in addition  certain marketing practices  including off label promotion  may also violate false claims laws 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer products from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
as part of the sales and marketing process  pharmaceutical companies frequently provide samples of approved drugs to physicians 
the prescription drug marketing act pdma imposes requirements and limitations upon the provision of drug samples to physicians  and prohibits states from licensing distributors of prescription drugs unless the state licensing program meets certain federal guidelines that include minimum standards for storage  handling and record keeping 
in addition  the pdma sets forth civil and criminal penalties for violations 
patient protection and affordable care act of the patient protection and affordable care act of  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of ppaca is intended to expand healthcare coverage within the us several provisions of the new law  which have varying effective dates  may affect us and will likely increase certain of our costs 
for example  an increase in the minimum medicaid rebate rate from percent to percent of average manufacturer price became effective as of january  and the volume of rebated drugs has been expanded to include beneficiaries in medicaid managed care organizations  effective as of march the ppaca also imposes an annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers  based on the manufacturer sale of branded pharmaceuticals and biologics excluding orphan drugs to certain us government programs during the preceding year  expands the b drug discount program excluding orphan drugs including the creation of new penalties for non compliance  
table of contents and includes a discount on brand name drugs for medicare part d participants in the coverage gap  or donut hole 
the law also revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes effective october  which could increase the amount of the medicaid drug rebates paid to states 
the ppaca also created a regulatory pathway for the abbreviated approval of biological products that are demonstrated to be biosimilar or interchangeable with an fda approved biological product 
in order to meet the standard of interchangeability  a sponsor must demonstrate that the biosimilar product can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product  and for a product that is administered more than once  that the risk of switching between the reference product and biosimilar product is not greater than the risk of maintaining the patient on the reference product 
such biosimilars would reference biological products approved in the us the law establishes a period of years of data exclusivity for reference products  which protects the data in the original bla by prohibiting sponsors of biosimilars from gaining fda approval based in part on reference to data in the original bla 
in addition  the ppaca imposes new reporting requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  with the first report due on march  in addition  pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will be required to report investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year 
such information is to be made publicly available by the secretary of health and human services in a searchable format beginning september  failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to  per year and up to million per year for knowing failures for all payments  transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 
further  the ppaca amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statute 
a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 
in addition  the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws 
state pharmaceutical and medical device marketing laws if not preempted by the ppaca  several jurisdictions  including the district of columbia  maine  massachusetts  minnesota  vermont and west virginia  require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to healthcare practitioners in those jurisdictions 
some of these jurisdictions also prohibit various marketing related activities 
still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes 
in addition  certain states  such as california  connecticut  nevada  and massachusetts  require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals 
compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming  and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties

risk factors forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act and the private securities litigation reform act of which are based on our beliefs and expectations as to future outcomes 
these statements include  among others  statements relating to the following expectations of revenues  expenses  profitability  and cash flows  the sufficiency of current and future working capital to support operations  our ability to obtain future financing  the value of our common stock and our ability and plans to complete future common stock repurchases  the maintenance of domestic and international regulatory approvals  the expected volume and timing of sales of remodulin treprostinil injection remodulin  tyvaso treprostinil inhalation solution tyvaso  and adcirca tadalafil tablets adcirca  our expectations to commercially launch in a modified tyvaso inhalation system approved by united states food and drug administration fda in td and regarding the potential to increase the number of patients using tyvaso through the further improvement of the tyvaso inhalation system  our expectation to make tyvaso available in certain european and latin american countries in on an unmarketed  named patient basis based on physicians prescriptions in those countries  the timing and outcome of clinical studies and related regulatory filings  including our further studies of oral treprostinil and our aim to obtain fda approval for oral treprostinil before the end of  our plan to file for approval for oral treprostinil in europe upon the completion of the freedom ev study  and the expectation that medtronic inc medtronic will complete its phase iii study of remodulin administered with the synchromed implantable pump  the timing and outcome of required pricing approvals and risk management plan approvals in individual european countries  in order to begin marketing intravenous remodulin in those countries  the expected likelihood and timing of regulatory submissions and approvals for drug candidates under development and the timing of related sales  including our anticipated application for approval of remodulin in japan  our pending application for approval of remodulin in china  and our expected filing of a biologics license application with the fda and a marketing authorization application with the european medicines agency ema for ch  
table of contents our expectation that we will enter into a new contract with baxter pharmaceutical solutions  llc baxter  relating to the production of remodulin  by the end of when the current contract term expires  the outcome of potential future regulatory actions  including audits and inspections  from the fda and international regulatory agencies  the impact of competing therapies  including generic products and newly developed therapies  on sales of our commercial products  the expectation that we will be able to produce sufficient quantities and maintain adequate inventories of our commercial products  through both our in house production capabilities and third party production sites for our products  and our ability to obtain and maintain related approvals by the fda and other regulatory agencies  the adequacy of our intellectual property protections and the expiration dates of the patents we own and our licensed patents and products  our expectations regarding our ability to defend our intellectual property relating to remodulin against generic challenges  including the abbreviated new drug application filed by sandoz inc sandoz  the potential impact of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of on our business  the impact of the business combination between express scripts  inc the parent company of curascript  inc 
and medco health solutions  inc the parent company of accredo health group  inc on our business  any statements that include the words believe  seek  expect  anticipate  forecast  project  intend  estimate  should  could  may  will  plan  or similar expressions  and other statements contained or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts 
the statements identified as forward looking statements may appear in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from anticipated results 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 

table of contents risks related to our business we rely heavily on sales of remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca to generate revenues and support our operations 
sales of remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca comprise virtually all of our revenues 
a wide variety of events  many of which are described in other risk factors below  could cause sales of these products to decline 
for instance  if regulatory approvals for any of these products were withdrawn  we would be unable to sell the product and our business could be jeopardized 
any substantial change in the prescribing practices or dosing patterns of patients using remodulin  tyvaso or adcirca due to combination therapies  side effects  adverse events  deaths or any other reasons  could decrease related revenues 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  generic sildenafil citrate became commercially available  which could result in a decrease in adcirca market share  or limit its growth potential 
in addition  we rely on third parties to produce  market  distribute and sell remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca 
the inability of any one of these third parties to perform these functions satisfactorily could negatively affect our revenues 
we are also increasingly internalizing elements of our production process for remodulin and tyvaso  and any failure to manage our internal production processes could result in an inability to meet demand 
because we are highly dependent on sales of remodulin  tyvaso and adcirca  a reduction in sales of any one of these products could have a negative and material adverse impact on our operations 
we have had periods in which we incurred losses and may not maintain profitability 
we have experienced financial reporting periods in which we incurred net losses 
while we believe we develop our annual cash based operating budgets using reasonable assumptions and targets  unanticipated factors  including those outside of our control  could affect our profitability and cause uneven quarterly and or annual operating results 
if our products fail in clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products 
to obtain regulatory approvals from the fda and international regulatory agencies such as the ema  we must conduct clinical trials demonstrating that our products are safe and effective 
in the past  several of our product candidates failed or were discontinued at various stages in the development process 
moreover  we may need to amend ongoing trials or the fda and international regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional trials beyond those we planned 
such occurrences could result in significant delays and additional costs  and related clinical trials may be unsuccessful 
approval of an nda could be subject to delays if the fda determines that it cannot review or approve the nda as submitted 
in such a case  the fda would issue a refuse to file letter or a complete response letter outlining deficiencies in the submission  and the fda may require substantial additional studies  testing or information in order to complete its review of the application 
we may fail to address any of these deficiencies adequately and consequently would be unable to obtain fda approval to market the product candidate 
in addition  we have commenced a new phase iii clinical trial  freedom ev  which is a study of oral treprostinil in combination with other approved pah therapies 
one co primary end point of the study is time to clinical worsening 
based on a complete response letter we received from the fda regarding our nda for oral treprostinil  it appears that the clinical worsening endpoint has become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy in pah patients to the fda standards 
we have not previously conducted a study with a time to clinical worsening primary endpoint 
our inexperience with this type of trial design may impact our ability to achieve positive results 
failure to prove the efficacy of oral treprostinil in combination with other pah therapies could hinder our ability to obtain fda approval of oral treprostinil 
in light of the complete response letter from the fda  we may need to 
table of contents amend or replace the freedom ev study  or supplement it with additional studies which could further delay the approval of oral treprostinil 
the length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for marketing varies by product  product use and country 
furthermore  we cannot predict with certainty the length of time it will take to complete necessary clinical trials or obtain regulatory approval of our future products 
our clinical trials may be discontinued  delayed or disqualified for various reasons 
these reasons include the drug is ineffective  or physicians believe that the drug is ineffective  patients do not enroll in our studies at the rate we expect  ongoing or new clinical trials conducted by drug companies in addition to our own clinical trials reduce the availability of patients for our trials  patients experience severe side effects during treatment  other investigational or approved therapies are viewed as more effective or convenient by physicians or patients  our clinical trial sites  contracted clinical trial administrators or clinical studies conducted entirely by third parties do not adhere to trial protocols and required quality controls under good clinical practice gcp under fda regulations and similar regulations outside the united states  our trials do not comply with applicable regulations or guidelines  we do not pass inspections by regulatory agencies  patients die during our trials because of an adverse event related to the trial drug  their disease is too advanced  or they experience other medical complications  drug supplies are unavailable or unsuitable for use in our studies  the results of preclinical testing raise concerns regarding product safety or efficacy  and the results of our clinical trials conducted in countries outside of the united states are not acceptable to the united states or other countries  and the results of our clinical trials conducted in the united states are not acceptable to regulators in other countries 
in addition  the fda and its international counterparts have substantial discretion over the approval process for pharmaceutical products 
as such  these regulatory agencies may not agree that we have demonstrated the requisite level of product safety and efficacy to grant approval 
our future growth depends  in part  on our plans to develop oral treprostinil 
if we fail to secure fda approval for oral treprostinil  our revenue growth prospects could be materially adversely affected 
in  we reported that our freedom c phase iii clinical trial of oral treprostinil in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension pah did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint p 
these results prompted us to amend the protocol for our freedom m phase iii clinical trial of oral treprostinil and initiate an additional phase iii clinical trial of oral treprostinil  freedom c in june  we announced the completion of the freedom m trial  which achieved statistical significance for its primary endpoint p 
however  our freedom c trial did not achieve statistical significance for its primary endpoint p  as we announced in august in october  the fda issued a complete response letter  declining to approve our nda for oral treprostinil 
although we have resubmitted our nda in response to the complete response letter  
table of contents and the fda has set a targeted response date of march   there can be no guarantee that the fda will complete its review of our resubmission in a timely manner 
although we aim to obtain regulatory approval of oral treprostinil before the end of  the fda may not approve oral treprostinil on this timetable  or at all 
for example  approval may be further delayed if the results of our freedom ev phase iii clinical trial or other clinical studies are required for approval 
future studies of oral treprostinil may ultimately fail to support fda approval for oral treprostinil  for the reasons described above under the risk factor entitled if our products fail in clinical trials  we will be unable to obtain or maintain fda and international regulatory approvals and will be unable to sell those products  among others  which would have a significant impact on our future revenue growth 
we may not compete successfully with established and newly developed drugs or products  or the companies that develop and market them 
we compete with well established drug companies for  among other things  funding  licenses  expertise  personnel  clinical trial patients and investigators  consultants and third party collaborators 
we also compete with these companies for market share 
most of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  sales  distribution and technical resources than we do 
these competitors also possess more experience in areas such as research and development  clinical trials  sales and marketing and regulatory matters 
there are several treatments that compete with our commercial therapies  as well as several other therapies under development  including various late stage investigational products that have recently completed or are undergoing phase iii pivotal trials 
for the treatment of pah  we compete with a number of approved products in the united states and worldwide  including the following flolan  ventavis  ilomedin  tracleer  revatio  letairis  veletri  generic epoprostenol and generic sildenafil citrate 
patients and doctors may perceive these competing products  or products developed in the future  as safer  more effective  more convenient and or less expensive than our therapies 
alternatively  doctors may reduce the prescribed doses of our products if they prescribe them in combination with our competitors products 
in addition  certain competing products are less invasive than remodulin and the use of these products may delay or prevent initiation of remodulin therapy 
any of these circumstances may suppress our sales growth or cause our revenues to decline 
certain of our competitors  such as actelion ltd 
and gilead sciences  inc  have achieved considerable market penetration and dominance in the pah therapeutic area 
furthermore  the future commercialization and introduction of new pah therapies and generic versions of our competitors products may saturate the market which could exert downward pressure on the pricing of our products and or reduce our market share 
discoveries or development of new products or technologies by others may make our products obsolete or seemingly inferior 
other companies may discover or introduce new products that render all or some of our technologies and products obsolete or noncompetitive 
our commercial therapies may have to compete with numerous investigational products currently in development  including several investigational pah therapies for which phase iii pivotal trials are underway or have been recently completed 
in addition  alternative approaches to treating chronic diseases  such as gene therapy or cell therapy  may make our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
if introduced into the market  investigational therapies for pah could be used in combination with  or as a substitute for  our therapies 
if this occurs  doctors may reduce or discontinue the use of our products for their patients 

table of contents sales of our products are subject to reimbursement from government agencies and other third parties 
pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement pressures may negatively impact our sales 
the commercial success of our products depends  in part  on the availability of reimbursements by governmental payers such as medicare and medicaid  and private insurance companies 
accordingly  our commercial success is tied to such third party payers 
in the united states  the european union and other significant or potentially significant markets for our products  government payers and or third party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medicinal products and are frequently challenging the pricing of new and expensive drugs 
our prostacyclin analogue products remodulin and tyvaso are expensive therapies 
consequently  it may be difficult for our specialty pharmaceutical distributors or wholesalers to obtain adequate reimbursement for our products from third party payers to yield sufficient profit to motivate such distributors or wholesalers to support our products 
alternatively  third party payers may reduce the amount of reimbursement for our products based on changes in pricing of other therapies for pah 
if third party payers do not approve our products for reimbursement  or limit reimbursements  patients could choose competing products that are approved for reimbursement or provide lower out of pocket costs 
presently  most third party payers  including medicare and medicaid  provide reimbursement for our commercial products 
future reimbursements under medicare and medicaid could be subject to reduction 
furthermore  to the extent that private insurers or managed care programs follow any reduced medicaid and medicare coverage and payment developments  the negative impact on our business would be compounded 
we continue to assess the potential effect of the patient protection and affordable care act and the related health care and education reconciliation act of the acts on our business 
while our business has not been impacted materially thus far as a result of the acts  we continue to monitor the developments of this legislation as many of its provisions are not yet effective and still subject to finalization 
in the united states  there is an increased focus from the federal government and others on analyzing the impact of various regulatory programs on the federal deficit  which could result in increased pressure on federal programs to reduce costs 
in addition  financial pressures may cause government or other third party payers to seek cost containment more aggressively through mandatory discounts or rebates on our products  policies requiring the automatic substitution of generic products  higher hurdles for initial reimbursement approvals for new products or other similar measures 
for example  there have been recent proposals to reduce reimbursement rates and or adopt mandatory rebates under medicare part b  which covers remodulin and tyvaso 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement from government health care programs could have a material adverse effect on sales of our products  our business and results of our operations 
in europe  the success of our commercial products and future products depends largely on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement 
in many european countries  patients are unlikely to use prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments 
countries in europe are under increasing pressure to reduce the cost of health care 
changes to current reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to sell our products or sell our products on a profitable basis 
in many markets outside the united states  governments control the prices of prescription pharmaceuticals through the implementation of reference pricing  price cuts  rebates  revenue related taxes and profit control 
furthermore  international governments expect prices of prescription pharmaceuticals to decline over the life of the product or as prescription volumes increase 
in addition  in december  we received marketing approval for the intravenous use of remodulin in most of the countries that are members of the european economic area eea  however  we are in the process of obtaining approval of our risk management plan on a country by country basis  and we must obtain pricing approval in each of these member countries before we can market remodulin for intravenous use 
delays in obtaining these approvals could have a significant impact on our future revenue growth 
additionally  in granting pricing approval for the intravenous use of remodulin  a 
table of contents member country may approve a lower reimbursement price for intravenous remodulin than for subcutaneous remodulin  or reduce the reimbursement price for both methods of administering remodulin 
any regulatory action requiring additional information or a reduction in the reimbursement rates for intravenous and subcutaneous remodulin could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and our business 
finally  the ultimate pricing and reimbursement of our investigational products  upon their approval  is inherently uncertain and subject to the risks discussed above 
our production strategy exposes us to significant risks 
we must be able to produce sufficient quantities of our commercial products to satisfy increases in demand for our products 
the process of producing our products is difficult and complex  and currently involves a number of third parties 
we synthesize treprostinil  the active ingredient in remodulin and tyvaso  and treprostinil diolamine  the active ingredient in oral treprostinil  in our silver spring  maryland facility using raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
although we formulate remodulin and tyvaso at our own facilities  we also outsource the formulation of remodulin to baxter and jubilant hollister stier contract manufacturing and services jubilant hollister stier and we outsource the formulation of tyvaso to catalent pharma solutions  inc catalent 
we manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system at our facility in germany and also through minnetronix  inc as long as we utilize third party vendors for significant portions of our production process  we will remain exposed to the risks described below under the risk factor entitled we rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party suppliers and service providers fail to perform 
in addition  while we are in the process of internalizing additional processes to increase our control of production  this approach will also subject us to risks as we engage in increasingly complex production processes 
for example  remodulin and tyvaso must be formulated in a sterile environment and we have limited experience with sterile manufacturing on a commercial scale 
some of the products we are developing will involve even more complicated production processes than our current products 
for example  we are developing ch mab  a monoclonal antibody 
as with all biologic products  monoclonal antibodies are inherently more difficult to produce than our current products and involve increased risk of viral and other contaminants 
in  the fda issued an advisory to manufacturers regarding the potential formation of glass fragments in injectable drugs filled in small volume glass vials 
we conducted a review of our manufacturing processes and those of our third party suppliers and have no conclusive evidence at this time to suggest that the glass vials we use for remodulin form glass fragments 
we continue to assess our products  but cannot guarantee that our production process will not result in hazards such as these 
additional risks presented by our production strategy include we and our third party producers are subject to the fda current good manufacturing practices in the united states and similar regulatory standards internationally 
while we have significant control over regulatory compliance with respect to our internal production processes  we do not exercise the same level of control over regulatory compliance by our third party producers  as we expand our production operations to include new elements of the production process or new products  we may experience difficulty designing and implementing processes and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable regulations  
table of contents even if we and our third party producers are in compliance with domestic and international drug production regulations  the sterility and quality of the products being produced could be substandard and  therefore  such products would be unavailable for sale or use  if we had to replace our own production operations or a third party producer  the fda and its international counterparts would require new testing and compliance inspections 
furthermore  a new producer would have to be familiarized with the processes necessary to produce and commercially validate our products  as producing our treprostinil based products is complex 
any new third party producer and any new production process at our own facilities would be subject to approval by the fda and its international counterparts before being used to produce commercial supply of our products  we may be unable to contract with needed producers on satisfactory terms or at all  and the supply of materials and components necessary to produce and package our products may become scarce or interrupted 
disruptions to the supply of these materials could delay the production and subsequent sale of such products 
any products produced with substituted materials or components would be subject to approval from the fda and international regulatory agencies before they could be sold 
the timing of any such regulatory approval is difficult to predict 
any of these factors could disrupt sales of our commercial products  delay clinical trials or commercialization of new products  result in product liability claims and product recalls  and entail higher costs 
we rely in part on third parties to perform activities that are critical to our business 
our ability to generate commercial sales or conduct clinical trials could suffer if our third party suppliers and service providers fail to perform 
we involve third parties extensively to assist us in conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  conducting pharmacovigilance related activities  including drug safety and reporting of adverse events  and marketing and distributing our products 
the involvement of third parties is necessary because we do not possess the internal capacity  and in certain cases the expertise  to perform all of these functions 
accordingly  the success of these third parties in performing their contractual obligations is critical to our operations 
we synthesize treprostinil using raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds supplied by vendors 
the inability of our vendors to supply these raw materials and advanced intermediate compounds in the quantities we require could delay the production of treprostinil for commercial use and for use in our clinical trials 
we rely on baxter and jubilant hollister stier to formulate remodulin for us 
as part of an existing contract with baxter  we agreed that baxter will formulate remodulin in greater quantities using larger production equipment than under its current process 
this new formulation process and related equipment will require fda and international approvals 
during the fourth quarter of  we notified baxter that we will not renew our current contract when it expires at the end of we believe that we will be able to negotiate a new contract with baxter prior to the expiration of the current contract 
there can be no assurance  however  that these negotiations will be successful 
although we have received fda and international approvals to produce remodulin using our silver spring  maryland facility  we remain reliant on third parties such as baxter and jubilant hollister stier for additional capacity and production for international sales 
we received fda approval to formulate tyvaso in our silver spring  maryland facility  however  we remain reliant on catalent to supplement our production capacity and serve as a backup producer 

table of contents we also rely substantially on nebu tec and minnetronix  inc to manufacture the nebulizer used in the tyvaso inhalation system 
we substantially rely on these third parties to adhere to and maintain production processes in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements 
if any of these critical third party production and supply arrangements are interrupted for compliance issues or other reasons  we may not have sufficient inventory to meet future demand 
we rely on accredo health group  inc accredo  curascript  inc curascript and cvs caremark caremark to distribute and sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states 
these distributors are also partially responsible for negotiating reimbursements from third party payers for the cost of our therapies 
from time to time  we increase the price of products sold to our us based and international distributors 
our price increases may not be fully reimbursed by third party payers 
if our distributors do not achieve acceptable profit margins on our products  they may reduce or discontinue the sale of our products 
furthermore  if our international distributors devote fewer resources to selling our products or are unsuccessful in their sales efforts  our revenues may decline materially 
in april  express scripts  inc the parent company of curascript acquired medco health solutions  inc the parent company of accredo 
as a result of the merger  our products may be less significant to the overall operations of the combined company and the merged company may devote fewer resources toward the sale and support of our products  which could adversely impact our revenues 
in addition  the combined company pharmacy benefit management business may have increased leverage in negotiating the terms of rebates and discounts on behalf of third party payers  which could impact reimbursement levels for our products 
we rely on eli lilly and company lilly to manufacture and supply adcirca for us  and we use lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network to distribute adcirca in the united states and puerto rico 
if lilly is unable to manufacture or supply adcirca or its distribution network is disrupted  it could delay  disrupt or prevent us from selling adcirca  which could slow the growth of our business 
in addition  lilly has the right to determine the wholesale price of adcirca  which generally moves in parity with the wholesale price lilly sets for cialis both of these products contain the same active ingredient 
since fda approval of adcirca  lilly has generally announced price increases on both cialis and adcirca twice per year 
changes in lilly wholesale prices could adversely impact demand or reimbursement for adcirca  particularly in light of the commercial availability of generic sildenafil citrate  the active ingredient in revatio 
although most of our current suppliers and service providers could eventually be replaced  a change in suppliers and or service providers could interrupt the manufacture and distribution of our commercial products and our other products and services  and impede the progress of our clinical trials  commercial launch plans and related revenues 
interruptions in our production process could be significant given the length of time and complexity involved in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals for alternative arrangements  through either third parties or internal manufacturing processes 
we rely heavily on third parties to conduct our clinical trials 
in addition  the success of certain products we are developing will depend on clinical trials sponsored by third parties 
examples of such clinical trials include a phase iii study of ch conducted by the national cancer institute  and an ongoing study conducted by medtronic using its implantable pump to deliver intravenous remodulin 
failure by any of these parties to conduct or assist us in conducting clinical trials in accordance with study protocols  quality controls and gcp could limit our ability to rely on results of those trials in seeking regulatory approvals 

table of contents our operations must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other countries  including fda regulations 
failure to obtain approvals on a timely basis or to achieve continued compliance could delay  disrupt or prevent the commercialization of our products 
the products we develop must be approved for marketing and sale by regulatory agencies and  once approved  are subject to extensive regulation 
our research and development efforts must comply with extensive regulations  including those promulgated by the fda and the united states department of agriculture 
the process of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals for new drugs is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
the manufacture  distribution  advertising and marketing of these products are also subject to extensive regulation  including strict pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting requirements 
any future product approvals we receive could be accompanied by significant restrictions on the use or marketing of a given product 
furthermore  our product candidates may fail to receive marketing approval on a timely basis  or at all 
if granted  product approvals can be withdrawn for failure to comply with regulatory requirements  such as post marketing requirements and post marketing commitments  or upon the occurrence of adverse events subsequent to commercial introduction 
discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products or problems with our manufacturing  regulatory  compliance  research and development  pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting  marketing or sales activities could result in regulatory restrictions on our products up to and including withdrawal of our products from the market 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  we could be subject to penalties that may consist of fines  suspension of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of our products and or criminal prosecution 
in addition  our reputation could be harmed as a result of any such regulatory restrictions or actions  and patients and physicians may avoid the use of our products even after we have resolved the issues that led to such regulatory action 
we are subject to ongoing regulatory review of our currently marketed products 
after our products receive regulatory approval  they remain subject to ongoing regulation  which can impact  among other things  product labeling  manufacturing practices  pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting  storage  distribution  advertising and promotion  and record keeping 
if we do not comply with applicable regulations  the range of possible sanctions may include adverse publicity  product recalls or seizures  fines  total or partial suspensions of production and or distribution  suspension of marketing applications  and enforcement actions  including injunctions and civil or criminal prosecution 
further  the fda often requires post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products 
the fda and comparable international regulatory agencies may condition approval of our product candidates on the completion of such post marketing clinical studies 
these post marketing studies may suggest that a product causes undesirable side effects or may present a risk to the patient 
if data we collect from post marketing studies suggest that one of our approved products may present an unacceptable safety risk  regulatory authorities could withdraw the product approval  suspend production or place other marketing restrictions on that product 
if regulatory sanctions are applied or if regulatory approval is delayed or withdrawn  our operating results and the value of our company may be adversely affected 
regulatory approval for our currently marketed products is limited by the fda to those specific indications and conditions for which clinical safety and efficacy have been demonstrated 
any regulatory approval of our products is limited to specific diseases and indications for which our products have been deemed safe and effective by the fda 
in addition to the fda approval required for new formulations  any new indication for an approved product also requires fda approval 
if we are not able to obtain fda approval for any desired future indications for our products  our ability to effectively market and sell our products may be reduced 

table of contents while physicians may choose to prescribe drugs for uses that are not described in the product labeling and for uses that differ from those approved by regulatory authorities called off label uses  our ability to promote the products is limited to those indications that are specifically approved by the fda 
although us regulatory authorities generally do not regulate the behavior of physicians  they do restrict communications by companies on the subject of off label use 
if our promotional activities fail to comply with these regulations or guidelines  we may be subject to warnings from  or enforcement action by  these authorities 
in addition  failure to follow fda rules and guidelines relating to promotion and advertising can result in the fda refusal to approve a product  suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  product recalls  fines  disgorgement of money  operating restrictions  injunctions or criminal prosecution 
we must comply with various laws in jurisdictions around the world that restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
failure to comply with such laws could result in penalties and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
various laws in jurisdictions around the world  including anti kickback and false claims statutes  the foreign corrupt practices act and the uk bribery act  restrict particular marketing practices in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries 
our business activities may be subject to challenge under these laws  and any penalties imposed upon us could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we have significantly expanded our sales and marketing staff 
any expansion of sales and marketing efforts can increase the risks of noncompliance with these laws 
in the united states  the federal health care program anti kickback statute prohibits  among other things  knowingly and willfully offering  paying  soliciting  or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for the purchase  lease  order or arranging the purchase  lease or order of any health care product or service reimbursable under medicare  medicaid or any other federally financed health care program 
this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers and prescribers  purchasers  and formulary managers 
although a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors exist to protect certain common activities from prosecution  the exemptions and safe harbors are narrow  and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescriptions  purchases  or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor 
our practices may not always meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection 
federal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting or causing the presenting of a false claim for payment by the federal government  or knowingly making  or causing a false statement to be made in order to receive payment of a false claim 
several pharmaceutical and health care companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product 
other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the company marketing of the product for unapproved  and thus non reimbursable  uses 
the majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti kickback law and false claims laws  which apply to items and services reimbursed under medicaid and other state programs  or  in several states  apply regardless of the payer 
sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties  exclusion of a manufacturer product from reimbursement under government programs  criminal fines  and imprisonment 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca imposes new reporting requirements for pharmaceutical and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals  effective march  in addition  pharmaceutical and device manufacturers will be required to report and disclose investment interests held by physicians and their 
table of contents immediate family members during the preceding calendar year 
such information is to be made publicly available by the secretary of health and human services in a searchable format beginning september  failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to  per year and up to million per year for knowing failures for all payments  transfers of value or ownership or investment interests not reported in an annual submission 
further  the ppaca amends the intent requirement of the federal anti kickback and criminal health care fraud statutes 
a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to be in violation of it 
in addition  the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims laws 
if not preempted by this federal law  several states currently require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in those states 
depending on the state  legislation may prohibit various other marketing related activities  or require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes 
in addition  certain states  such as california  nevada  and massachusetts  require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes and several other states are considering similar proposals 
compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming  and companies that do not comply with these state laws will face civil penalties 
government health care reform could increase our costs  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
our industry is highly regulated and changes in law may adversely impact our business  operations or financial results 
the ppaca is a sweeping measure intended to expand health care coverage within the united states  primarily through the imposition of health insurance mandates on employers and individuals and expansion of the medicaid program 
the reforms imposed by the new law will significantly impact the pharmaceutical industry  however  the full effects of the ppaca will be unknown until these provisions are implemented and the centers for medicare and medicaid services and other federal and state agencies issue applicable regulations or guidance 
moreover  in the coming years  additional changes could be made to governmental health care programs that could significantly impact the success of our products or product candidates 
reports of actual or perceived side effects and adverse events associated with our products  such as sepsis  could cause physicians and patients to avoid or discontinue use of our products in favor of alternative treatments 
reports of side effects and adverse events associated with our products could have a significant adverse impact on the sale of our products 
an example of a known risk associated with intravenous remodulin is sepsis  which is a serious and potentially life threatening infection of the bloodstream caused by a wide variety of bacteria 
intravenous prostacyclins  such as intravenous remodulin and flolan  are infused continuously through a catheter placed in a large vein in the patient chest  and sepsis is a known risk associated with this type of delivery 
as a result  sepsis is included as a risk in both the remodulin and flolan package inserts 
although a discussion of the risk of sepsis is currently included on the remodulin label  and the occurrence of sepsis is familiar to physicians who prescribe intravenously administered therapies  concerns about bloodstream infections may adversely affect a physician decision to prescribe remodulin 

table of contents our corporate compliance program cannot guarantee that we comply with all potentially applicable federal  state and international regulations 
the development  manufacture  distribution  pricing  sales  marketing  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive federal  state  local and international regulations  which are constantly evolving 
these regulations are subject to frequent revisions that often introduce more stringent requirements 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of penalties including  but not limited to the termination of clinical trials  the failure to receive approval of a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of our products from the market  significant fines  exclusion from government health care programs and other sanctions or litigation 
negative attention from special interest groups may impair our business 
as is common with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  our early stage research and development involves animal testing  which we conduct both directly and through contracts with third parties 
notwithstanding the vital role of animal research in the drug discovery and development process  certain special interest groups categorically object to the use of animals for research purposes 
historically  our research and development activities have not been the subject of significant animal rights media attention 
however  research activities with animals have been the subject of adverse attention  generally including demonstrations near facilities operated by other companies in our industry 
any negative attention  threats or acts of vandalism directed against our animal research activities in the future could impair our ability to operate our business effectively 
if any of the license or other agreements under which intellectual property rights are licensed to  or were acquired by us are breached or terminated  our right to continue to develop  produce and sell the products covered by such agreement could be impaired or lost 
our business depends upon our continuing ability to exploit our intellectual property rights in the drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others and those for which we are developing further and commercializing 
these intellectual property rights have either been contractually licensed to us or have been acquired by us 
under each of our product license agreements  we are granted a license to exploit certain intellectual property owned by others that covers a drug or other product 
under each of our purchase agreements  we have purchased certain intellectual property that covers a drug or other product 
we may be required to obtain a license of other intellectual property owned by third parties to continue to develop and commercialize our products 
this dependence on intellectual property developed by others involves the following risks we may be unable to obtain rights to intellectual property that we determine we need for our business at a reasonable cost or at all  if any of our product licenses or purchase agreements are terminated  we may lose our rights to develop  make and sell the products to which such licenses or agreements relate  our license and purchase agreements generally provide the licensor or seller with the right to terminate the agreement in the event we breach such agreement eg  if we fail to pay royalties and other fees timely and do not cure the failure within a stated time period  and if a licensor of intellectual property that is exclusively licensed to us breaches its obligation or otherwise fails to maintain the intellectual property licensed to us  we may lose any ability to prevent others from developing or marketing similar products that are covered by such intellectual property 
in addition  we may be forced to incur substantial costs to maintain the intellectual property ourselves or take legal action seeking to force the licensor to do so 

table of contents certain agreements under which we acquired or licensed intellectual property rights may restrict our ability to develop related products in certain countries or for particular diseases and may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market related products in the most effective manner 
when we acquire or license intellectual property rights to drugs and other products that have been discovered and initially developed by others  these rights are frequently limited 
for instance  our rights to market adcirca are geographically limited to the united states and puerto rico 
furthermore  we cannot undertake any additional investigational work with respect to adcirca in other indications of pulmonary hypertension without lilly prior approval 
lilly also has authority over all regulatory activities and has the right to determine the net wholesale price for adcirca 
provisions in our license and purchase agreements may impose other restrictions that affect our ability to develop and market products to which the intellectual property relates 
for example  glaxosmithkline plc retained an exclusive option and right of first refusal to negotiate an agreement with us if we decide to license any commercialization rights with respect to remodulin and tyvaso anywhere in the world 
our intellectual property rights may not effectively deter competitors from developing competing products that  if successful  could materially adversely affect our revenues and profits 
the period under which our commercial and developmental therapies are protected by our patent rights is limited 
our us patent for the method of treating pah with remodulin will expire in october three of our us patents covering our current methods of synthesizing and producing treprostinil  the active ingredient in both remodulin and tyvaso  expire in october other patents and patent applications in the us and other countries relating to our treprostinil products remain in force or are pending  respectively 
we also have been granted one patent in the european union and one patent in japan  each of which covers our treprostinil synthesis and production methods that will expire in october our us patent covering an improved diluent for remodulin will expire in march the patent for adcirca for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension will expire in and our patents for tyvaso will expire in the united states and in various countries throughout the european union in and  respectively 
we continue to conduct research into new methods to synthesize treprostinil and have pending us and international patent applications and granted patents relating to such methods 
however  we cannot be sure that these additional patents will successfully deter competitors  or that additional patent applications will result in grants of patents 
upon the expiration of any of our patents  competitors may develop generic versions of our products that were covered by the expired patents and may market those generic versions to compete with our products 
competitors may also seek to design around our patents prior to their expiration in an effort to develop competing products that do not infringe our patents 
the scope of any patent we hold may not deter competitors from developing a product that competes with the product we sell that is covered by the patent 
patent laws of foreign jurisdictions may not protect our patent rights to the same extent as the patent laws of the united states 
furthermore  our suppliers who have granted us exclusive rights may have inadequate intellectual property protections 
competitors also may attempt to invalidate our existing patents before they expire 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary know how and other technological advances that we do not disclose to the public 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and others to whom we disclose trade secrets and other confidential information 
these agreements do not necessarily prevent our trade secrets from being used or disclosed without our authorization and confidentiality agreements may be difficult to enforce or may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure 

table of contents the validity  enforceability and scope of certain of our patents covering remodulin are currently being challenged as a result of a recent abbreviated new drug application anda filing from a generic drug company 
the outcome of current or any future challenges to the validity  enforceability or scope of our patent portfolio could significantly reduce revenues from remodulin 
in february  we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter original notice letter from sandoz advising that sandoz has submitted an anda to the fda requesting approval to market a generic version of the mg ml strength of remodulin 
in december  we received notice second notice letter that sandoz had amended its previously filed anda to request approval to market generic versions of the mg ml  mg ml  and mg ml strengths of remodulin 
in the notice letters  sandoz states that it intends to market a generic version of remodulin before the expiration of us patent no 
 which expires in october  us patent no 
 which expires in october  and us patent no 
 which expires in march we responded to the original notice letter by filing a lawsuit in march against sandoz in the us district court for the district of new jersey alleging patent infringement 
we responded to the second notice letter by filing an additional lawsuit in january for patent infringement in the us district court for the district of new jersey 
the current status of our litigation with sandoz is further described in item legal proceedings  elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
there can be no assurance that we will prevail in our defense of our patent rights 
our existing patents could be invalidated  found unenforceable or found not to cover a generic form of remodulin 
if sandoz or another anda filer were to receive approval to sell a generic version of remodulin and or prevail in any patent litigation  remodulin would become subject to increased competition and our revenue would be adversely affected 
in addition  regardless of the outcome  any patent litigation could be costly  distracting to our management and time consuming 
third parties may allege that our products or services infringe their patents and other intellectual property rights  which could result in the payment of royalties 
payment of royalties would negatively affect our profits  furthermore  if we chose to contest these allegations  we could be subject to costly and time consuming litigation or could lose the ability to continue to sell the related products 
third parties may seek to invalidate or otherwise challenge our patents 
we may initiate litigation to enforce or defend our patents or intellectual property rights  however  litigation can be time consuming  distracting to our operations  costly and may not conclude favorably 
in addition  the outcome of patent infringement litigation often is difficult to predict 
if we are unsuccessful with respect to any future legal action in the defense of our patents and our patents are invalidated or determined to be unenforceable  our business could be negatively impacted 
even if our patents are not determined to be invalid or unenforceable  it is possible that a competitor could circumvent our patents by effectively designing around the claims of our patents 
accordingly  our patents may not provide us with any competitive advantage 
to the extent third party patents for which we currently do not hold licenses cover our products or services  licenses to these patents would be necessary to manufacture  use  sell or provide these products and services without infringing these patents 
in the case of products or services that utilize intellectual property of strategic collaborators or other suppliers  such suppliers may have an obligation to secure the needed license to these patents at their cost 
otherwise  we would be responsible for the cost of these licenses 
payments of royalties and other amounts under these licenses would reduce our profits from the sale of related products and services 
moreover  we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to alter the design of the product alleged to be infringed to avoid infringing a third party patent  we would be unable to continue to manufacture or sell the related products 
if a third party commences legal action against us for infringement  we could be compelled to incur significant costs to defend the action and our management attention could be diverted  whether 
table of contents or not the action were to have any merit 
we cannot be certain that we could prevail in the action  and an adverse judgment or settlement resulting from the action could require us to pay substantial amounts in damages for infringement or substantial amounts to obtain a license to continue to use the intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim 
we may not maintain adequate insurance coverage to protect us against significant product liability claims 
the testing  manufacturing  marketing  and sale of drugs and diagnostics involve product liability risks 
we may not be able to maintain our current product liability insurance at an acceptable cost  if at all 
in addition  our insurance coverage may not be adequate for all potential claims 
if claims or losses significantly exceed our liability insurance coverage  we may experience financial hardship or be forced out of business 
if we fail to attract and retain key management and qualified scientific and technical personnel  we may not be able to achieve our business objectives 
members of our management team  including our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
martine rothblatt  and our president and chief operating officer  dr 
roger jeffs  play a critical role in defining our business strategy and maintaining our corporate culture 
the loss of the services and leadership of dr 
rothblatt  dr 
jeffs or any other members of our senior management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on our senior management team members 
in addition  effective succession planning is important to our long term success 
failure to identify and retain adequate replacements for members of our senior management team and ensure effective transfer of knowledge could hinder the achievement of our business objectives 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific and technical personnel 
competition for skilled scientific and technical personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense 
our compensation arrangements may not be sufficient to attract new qualified scientific and technical employees or retain existing scientific and technical employees 
if we fail to attract and retain such employees  we may not be successful in developing and commercializing new therapies for pah and other diseases and conditions 
improper handling of hazardous materials used in our activities could expose us to significant remediation liabilities 
our research and development and manufacturing activities involve the controlled use of chemicals and hazardous substances and we are expanding these activities in both scale and location 
in addition  patients may dispose of our products using means we do not control 
such activities subject us to numerous federal  state  and local environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern the management  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations can require significant costs  furthermore  we can be subject to substantial fines and penalties in the event of noncompliance 
the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
furthermore  once chemical and hazardous materials leave our facilities  we cannot control what our hazardous waste removal contractors choose to do with these materials 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for substantial civil damages or costs associated with the cleanup of the release of hazardous materials 
any related liability could exceed our resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may encounter substantial difficulties managing our growth relative to product demand 
we have spent considerable resources building and expanding our offices  laboratories and production facilities  and we are currently seeking regulatory approvals for some of our facilities 
however  our facilities may be insufficient to meet future demand for our products 
alternatively  we 
table of contents may have excess capacity at our facilities if future demand falls short of our expectations  or if we do not receive regulatory approvals for the products we intend to produce at our facilities 
constructing our facilities is expensive and our ability to satisfactorily recover our investment will depend on sales of the products manufactured at these facilities in sufficient volume 
if we do experience substantial sales growth  we may have difficulty managing inventory levels as marketing new therapies is complicated and gauging future demand can be difficult and uncertain 
if we need additional financing and cannot obtain it  our product development and sales efforts may be limited 
we may be required to seek additional sources of financing to meet unplanned or planned expenditures 
unplanned expenditures could be significant and may result from necessary modifications to product development plans or product offerings in response to difficulties encountered with clinical trials 
we may also face unexpected costs in preparing products for commercial sale  or in maintaining sales levels of our currently marketed therapeutic products 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may be compelled to delay clinical studies  curtail operations or obtain funds through collaborative arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain products or potential markets 
we may require additional financing to meet significant future obligations 
for example  upon maturity or conversion of our percent convertible senior notes due september  convertible notes  subject to certain provisions  we must repay our investors in cash up to the principal balance of million 
further  in certain circumstances constituting a fundamental change under the convertible notes  we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes for cash 
in addition  awards granted under our share tracking awards plans which we collectively refer to as the stap entitle participants to receive in cash an amount equal to the appreciation in the price of our common stock  which is calculated as the positive difference between the closing price of our common stock on the date of exercise and the date of grant 
consequently  our stap will likely require significant future cash payments to participants to the extent the price of our common stock appreciates and the number of vested stap awards increases over time 
if we do not have sufficient funds to meet such contractual obligations or the ability to secure alternative sources of financing  we could be in default  face litigation and or lose key employees  which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability  which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 
in the ordinary course of our business  we collect and store sensitive data  including intellectual property  our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers  customers and business partners  and personally identifiable information 
the secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy 
despite our security measures  our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error  malfeasance or other disruptions 
any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed  publicly disclosed  lost or stolen 
any such access  disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings  liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information  disrupt our operations  and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents risks related to our common stock the price of our common stock can be highly volatile and may decline 
the price of common stock can be highly volatile within the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector 
consequently  there can be significant price and volume fluctuations in the market that may not relate to operating performance 
the following table sets forth the high and low closing prices of our common stock for the periods indicated high low january  december  january  december  january  december  the price of our common stock could decline sharply due to the following factors  among others failure to meet estimates or expectations of securities analysts or our own revenue guidance  quarterly and annual financial results  timing of enrollment and results of our clinical trials  physician  patient  investor or public concerns regarding the efficacy and or safety of products marketed or being developed by us or by others  changes in  or new legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement of  our therapeutic products by medicare  medicaid or other government payers  and changes in reimbursement policies of private health insurance companies  announcements by us or others of technological innovations or new products or announcements regarding our existing products  including in particular the development of new  competing pah therapies  announcements by us or others regarding generic challenges to the intellectual property relating to our products  including the recent abbreviated new drug applications filed by sandoz relating to certain of our remodulin patents and to our pending lawsuit defending our patents rights  substantial sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders  future issuances of common stock by us or any other activity which could be viewed as being dilutive to our shareholders  rumors among  or incorrect statements by  investors and or analysts concerning our company  our products  or operations  failure to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals from the fda or international regulatory agencies  discovery of previously unknown problems with our marketed products  or problems with our production  regulatory  compliance  promotional  marketing or sales activities that result in regulatory restrictions on our products  including withdrawal of our products from the market  accumulation of significant short positions in our common stock by hedge funds or other investors or the significant accumulation of our common stock by hedge funds or other institutional investors with investment strategies that may lead to short term holdings  and general market conditions 

table of contents we may fail to meet our own projected revenues  as well as third party projections for our revenues or profits 
many securities analysts publish quarterly and annual projections of our revenues and profits 
in addition  we provide forward looking guidance for revenues associated with our commercial products 
such estimates are inherently subject to uncertainty 
as a result  actual revenues and profits may differ from these projections  and even small variations in reported revenues and profits compared to securities analysts expectations or our own projected revenues could have a significant impact on the price of our common stock 
sales or issuances of our common stock may depress our stock price 
the price of our common stock could decline if we issue common stock to raise capital or to acquire a license or business  our shareholders transfer ownership of our common stock  or sell substantial amounts in the public market for example  in  lilly sold a significant portion of our common stock  our investors become concerned that substantial sales of our common stock may occur  or we issue shares upon the settlement of warrants relating to the hedging transaction for our convertible notes 
a decrease in the price of our common stock could make it difficult for us to raise capital or fund acquisitions through the issuance of our stock 
any sales of common stock issued to holders of our convertible notes could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock or result in short selling by market participants in expectation of a decline in the price of our common stock 
our share repurchases may affect the value of our common stock 
recently  our board of directors authorized several programs to repurchase our common stock 
the effect of any of these repurchase programs on the market price of our common stock will depend in part on market conditions 
we are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transaction 
the counterparty to the convertible note hedge transaction we entered into in connection with the issuance of our convertible notes call options will subject us to counterparty risk in that the counterparty may default on fulfilling potential obligations under the call options 
our exposure to the credit risk of the counterparty will not be secured by any collateral 
recent global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions 
if such counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings  we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim based on our exposure at that time under the call options 
our exposure will depend on many factors but  generally  the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the volatility of our common stock 
in addition  upon a default by the counterparty  we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock due to our obligation to deliver shares upon conversion of the notes 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the financial stability or viability of the counterparty to our convertible note hedge transaction 

table of contents provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  second amended and restated by laws  shareholder rights plan  convertible notes  convertible note hedge transaction and employment and license agreements  among other things  could prevent or delay a change of control or change in management that may be beneficial to our public shareholders 
certain provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  second amended and restated by laws and shareholder rights plan may prevent  delay or discourage a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  the assumption of control by a holder of a large block of our securities  and or the replacement or removal of current management by our shareholders 
for example  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes 
members of each class are elected for staggered three year terms 
this provision may make it more difficult for shareholders to replace the majority of directors 
it may also deter the accumulation of large blocks of our common stock by limiting the voting power of such blocks 
non competition and all other restrictive covenants in most of our employment agreements will terminate upon a change of control that is not approved by our board 
we may be required to repurchase the convertible notes from their holders in the event of a fundamental change and increase the conversion rate in connection with a make whole adjustment event in certain circumstances  including a change of control of our company 
this may delay or prevent a change in control of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to our shareholders 
terminating or unwinding the convertible note hedge transaction could require us to make substantial payments to the counterparty or may increase the price of our common stock 
the costs or any increase in stock price that may arise from terminating or unwinding the transaction could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser 
similarly  a change of control  under certain circumstances  could also result in an acceleration of the vesting of outstanding stap awards 
this  together with any increase in our stock price resulting from the announcement of a change of control  could make an acquisition of our company significantly more expensive to the purchaser 
we also have a broad based change of control severance program  under which employees may be entitled to severance benefits in the event they are terminated without cause or they terminate their employment for good reason following a change of control 
this program could also increase the cost of acquiring our company 
we enter into certain license agreements that generally prohibit our counterparties or their affiliates from taking necessary steps to acquire or merge with us  directly or indirectly throughout the term of these agreements  plus a specified period thereafter 
we are also party to certain license agreements that restrict our ability to assign or transfer the rights licensed to us to third parties  including parties with whom we wish to merge  or those attempting to acquire us 
these agreements often require that we obtain the prior consent of the counterparties to these agreements if we are contemplating a change of control 
if these counterparties withhold their consent  related agreements could be terminated and we would lose related license rights 
for example  both lilly and toray have the right to terminate our license agreements relating to adcirca and beraprost  respectively  in the event of certain change of control transactions 
these restrictive change of control provisions could impede or prevent mergers that could benefit our shareholders 

table of contents because we do not intend to pay cash dividends  our shareholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment in us 
we have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock 
furthermore  we do not intend to pay cash dividends in the future 
as a result  the return on an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon the future appreciation in the price of our common stock 
there can be no assurances that our common stock will provide a return to investors

overview our key therapeutic products and product candidates include prostacyclin analogues remodulin  tyvaso  oral treprostinil  d  transcon treprostinil and transcon beraprost stable synthetic forms of prostacyclin  an important molecule produced by the body that has powerful effects on blood vessel health and function  phosphodiesterase type pde inhibitor adcirca a molecule that acts to inhibit the degradation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp in cells 
cgmp is activated by nitric oxide no  a naturally occurring substance in the body that mediates the relaxation of vascular smooth muscle  monoclonal antibodies for oncologic applications ch mab and h mab antibodies that treat cancer by activating the immune system  glycobiology antiviral agents a novel class of small  sugar like molecules that have shown antiviral activity in a range of pre clinical settings  cell based therapy a cell based product known as placental expanded plx cells we are studying for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension  and engineered lungs and lung tissue for transplantation using xenotransplantation technology  as well as several regenerative medicine technologies  we are in the early pre clinical stage of developing engineered lungs and lung tissue which can be transplanted to patients suffering from pah and other lung diseases 
we concentrate substantially all of our research and development efforts on these key therapeutic programs 
our lead product is remodulin treprostinil injection remodulin for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
the united states food and drug administration fda initially approved remodulin in for subcutaneous under the skin administration 
the fda subsequently broadened its approval of remodulin in for intravenous in the vein use and for the treatment of patients requiring transition from flolan epoprostenol sodium for injection  the first drug approved by the fda for the treatment of pah 
remodulin has also been approved largely for subcutaneous use in various countries outside of the united states  however  in december  we received regulatory approval by the french regulatory agency  l agence nationale de s curit du m dicament et des produits de sant ansm  for the intravenous use of remodulin to treat pah 
the ansm approval followed a review period during which european economic area member nations  each of which had previously approved subcutaneous remodulin through the mutual recognition process  reviewed and endorsed the final variation assessment report issued by ansm  which will allow 
table of contents us to market intravenous remodulin in those countries following pricing approval and approval of our risk management plan in each country 
our other commercial products include tyvaso treprostinil inhalation solution tyvaso and adcirca tadalafil tablets adcirca 
in  the fda approved adcirca  an orally administered therapy for the treatment of pah to which we acquired exclusive us commercialization rights from eli lilly and company lilly 
in  we received fda approval of tyvaso  an inhaled therapy for the treatment of pah 
we launched both of these products for commercial sale in as compared with remodulin  these two products enable us to offer treatments to a broader range of patients who suffer from pah 
in addition  we are developing an oral  extended release tablet oral treprostinil and an extended release injectable form of treprostinil  both for the treatment of pah 
we are also developing an oral formulation of the prostacyclin analogue beraprost  which we refer to as d  and an extended release injection we refer to as transcon beraprost  both for the treatment of pah 
revenues sales of remodulin comprise the largest share of our revenues 
in addition  sales of both tyvaso and adcirca continue to become increasingly prominent sources of our revenues since their commercial introduction in we sell remodulin and tyvaso in the united states to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors accredo health group  inc accredo  curascript  inc 
curascript and cvs caremark caremark 
to date  the april acquisition of medco health solutions the parent company of accredo by express scripts  inc the parent company of curascript has not affected our business 
in addition to marketing in the united states  we also sell remodulin to distributors internationally 
adcirca is sold to pharmaceutical wholesalers that are part of lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
we increase the price of tyvaso from time to time 
most recently  we increased the price at which we sell tyvaso to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors by percent effective january  in addition  since receiving fda approval of adcirca  lilly has generally increased the net wholesale price of adcirca twice per year 
most recently  lilly informed us that the wholesale price of adcirca would be increased by percent effective january  under our agreement with lilly  lilly has the right to determine the price at which we sell adcirca 
we require our specialty pharmaceutical distributors to maintain reasonable levels of inventory reserves at all times as the interruption of remodulin or tyvaso therapy can be life threatening 
consequently  sales of these therapies in any given quarter may not precisely reflect patient demand 
our specialty pharmaceutical distributors typically place monthly orders based on estimates of future demand and considerations of contractual minimum inventory requirements 
as a result  sales volumes of remodulin and tyvaso can vary  depending on the timing and magnitude of these orders 
the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act collectively  the acts  contains broad provisions that will be implemented over the next several years 
we continue to evaluate the impact of the acts on our business  however  our evaluation is dependent upon the issuance of final regulations and the impact this legislation will have on insurance companies and their relationships with drug manufacturers 
in january  certain provisions of the acts that address the coverage gap in the medicare part d prescription drug program commonly known as the donut hole became effective 
under these provisions  drug manufacturers are required to provide a percent discount on branded prescription drugs to patients receiving reimbursement under medicare part d while they remain in this coverage gap 
these provisions of the acts apply to adcirca  which is our only commercial pharmaceutical product covered by medicare part d 
approximately percent of our adcirca patients are covered under medicare part d 
the vast majority of our remodulin and tyvaso medicare patients are covered under medicare part b  which does not contain a similar coverage gap 

table of contents the acts have not had a material impact on our business since their enactment  and we have not yet identified any provisions of the acts that could have a material impact on our business in the future 
however  the potential long term impact of the acts on our business is inherently difficult to predict  as many details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not yet been determined 
total revenues are reported net of estimated rebates  prompt pay discounts  allowances for sales returns  and distributor fees 
we estimate our liability for rebates based on an analysis of historical levels of rebates by product to both state medicaid agencies and commercial third party payers relative to sales of each product 
in addition  we determine our obligation for prescription drug discounts required for medicare part d patients within the coverage gap based on estimations of the number of medicare part d patients and the period such patients will remain within the coverage gap 
we provide prompt pay discounts to customers that pay amounts due within a specific time period and base our estimates for prompt pay discounts on observed historical customer payment behavior 
we derive estimates relating to the allowance for returns of adcirca from published industry data specific to specialty pharmaceuticals and will continue to do so until we have sufficient historical data on which to base our allowance 
we also compare patient prescription data for adcirca to sales of adcirca on a quarterly basis to ensure a reasonable relationship between prescription and sales trends 
to date  we have not identified any unusual patterns in the volume of prescriptions relative to sales that would warrant reconsideration of  or adjustment to  the methodology we currently employ to estimate our allowance for returns 
the allowance for exchanges for remodulin is based on the historical rate of product exchanges  which has been immaterial 
tyvaso is distributed under similar contractual terms as remodulin and the level of product exchanges for tyvaso has been less than that of remodulin 
as such  we do not record reserves for exchanges for either remodulin or tyvaso 
furthermore  we anticipate minimal exchange activity in the future for both products 
lastly  we estimate distributor fees based on contractual rates for specific services applied to the estimated units of service provided for the period 
cost of product sales cost of product sales is comprised of costs to produce and acquire products sold to customers  royalty payments under license agreements granting us rights to sell related products  and direct and indirect distribution costs incurred in the sale of products 
we acquired the rights to sell our commercial products through license and assignment agreements with the original developers of these products 
these agreements obligate us to pay royalties based on our net revenues from related products 
while the royalties vary by agreement  we pay aggregate royalties on each of our current commercial products ranging from five percent to ten percent of net revenues 
we synthesize treprostinil using advanced intermediate compounds purchased in bulk from several third party vendors that have the capacity to produce greater quantities of these compounds more cost effectively than we do 
our synthesis process has been designed to give us the flexibility to produce the forms of treprostinil used in remodulin  tyvaso  and oral treprostinil tablets  based on forecasted demand for each of these products 
we maintain inventories of remodulin and tyvaso equivalent to at least two years of expected demand to ensure sufficient availability of these products at all times 
we have reduced our target inventory levels from three years to two years in light of the approval of additional production sites for remodulin and tyvaso  including our own facilities which we expect will become our primary sources of supply  as these developments have helped mitigate the risk of shortages 
in  we amended our contract with our remodulin producer  baxter pharmaceutical solutions  llc baxter  to extend the contract term through during the fourth quarter of  we notified baxter that we will not renew our current contract when it expires at the end of however  we expect to negotiate and enter into a new contract with baxter before the expiration of the current contract 
as part of the amendment  we agreed that baxter will formulate remodulin in 
table of contents greater quantities using larger capacity equipment 
this new process and related equipment will require fda and international regulatory approval 
until fda approval of the new process and equipment  baxter will continue to formulate remodulin through using previously approved processes and equipment 
if the validation and stability testing of the new process and equipment are successful  we anticipate filing for regulatory approval of the new equipment and process shortly after entering into a new contract with baxter 
in january  we received fda approval of jubilant hollister stier contract manufacturing and services as an additional large capacity producer of remodulin 
in addition  in march and july of  we received fda approval to use our silver spring  maryland facility for the formulation of tyvaso and remodulin  respectively 
in june  we received a good manufacturing practice certificate from the uk medicines and health products regulatory agency to produce remodulin and tyvaso in our silver spring facility 
catalent pharma solutions  inc catalent also formulates tyvaso for us 
we intend to use our own facilities to produce our primary supply of remodulin and tyvaso  and we intend to contract with third parties to supplement our production capacity 
we acquired all the assets used to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system from nebu tec international med products eike kern gmbh nebu tec in we currently manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system in germany using labor supplied by nebu tec 
in addition  we received fda approval in december for minnetronix  inc to manufacture the tyvaso inhalation system and for quality tech services  inc to package daily supplies 
in july  we received fda approval for a modified tyvaso inhalation system based on the results of the completion of certain post marketing commitments relating to the inhalation device 
as a result  we are currently manufacturing the modified inhalation device td  which we expect to release commercially during consequently  as of december   we increased our reserves for inventory obsolescence by million based on the estimated cost of inhalation device inventory we do not expect to be salable as a result of the commercial release of td under the terms of our manufacturing and supply agreement with lilly  lilly manufactures adcirca and distributes the product on our behalf via its pharmaceutical wholesaler network  in the same manner that it distributes its own pharmaceutical products 
we take title to adcirca upon its manufacture by lilly and bear any losses related to the distribution and sale of adcirca 
operating expenses since our inception  we have devoted substantial resources to our various research and development initiatives 
accordingly  we incur considerable costs related to our clinical trials and other research and development efforts  which are conducted both internally and through third parties on a variety of projects to develop pharmaceutical products 
from time to time  we also license or acquire additional technologies and compounds to be incorporated into our development pipeline 
our operating expenses are often materially impacted by the recognition of share based compensation expense benefit associated with our share tracking award plans stap and stock option grants containing a performance requirement 
compensation expense associated with our stock purchase plan has thus far been insignificant 
stap awards  which are classified as liabilities  must be measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period until the awards are no longer outstanding 
changes in the fair value of stap awards are recorded as an adjustment to share based compensation expense benefit 
the fair value of equity based awards is measured using inputs and assumptions under the black scholes merton model that can materially impact the amount of compensation expense benefit for a given period 
additionally  some or all of the following factors  among others  can cause substantial volatility in the amount of share based compensation expense benefit recognized in connection with the stap from period to period changes in the price of our common stock  changes in the number of outstanding awards  and changes in both the number of vested awards and the number of awards that have accrued toward vesting 
stock options granted to our chief 
table of contents executive officer  in accordance with the criteria set forth in her employment contract  vest immediately upon grant 
we accrue for estimated compensation expense associated with stap awards and stock option grants containing performance based conditions affecting vesting when we determine that it is probable that performance criteria will be met 
each of these factors may cause significant volatility in our operating expenses from quarter to quarter 
major research and development projects our major research and development projects focus on the use of prostacyclin analogues and other therapies  as well as regenerative and xenotransplantation technologies  to treat cardiopulmonary diseases  monoclonal antibodies to treat a variety of cancers  and glycobiology antiviral agents to treat infectious diseases 
cardiopulmonary disease projects remodulin a majority of the patients who die of pah in the united states each year have not initiated treatment with an infused prostacyclin analogue  which is a complex and burdensome form of medical therapy 
in  we entered into an agreement with medtronic  inc medtronic to develop its synchromed implantable pump to deliver remodulin  which  if successful  could eliminate many of the patient burdens associated with infused prostacyclins 
medtronic commenced a clinical trial administering remodulin using the synchromed in april to support fda approval for the use of remodulin with an implantable pump 
patient enrollment in the clinical trial was completed in late november based on current projections of patient days and discontinuations  we expect that the clinical trial will be completed in late in certain countries in europe  an implantable pump distributed by omt gmbh co 
kg is used to deliver intravenous remodulin to certain patients 
tyvaso the fda approved tyvaso for the treatment of pah in  and we launched the product for commercial sale later that year 
in connection with the tyvaso approval  we agreed to a post marketing requirement pmr and certain post marketing commitments pmcs 
pmrs and pmcs often obligate sponsors to conduct studies after fda approval to gather additional information about a product safety  efficacy  or optimal use 
pmrs are required studies  whereas pmcs are voluntary commitments 
in september  the fda notified us that we had fulfilled the requirements of the pmcs 
in july  we received fda approval for a modified tyvaso inhalation system td based on the results of the pmcs 
as a result  we are currently manufacturing the td  which we expect to release commercially during we are working to further improve the tyvaso inhalation system to make it easier for patients to use 
if ultimately approved by the fda  an improved tyvaso inhalation system could enhance patient convenience and potentially increase the number of patients using tyvaso 
in accordance with our pmr  we enrolled patients in a long term observational study in the united states that included  patient years of follow up in patients treated with tyvaso  and  patient years of follow up in control patients receiving other pah treatments 
this study will allow us to continue assessing the safety of tyvaso 
we are required to provide the fda with annual updates on our pmr  and to submit the results of the study by december  while we believe we are on schedule to complete the pmr by this deadline  any failure or delay could result in penalties  including fines or withdrawal of tyvaso from the market  unless we are able to demonstrate good cause for the failure or delay 

table of contents we are not seeking european medicines agency ema approval of tyvaso for the treatment of pah 
we expect to make tyvaso available in certain european and latin american countries in on an unmarketed  named patient basis through country specific arrangements with our distributors  to the extent physicians prescribe tyvaso in those countries 
oral treprostinil we are developing a novel salt form of treprostinil for oral administration  treprostinil diolamine tablets 
in december  we submitted to the fda an nda for the approval of oral treprostinil for treatment of pah 
our nda included the results of three phase iii studies combination therapy studies freedom c and freedom c two separate week studies of patients on approved background therapy using a pde inhibitor  such as revatio  or an etra  such as tracleer  or a combination of both 
the freedom c and freedom c trials were completed in and respectively  and neither achieved statistical significance for its primary endpoint of improvement in six minute walk distance at week p and p  respectively 
monotherapy study freedom m a week study of pah patients who were not on any approved background therapy 
in june  we announced that the freedom m trial met its primary endpoint of improvement in six minute walk distance at week analysis of the freedom m results demonstrated that patients receiving oral treprostinil improved their six minute walk distance by a median of approximately meters p  hodges lehmann estimate and non parametric analysis of covariance in accordance with the trial pre specified statistical analysis plan as compared to patients receiving placebo 
the median change from baseline at week was meters for patients receiving oral treprostinil and meters for patients receiving placebo 
we believe that patients in the freedom c and freedom c trials needed longer term treatment with oral treprostinil to provide a statistically significant clinical trial outcome 
as such  we began enrolling patients in a new phase iii clinical trial freedom ev in the third quarter of freedom ev is a placebo controlled study of newly diagnosed patients who have initiated an approved background therapy either an etra or a pde inhibitor  but not both  with one co primary endpoint being the time to clinical worsening  generally defined as death  an unplanned hospitalization due to pah  initiation of prostacyclin for the treatment of pah  a decrease in six minute walk distance of at least percent from baseline or too ill to walk as a result of the progression of pah  or unsatisfactory long term clinical response 
the other co primary endpoint is change in six minute walk distance at week we plan to enroll up to patients in order to observe clinical worsening events 
on october   the fda issued a complete response letter in which it declined to approve our nda 
in january  we filed a resubmission of our nda in response to the concerns raised in the fda complete response letter 
the fda has acknowledged our resubmission as complete and set a targeted response date of march  despite the fda complete response letter and uncertainty as to whether our resubmission will be approved  we remain committed to further studying oral treprostinil and seeking fda approval before the end of we currently expect to seek approval of oral treprostinil in europe upon completion of the freedom ev study 
in  the ema announced that oral treprostinil had been designated an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of pah 
self injectable prostacyclin analogues in september  we announced that we signed an exclusive agreement with ascendis pharma a s ascendis pharma to apply ascendis pharma proprietary transcon technology platform to our 
table of contents treprostinil molecule 
we believe that the transcon technology platform may enable a sustained release of a novel  carrier linked product  which will significantly enhance the delivery of treprostinil by establishing a once daily  self injectable alternative for patients who currently administer remodulin through a continuous infusion pump for the treatment of pah 
we expect that this self injectable form of treprostinil could enable patients to avoid the infusion site pain associated with subcutaneous remodulin 
under this agreement  we also intend to pursue development of a transcon technology enabled sustained release formulation of beraprost  which is another prostacyclin analogue  as discussed below 
d and transcon beraprost in july  we entered into an exclusive license agreement with toray industries  inc toray to amend and replace our existing license agreement regarding the development of an orally administered  modified release formulation of the prostacyclin analogue beraprost beraprost mr  for the treatment of pah 
terms of the july license agreement did not materially change from the previous license agreement and license agreement supplements  except for a reduction in royalty rates 
in exchange for the reduction in royalty rates  we agreed to pay toray million in equal  non refundable payments over a five year period ending in in november  we announced that a phase ii trial of beraprost mr did not provide data supporting the initiation of a phase iii study using a twice daily dosing regimen 
the results of this study suggested that the efficacy of beraprost may be improved by providing more stable and consistent plasma concentrations of beraprost 
therefore  we commenced studies of a reformulated  single isomer version of the drug d  with a dosing regimen of four times per day 
we completed a phase i safety trial in july  and the preliminary data suggested that dosing d four times a day was safe 
we believe that d and treprostinil bind selectively to different sets of prostacyclin receptors within the lung and thus could provide certain groups of patients a differing set of safety and efficacy profiles 
currently  we are developing a phase iii study to evaluate the clinical benefit of d as an add on therapy to tyvaso 
during the third quarter of  we initiated efforts to develop an extended release injection we refer to as transcon beraprost  which incorporates the transcon technology described above and is intended to be self administered by pah patients once daily 
cell based therapy in june  we entered into a license agreement with pluristem ltd 
pluristem to develop and commercialize a cell based product for the treatment of pah using pluristem proprietary cell technology known as placental expanded plx cells 
we are currently conducting preclinical toxicology and pharmacology studies to support a potential investigational new drug application for the treatment of pah  and expect to commence a phase i clinical study in australia in the first half of engineered lungs and lung tissue for transplantation pah has not been reported to reoccur in end stage patients who have received a full lung transplant 
only a few hundred pah patients receive a lung transplantation each year due to the shortage of available lungs for transplant and the demand for transplantable lungs by patients with end stage pulmonary disease  such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis 
in july  we acquired all of the outstanding stock of revivicor  inc revivicor  a company focused on developing genetic biotechnology platforms to provide alternative tissue sources for treatment of human degenerative disease through tissue and organ xenotransplantation 
we acquired revivicor to pursue early stage development of replacement lungs for transplantation 
for further 
table of contents details concerning the revivicor acquisition  see note acquisitions to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  we are also engaged in preclinical development of several regenerative medicine technologies for creating transplantable lung tissue and whole lungs for patients with end stage lung disease 
collagen type v in february  lung llc entered into a development agreement with immuneworks  inc immuneworks to develop iw  a purified bovine derived from cows type v collagen oral solution for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  a progressive lung disease characterized by abnormal and excessive deposition of fibrotic tissue in the lung  and primary graft dysfunction  a type of organ rejection in patients receiving lung transplant 
we terminated the development agreement effective november  following a review of the results of a phase i clinical trial of iw from inception to december   we have spent million on all of our current and former cardiopulmonary disease programs 
cancer related projects ch antibody in july  we entered into a cooperative research and development agreement crada with the national cancer institute nci of the united states national institutes for health to collaborate on the late stage development and regulatory approval process for chimeric monoclonal antibody ch for children with high risk neuroblastoma and patients with other forms of cancer 
ch is an antibody that has shown potential in the treatment of certain types of cancer by targeting gd  a glycolipid on the surface of tumor cells 
under the terms of the crada  nci has completed a second phase iii clinical trial in patients to define more clearly the safety and toxicity profile of ch immunotherapy in children  and we are developing the commercial production capability for the antibody 
as part of developing our commercial production capability  we will need to demonstrate comparability of our ch to the nci produced ch  which typically includes a series of analytical and bioanalytical assays and human pharmacokinetics 
the human pharmacokinetics study is currently open for enrollment in the united states 
the nci studies  including a previously conducted phase iii clinical trial and all other necessary studies supported by nci  will be used as the basis for a biologics license application we expect to file seeking fda approval of ch immunotherapy for the treatment of neuroblastoma and a marketing authorization application we expect to file with the ema for approval in europe 
we have received orphan drug designation for ch from the fda and the ema 
h antibody pursuant to a agreement with memorial sloan kettering cancer center  we obtained certain license rights to an investigational monoclonal antibody  h  for the treatment of metastatic brain cancer 
h is a mouse igg mab that is highly reactive with a range of human solid tumors  including human brain cancers 
the h antibody is in early investigational development for metastases that develop in the brain from the spread of cancers from other tissues in the body 
metastatic brain cancers are ten times more common than cancers that originate in the brain  and prognosis for patients with metastatic brain cancers is very poor 
in the united states  more than  cases of metastatic brain cancer are diagnosed each year 
we have spent million from inception to december   on all of our current and former cancer programs 

table of contents infectious disease projects pursuant to our research agreement with the university of oxford oxford  we have the exclusive right to commercialize a platform of glycobiology antiviral drug candidates in various preclinical and clinical stages of testing for the treatment of a wide variety of viruses 
through our research agreement with oxford  we are also supporting research into new glycobiology antiviral drug candidates and technologies 
we are currently testing many of these compounds in preclinical studies and oxford continues to synthesize new agents that we may elect to test 
in september  we were awarded a cost plus fixed fee contract with an aggregate value of up to million under a broad agency announcement from the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid of the united states national institutes for health for studies directed at the development of a broad spectrum antiviral drug based on our glycobiology antiviral platform 
under the contract base period of forty two months  we will receive million in funding 
in addition  there are eight milestone based options to expand the project and funding under the contract 
in august  we received a contract modification exercising two of the above mentioned milestone based options  increasing total contract funding by million 
we recognize revenue under this contract to the extent of costs incurred  plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
we have spent million from inception to december   on all of our current and former infectious disease programs 
future prospects our future prospects are dependent on achieving some or all of the following objectives in the near term  continued revenue growth of our current commercial products by increasing our market share and launching enhancements designed to improve patient care  such as implantable pumps for remodulin  a once daily self injectable form of remodulin and continued enhancements to the tyvaso inhalation system  in the medium term  augmenting our near term product growth through a the approval and launch of oral prostacyclin analogues for use in combination with adcirca and other oral therapies at earlier stages of pah  and b commercial launch and sales of one or more of our antiviral drug candidates to the government and private sectors  and in the long term  supplementing our oral  inhaled and infused pah therapy revenues by introducing transplantable cells  tissues and organs that might provide successful treatment for pah and other patients facing end stage lung disease 
our ability to achieve these objectives and sustain our growth and profitability will depend on many factors including among others the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals for products we develop  the timing of the commercial launch of new products  the pricing of and demand for our products and services  the reimbursement of our products by public and private insurance organizations  the competition we face within our industry  our ability to effectively manage our growth in an increasingly complex regulatory environment  and our ability to defend against generic competition  including the ongoing challenge to our remodulin patents by a generic drug company 
as we develop our products in the future  we may need to construct additional facilities to support the development and commercialization of these products 
for example  the development of transplantable lungs and lung tissues through our xenotransplantation and regenerative medicine programs will require the design and construction of sophisticated facilities that will need to comply with the regulatory requirements related to these programs 
in addition  if we are successful with the development of any or all of our other developmental products  we may need to build additional facilities to support our expanding operations 
in  we will commence construction of certain facilities to in connection with our xenotransplantation and regenerative medicine programs 
the extent to which we develop such facilities will depend on the progress of our pre clinical development in these programs 

table of contents we operate in a highly competitive market in which a small number of pharmaceutical companies control a majority of the pah business 
these pharmaceutical companies not only possess more visibility in the market  but also possess greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
in addition  there are a number of investigational products in late stage development that  if approved  may erode the market share of our existing commercial therapies and make market acceptance more difficult to achieve for any therapies we may market in the future

in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of aggregate repurchases of our common stock repurchase program 
the repurchase program became effective for a one year period beginning july  in november  we completed the repurchase program by acquiring approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million 
on february   we announced that our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million in aggregate repurchases of our common stock from time to time at our discretion repurchase program 
repurchases under the repurchase program may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the repurchase program will become effective over a one year period beginning on march  and will be funded by cash generated from operations and existing cash and short term marketable investments 
toray license obligations pursuant to a march amendment to our license agreement for the development of beraprost mr  we issued  shares of our common stock to toray 
toray has the right to request that we repurchase these shares at their issuance price of per share upon days prior written notice 
the july amendment to the license agreement carried forward the original terms relating to these shares 
to date  toray has not notified us that it intends to require us to repurchase these shares 
as part of the july amendment to our license  we agreed to pay toray million in equal  non refundable payments over a five year period ending in in exchange for a reduction in royalty rates 
as of december   the undiscounted outstanding balance of this obligation was million 
obligations under license agreements under our existing license agreements  we are obligated to make royalty payments at a rate of ten percent of the net sales of remodulin and tyvaso once annual combined net sales of these products exceed million 
in addition  we pay lilly a five percent royalty on net sales of adcirca 
we have entered into other license rights arrangements under which we are required to make milestone payments upon the achievement of certain developmental and commercialization objectives and royalty payments upon the commercialization of related licensed technology

as of december   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits 
the contractual obligations disclosed above exclude these amounts due to the uncertainty surrounding the amounts and timing of future payments 
summary of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
as additional information becomes available  these estimates and assumptions may change and materially impact reported amounts 
we have identified the following accounting policies  which require the use of our judgment and estimation in their application 
we consider these policies to be critical because of the degree of judgment that is inherent in their application 

table of contents revenue recognition remodulin and tyvaso we sell both remodulin and tyvaso to our specialty pharmaceutical distributors under similar contractual arrangements 
sales of remodulin and tyvaso are recognized when title and risk of ownership pass to our distributors upon satisfactory delivery to our distributors facilities ie  when all of our performance obligations under these distributor arrangements have been satisfied 
we record sales of remodulin and tyvaso net of estimated rebates  prompt payment discounts and service fees to our distributors 
determining sales allowances involves the use of significant estimates and judgment and may involve the use of information from external sources 
we derive our provisions for rebates from an analysis of historical levels of rebates to both state medicaid agencies and commercial third party payers by product  relative to sales of each product 
in formulating our estimates  we also consider the impact of anticipated changes in product prices  sales trends and government rebate programs  particularly as they relate to eligibility requirements and or rebate pricing 
we analyze rebate data separately for remodulin and tyvaso  as these therapies have been developed to treat pah patients at different stages in the disease continuum and therefore  rebate eligibility and pricing requirements can differ for each therapy 
we estimate prompt pay discounts based on observed payment behavior 
our distributors have routinely taken advantage of these discounts and we expect them to continue to do so 
we pay our distributors for services rendered based on contractual rates applied to estimated units of service provided for a given financial reporting period 
our distributors do not have return rights  however  we provide exchange rights in the event that product is damaged during shipment  or expires 
exchanges for damaged product are highly infrequent 
in the event that remodulin or tyvaso has been damaged during shipment and we have been promptly notified as required under our distributor arrangements  we do not recognize revenue on that shipment until damaged product has been replaced 
replacement generally occurs within several days after we are notified of the damage 
the number of product exchanges due to expiration has been minimal because at any given time  we sell remodulin and tyvaso with expiration dates in excess of one year and our distributors typically carry a thirty to sixty day supply of related inventories at any given time 
in addition  we do not require  nor do we provide incentives for our distributors to assume inventory levels of remodulin or tyvaso beyond what would be considered reasonable and customary in the ordinary course of business and closely monitor inventory levels in the distribution channels 
the financial effects of exchange rights for remodulin and tyvaso have been immaterial and we expect the volume of exchanges to be consistent with historical levels 
specifically  exchanges for remodulin and tyvaso have comprised significantly less than one percent of the volume of units we sell 
because historical and anticipated future exchanges of remodulin and tyvaso have been  and are expected to be  immaterial  we do not recognize a reserve for estimated exchange rights in the period of sale 
lastly  we closely monitor exchange data for both of these therapies to ensure that our assumptions continue to be reasonable  appropriate and current 

table of contents adcirca adcirca is manufactured for us by lilly and distributed through lilly pharmaceutical wholesaler network 
specifically  lilly handles all of the administrative functions associated with the sale of adcirca on our behalf  including the receipt and processing of customer purchase orders  shipment of adcirca to customers  and the invoicing and collection of customer payments 
in addition  sales terms for adcirca include return rights that extend throughout the distribution channel 
we recognize sales of adcirca on a gross basis net of allowances upon delivery to customers due to the following factors we are responsible for the acceptability of the product purchased by wholesalers  we bear all inventory risk  as title and risk of loss pass to us at the shipping point from lilly manufacturing facility  we assume credit risk if lilly is unable to collect amounts due from customers  and we assume the risk and cost of a product recall  if required 
we recognize sales of adcirca net of estimated rebates including discounts required under medicare part d  prompt pay discounts  allowances for product returns  and wholesaler fees 
we estimate our liability for rebates based on an analysis of historical levels of rebates to both medicaid and commercial third party payers 
in addition  we determine our obligation for prescription drug discounts required for medicare part d patients within the coverage gap based on estimations of the number of medicare part d patients and the period such patients will remain within the coverage gap 
we base our estimates for prompt pay discounts on observed customer payment behavior and expectations regarding the future utilization of such discounts 
we derive estimates relating to the allowance for returns from published industry data specific to specialty pharmaceuticals and will continue to do so until we have sufficient historical data on which to base our allowance 
in addition  we compare patient prescription data for adcirca to sales of adcirca on a quarterly basis to ensure a reasonable relationship between prescription and sales trends 
to date  we have not identified any unusual patterns in the volume of prescriptions relative to sales that would warrant reconsideration of  or adjustment to  the methodology we currently employ to estimate our allowance for returns 
lastly  wholesaler fees are based on contractual percentages of wholesalers sales 
share based compensation our share based awards are classified as either equity stock options  stock purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan or as liabilities stap awards  and we recognize related share based compensation expense based on the fair value of awards 
we estimate the fair value of all share based awards using the black scholes merton valuation model 
valuation models  like the black scholes merton model  require the use of subjective assumptions that could materially impact the estimation of fair value and related compensation expense to be recognized 
these assumptions include  among others  the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of awards and the expected forfeiture rate 
developing these assumptions requires the use of judgment 
marketable investments substantially all of our marketable securities are classified as held to maturity 
for marketable investments in which the fair value is lower than the carrying value  we periodically review whether related impairments of these securities are other than temporary 
this review requires us to make judgments  particularly as they relate to the extent and duration of a decline in the fair value of a security  the probability  extent and timing of a recovery of a security value  our assessment as to whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a security prior to recovery of its amortized cost  and our estimation of the present value of the cash flows we would expect to collect that are attributable to an impaired debt security to determine whether a credit loss exists 
the scope of this evaluation requires forward looking assessments pertaining to a security and the relevant financial markets  an issuer financial condition and business outlook  and our estimation of the value of cash flows we would expect to collect from an issuer upon maturity of an impaired security 

table of contents accordingly  we must make assessments regarding current conditions and future events  which involve a considerable degree of uncertainty and judgment 
when we determine that the decline in value of a security is other than temporary  we are required to recognize the credit loss portion as a charge in our consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we classify substantially all of our marketable investments as held to maturity because we believe we have the positive intent and ability to hold related securities until they mature 
this assertion requires us to make forward looking judgments regarding our future cash flow requirements relative to the maturity dates of such securities 
to reduce the level of uncertainty associated in making this determination  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years 
fair value measurements we are required to disclose assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements within a specified fair value hierarchy 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to fair value measurements based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to fair value measurements derived through the use of unobservable inputs level measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy  in their entirety  based on the lowest level input that is significant to the related fair value measurement 
determining where a particular asset or liability should be disclosed within the hierarchy involves judgment regarding the significance of inputs relative to a fair value measurement and where such inputs lie within the hierarchy 
furthermore  assets and liabilities that are not actively traded may have little or no price transparency 
as such  estimating the fair value of level assets and liabilities involves the use of significant subjective assumptions that we believe market participants would consider in pricing 
we often employ a discounted cash flow model to help us estimate the fair value of our level assets and liabilities 
inputs to the model that involve a significant degree of judgment include estimating the amounts and timing of expected cash flows and determining a suitable discount rate 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with the asset and liability method 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
evaluating the realizability of deferred assets requires us to review forecasts of earnings and taxable income  among other considerations 
accordingly  the evaluation process as it relates to the realizability of deferred tax assets requires us to make significant judgments and forward looking assessments regarding the amounts and availability of future taxable income 
financial statement recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is determined based on a more likely than not threshold of that position being sustained 
if the tax position meets this threshold  the benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
accounting for uncertain tax positions involves considerable judgment in assessing the future tax consequences of amounts that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in amounts different from those recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents intangible assets and goodwill in connection with transactions that we account for as business combinations  we typically recognize intangible assets  based on their acquisition date fair value  and goodwill  representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred  over the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
measuring the acquisition date fair value of intangible assets involves the use of significant judgment and estimates with respect to determining  among other inputs the timing and amounts of cash flows and operating profits for potential product candidates  the timing and probability of regulatory approvals for product candidates under development  the useful lives of potential product candidates  and appropriate discount rates 
we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
evaluating goodwill for impairment requires judgment particularly as it relates to determining the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned 
we often use a discounted cash flow model to test goodwill for impairment  which involves the use of significant and subjective inputs 
inputs requiring our judgment include  among others  the estimation of the amounts and timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and profitability of a reporting unit 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could impact impairment analyses and require the recognition of an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value 
we test our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when conditions suggest that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
evaluating intangible assets for impairment requires judgment  particularly when determining amounts of undiscounted cash flows used in assessing recoverability and measuring the fair value of such assets  if necessary 
these projections require forward looking assumptions that may include  among others  estimates of future growth  discount rates and future business or industry conditions 
changes in our business strategy or adverse changes in market conditions could indicate one or more finite lived intangible assets have been impaired 
therefore  we would be initially required to test such assets for recoverability 
if determined unrecoverable  we would recognize an impairment charge equal to the extent the carrying value of such assets exceed their fair value 
pension benefit obligation accounting for our serp requires that we recognize in our consolidated balance sheet a liability equal to the unfunded status of the serp equal to the projected benefit obligation  as we do not fund the serp and measure our projected benefit obligation as of the end of our fiscal year 
estimating the serp obligation involves the use of judgment and estimates 
the serp obligation and related pension expense are derived from actuarial valuations that are developed using a number of assumptions 
a key assumption underlying the valuation is the discount rate 
the discount rate should be representative of the rate associated with high quality  fixed income debt securities 
with the prevailing economic conditions and outlook and the tightening of the credit markets that began in  interest rates  in general  have continued to decline 
we must consider these economic factors when determining an appropriate discount rate to employ 
consequently  the discount rate we use to measure our obligation has decreased 
changes in the discount rate can significantly increase or decrease our serp obligation 
for instance  a reduction in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation and result in an actuarial loss 
consequently  we could be required to recognize additional pension expense in our consolidated statements of operations related to the actuarial loss in future periods if certain thresholds are met 
other actuarial assumptions include participant demographics such as the expected rate of salary increases and withdrawal rates  among other factors 
not only can actual experience differ from actuarial assumptions  but changes in any of these assumptions can also materially affect the measurement of the serp obligation 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
instead  asu requires entities to report all non owner changes in stockholders equity in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income  or when an item must be reclassified to net income 
in december  the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassifications of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no 
asu 
asu defers indefinitely provisions contained in asu that revise existing presentation requirements for reclassification adjustments from comprehensive income as the fasb further deliberates this issue 
during the deferral period  reporting entities will continue to follow existing guidance prior to asu under asc topic  comprehensive income  with respect to the disclosure of reclassifications adjustments 
both asu and asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december   and asu requires retrospective application 
other than the presentational changes to our basic consolidated financial statements required under asu as amended by asu  adoption of asu did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asu no 
 comprehensive income topic reporting amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income asu 
asu provides guidance about disclosing reclassification adjustments  which was previously deferred for further deliberation by asu asu provides financial statement issuers the option to disclose significant amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income separately by each component in either a single note to the financial statements  or parenthetically on the face of the income statement for each line item s affected by the reclassification adjustment 
asu will be effective for all interim and annual financial statement reporting periods beginning after december   with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate the adoption of asu will have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we have invested million in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies 
the market value of these investments varies inversely with changes in current market interest rates 
in general  as interest rates increase  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to decrease 
conversely  as interest rates decrease  the market value of a debt investment would be expected to increase 
to address market risk  we invest in debt securities that mature within two years and hold these investments to maturity so that they can be redeemed at their stated or face value 
at december   our investments in debt securities issued by corporations and federally sponsored agencies had a weighted average stated interest rate of approximately percent and a weighted average maturity of year 
these investments mature at various times through and many are callable annually 
during sustained periods of instability and uncertainty in the financial markets  we could be exposed to additional investment related risks that could materially affect the value and liquidity of our investments 
in light of these risks  we actively monitor market conditions and developments specific to the securities and security classes in which we invest 
we believe that we maintain a conservative investment approach in that we invest exclusively in unstructured  highly rated securities with relatively short maturities that we believe reduce our exposure to undue risks 
while we believe we take prudent measures to mitigate investment related risks  such risks cannot be fully eliminated  as circumstances can occur that are beyond our control
