item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview in and  net income was million and million  respectively 
diluted earnings per share increased to or from to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to a one time income tax benefit of million related to and prior years for state income tax repairs and maintenance deductions that we recognized in  an unrealized pre tax gain of million on our benefit plan insurance investments  a one time benefit of deferred wram operating revenues of million and associated costs of million that we recognized in  a decrease in the current year income tax provision due to the repairs and maintenance deductions  and lower financing costs for short term borrowings  which was partially offset by a million reduction to operating revenues due to the cost of capital adjustment mechanism and cost increases for employee wages and benefits  water production costs  and depreciation on plant placed into service during net income was million in and diluted earnings per common share were in and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the diluted earnings per share calculation was  in and  in net income was the same in and because rate increases from the grc and corresponding approved rates were offset by increases to operating expenses  long term debt interest expense  and a reduction in net other income 
the grc and corresponding approved rates  and grcs filed in hawaii will increase authorized operating revenues 
the cost of capital adjustment mechanism ccam required a reduction to authorized operating revenues of million due to a decrease in the moody aa utility bond index as of september  compared to september  the ccam adjustment will reduce the authorized rate of return 
the grc will not increase authorized operating revenues until see discussion in regulatory matters section of this annual report 
we plan to continue to seek rate relief to recover our operating cost increases and receive reasonable returns on invested capital 
we expect to fund our long term capital needs through a combination of debt  common stock offerings  and cash flow from operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates we maintain our accounting records in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and as directed by the commissions to which our operations are subject 
the process of preparing financial statements requires the use of estimates on the part of management 
the estimates used by management are based on historic experience and an understanding of current facts and circumstances 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is listed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following sections describe those policies where the level of subjectivity  judgment  and variability of estimates could have a material impact on the financial condition  operating performance  and cash flows of the business 
revenue recognition revenue generally includes monthly cycle customer billings for regulated water and wastewater services at rates authorized by regulatory commissions plus an estimate for water used between the customer last meter reading and the end of the accounting period and billings to certain non regulated customers at rates authorized by contract with government agencies 
the company regulated water and waste water revenue requirements are authorized by the commissions in the states in which we operate 
the revenue requirements are intended to provide the company a reasonable opportunity to recover its cost of service and earn a return on investments 

table of contents for metered customers  cal water recognizes revenue from rates which are designed and authorized by the cpuc 
under the water revenue adjustment mechanism wram  cal water records the adopted level of volumetric revenues  which would include recovery of cost of service and a return on investments as established by the cpuc for metered accounts adopted volumetric revenues 
in addition to volumetric based revenues  the revenue requirements approved by the cpuc include service charges  flat rate charges  and other items not subject to the wram 
the adopted volumetric revenue considers the seasonality of consumption of water based upon historical averages 
the variance between adopted volumetric revenues and actual billed volumetric revenues for metered accounts is recorded as a component of revenue with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability balancing account tracked individually for each cal water district subject to certain criteria under the accounting for regulated operations being met 
the variance amount may be positive or negative and represents amounts that will be billed or refunded to customers in the future 
cost recovery rates are designed to permit full recovery of certain costs allowed to be recovered by the commissions 
cost recovery rates such as the modified cost balancing account mcba provides for recovery of adopted expense levels for purchased water  purchased power and pump taxes  as established by the cpuc 
in addition  cost recovery rates include recovery of cost related to water conservation programs and certain other operation expenses adopted by the cpuc 
variances which include the effects of changes in both rate and volume for the mcba between adopted and actual costs are recorded as a component of revenue  as the amount of such variances will be recovered from or refunded to our customers at a later date 
there is no profit associated with cost recovery expenses which are generally recognized when the expenses are incurred 
the balances in the wram and mcba assets and liabilities accounts will fluctuate on a monthly basis depending upon the variance between adopted and actual results 
the recovery or refund of the wram is netted against the mcba over or under recovery for the corresponding district and is interest bearing at the current day commercial paper rate 
at the end of the calendar year  cal water files with the cpuc to refund or collect the balance in the accounts 
on april   the cpuc issued a decision to shorten the amortization periods for cal water undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances 
as a result of the decision  most balances are collected over and months 
cal water defers any net wram and mcba revenues and associated costs whenever the net receivable balances are estimated to be collected more than months after the respective reporting period in which it was recorded 
cal water excluded net wram and mcba revenues of million  associated costs of million  and the related million of net operating income before income taxes as of december  due to the net receivable balances estimated to be collected more than months 
the deferred net wram and mcba revenue and associated costs were determined using forecasts of rate payer consumption trends in future reporting periods and the timing of when the cpuc will authorize cal water filings to recover unbilled balances 
deferred revenues and associated costs are recorded in future periods as the collection becomes within months of the respective reporting period 

table of contents the net wram and mcba balances included in regulatory assets and liabilities as of december  and are dollars in millions net short term receivable net long term receivable total receivable net short term payable net long term payable total payable flat rate customers are billed in advance at the beginning of the service period 
the revenue is prorated so that the portion of revenue applicable to the current period is included in that period revenue  with the balance recorded as unearned revenue on the balance sheet and recognized as revenue when earned in the subsequent accounting period 
our unearned revenue liability was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this liability is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
regulated utility accounting because we operate extensively in a regulated business  we are subject to the accounting standards for regulated utilities 
the commissions in the states in which we operate establish rates that are designed to permit the recovery of the cost of service and a return on investment 
we capitalize and record regulatory assets for costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if it is probable that the incurred costs will be recovered in future rates 
regulatory assets are amortized over the future periods that the costs are expected to be recovered 
if costs expected to be incurred in the future are currently being recovered through rates  we record those expected future costs as regulatory liabilities 
in addition  we record regulatory liabilities when the commissions require a refund to be made to our customers over future periods 
determining probability requires significant judgment by management and includes  but is not limited to  consideration of testimony presented in regulatory hearings  proposed regulatory decisions  final regulatory orders  and the strength or status of applications for rehearing or state court appeals 
we also record a regulatory asset when a mechanism is in place to recover current expenditures and historical experience indicates that recovery of incurred costs is probable  such as the regulatory assets for pension benefits  and deferred income tax 
if we determine that a portion of our assets used in utility operations is not recoverable in customer rates  we would be required to impair an asset and write down the assets valuation 
the hawaii water grc for the ka anapali district included a million asset impairment which was recorded during and the cal water grc settlement included a million asset impairment which was recorded during goodwill accounting and evaluation for impairment in november of and  we performed annual impairment tests of the remaining goodwill balance of million by comparing the fair value of hawaii water  the reporting unit  with its carrying amount  including goodwill and no impairment was recorded 
our analysis considered the approval of future rate case proceedings for the various operations of hawaii water based on historical rate of return filings allowed by the hawaii public utilities commission 
to the extent the approved rate of return filings 
table of contents allowed by the hawaii public utilities commission are less than expected  an impairment of the recorded goodwill may occur 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate in the period that includes the enactment date 
we must also assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance would be recorded 
if a valuation allowance were required  it could significantly increase income tax expense 
in management view  a valuation allowance was not required at december  or december  we anticipate that future rate actions by the regulatory commissions will reflect revenue requirements for the tax effects of temporary differences recognized  which have previously been passed through to customers 
the regulatory commissions have granted us rate increases to reflect the normalization of the tax benefits of the federal accelerated methods and available investment tax credits itcs for all assets placed in service after itcs are deferred and amortized over the lives of the related properties for book purposes 
during  the company filed an application for a change in accounting method section adjustment with the internal revenue service irs to implement the new repairs and maintenance deduction 
the new deduction is for qualified tangible property placed into service during and prior years 
the new tax regulations allow the company to deduct a significant amount of costs previously capitalized for book and tax purposes 
the company completed its analysis of the federal repairs maintenance deduction related to and prior years in the third quarter of the company federal repairs and maintenance deductions for qualified tangible property placed into service during and prior years was million and created a million deferred tax liability for the temporary timing difference between book and tax treatments as of september  the and prior years federal repairs and maintenance deduction eliminated the company and previously filed federal qualified us production activities deductions qpad and was recorded as a million federal income tax expense in the quarter ended september  the company state repairs deduction for qualified tangible property deductions placed into service during and prior years was million and was recorded as a million reduction to state income tax expense in the quarter ended september  the federal and state income tax repairs and maintenance deduction was estimated at million 
the estimated deduction increased the company federal deferred tax liability million and reduced state income tax expenses million in the quarter ended december  the federal income tax qpad deduction was eliminated by the repairs and maintenance deduction 
the repairs and maintenance deductions resulted in a federal net operating loss nol of million and a state nol of million 
the nol carry forward amounts are more likely than not to be recovered and therefore require no valuation allowance 
the nol carry forward does not begin to expire until during  the company filed an application for a change in accounting method section adjustment with the state of california to change its plant in service state tax depreciation method from the double declining method to the straight line method at the respective assets mid life 
the company application was approved by the state of california during the first quarter of california uses the flow through method of accounting for income tax depreciation 
as a result  the company reduced its income tax obligation by million  net of federal income taxes in the quarter ended march  
table of contents the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of will provide the company with additional federal income tax deductions for assets placed in service after september  and before december  the federal income tax deduction was million in  million in  and is estimated at million in the estimate will be finalized when we file the tax returns in the third quarter of the irs is presently auditing the company and federal income tax returns 
it is uncertain when the irs will complete its audit 
the company believes that the final resolution of the irs audit will not have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
during  the california franchise tax board completed an audit of the company and state income tax returns without any adjustments 
the company is not under audit by any other jurisdiction 
pension benefits we incur costs associated with our pension and postretirement health care benefits plans 
to measure the expense of these benefits  our management must estimate compensation increases  mortality rates  future health cost increases and discount rates used to value related liabilities and to determine appropriate funding 
different estimates used by our management could result in significant variances in the cost recognized for pension benefit plans 
the estimates used are based on historical experience  current facts  future expectations  and recommendations from independent advisors and actuaries 
we use an investment advisor to provide advice in managing the plan investments 
with the grc settlement  we anticipate any increases in funding for the pension benefits plans will be recovered in future rate filings  thereby mitigating the financial impact 
we believe it is probable that future costs will be recovered in future rates and therefore have recorded a regulatory asset in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
workers compensation and other claims we are self insured for a portion of workers compensation and other claims 
excess amounts are covered by insurance policies 
for workers compensation  we work with an independent actuary firm to estimate the discounted liability associated with claims submitted and claims not yet submitted based on historical data 
these estimates could vary significantly from actual claims paid  which could impact earnings and cash flows 
for other claims  management estimates the cost incurred but not yet paid using historical information 
actual costs could vary from these estimates 
management believes actual costs incurred would be allowed in future rates  mitigating the financial impact 
results of operations earnings net income was and million in and  respectively 
diluted earnings per common share were in and in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the diluted earnings per common share calculation was  in and  in net income increase million in  or per diluted common share  mostly due to a one time income tax benefit of million related to and prior years for state income tax repairs and maintenance deductions that we recognized in  an unrealized pre tax gain of million on our benefit plan insurance investments  a one time benefit of deferred wram revenues of million and associated costs of million that we recognized in  a decrease in the current year income tax provision due to the repairs and maintenance deductions which included million of prior years deductions which were recognized in  and lower financing costs for short term borrowings  which was partially offset by a million reduction to operating revenues due to the cost of capital adjustment mechanism and cost increases for employee wages and benefits  water production costs  and depreciation on plant placed into service during

also  million of deferred wram revenue was recognized as revenue in deferred wram revenue was million 
deferred wram revenue balances are expected to be collected from ratepayers beyond months following the end of the accounting period in which these revenues were recorded 
the increase was mostly due to an increase in customer usage 
the decreases in and were mostly due to decreases in customer usage 
the usage by existing customers can materially change based upon current weather patterns  influenced both by temperature and rainfall 
however  with the adoption of the wram and mcba for california customers on july   the impact of weather on gross margin has been minimized 
in  rate relief increased revenues by million with a significant portion due to increased rates from cal water grc and purchased water offsets

in   and purchased power expense increased million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively  primarily due to power supplier rate increases 
changes in climate change regulations could increase the cost of purchased power which in turn would result in an increase in the rates our power suppliers charge us 
any change in pricing of our purchased power in california would be recovered from our rate payers by the mcba 
any change in power costs in other states would be requested to be recovered by the rate payers in those states 
the impact of such legislation  is dependent upon the enacted date  the factors that impact our suppliers cost structure  and their ability to pass the costs to us in their approved tariffs

our capital expenditures in california will be impacted by certain california environmental legislation passed in prior years 
the ceqa permitting process involved in certain capital projects has increased the administrative cost of certain projects 
california emission controls are expected to increase the cost of vehicle acquisitions 
certain existing vehicles will also have to be retrofitted to comply with the current legislation

the effective tax rate is impacted by the allowable federal income tax benefit from an additional tax deduction for the qualified production activity deduction qpad for income attributed to the production of water 
the tax rate is also affected by the flow through method of accounting for income taxes which resulted from differences between tax depreciation and book depreciation on both pre assets  as well as all california assets 
the flow through method of accounting is described in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate the reversal of federal tax depreciation on pre assets to continue in future years  however  its effect on our tax provision is uncertain due to the offsetting flow through of state tax depreciation  which continues to increase with capital additions and the impact of cost to remove of pre assets

water supply our source of supply varies among our operating districts 
certain districts obtain all of their supply from wells  some districts purchase all of their supply from wholesale suppliers  and other districts obtain supply from a combination of wells and wholesale suppliers 
a small portion of supply comes from surface sources and is processed through company owned water treatment plants 
to the best of management knowledge  we are meeting water quality  environmental  and other regulatory standards for all company owned systems 
california normal weather pattern yields little precipitation between mid spring and mid fall 
the washington water service areas receive precipitation in all seasons  with the heaviest amounts during the winter 
new mexico water rainfall is heaviest in the summer monsoon season 
hawaii water receives precipitation throughout the year  with the largest amounts in the winter months 
water usage in all service areas is highest during the warm and dry summers and declines in the cool winter months 
rain and snow during the winter months replenish underground water aquifers and fill reservoirs  providing the water 
table of contents supply for subsequent delivery to customers 
to date  snowpack water content and rainfall accumulation during the water year is of normal as of january  per the california department of water resources 
precipitation in latter half of was below average 
management believes that supply pumped from underground aquifers and purchased from wholesale suppliers will be adequate to meet customer demand during and beyond 
however  water rationing may be required in future periods  if declared by the state or local jurisdictions 
long term water supply plans are developed for each of our districts to help assure an adequate water supply under various operating and supply conditions 
some districts have unique challenges in meeting water quality standards  but management believes that supplies will meet current standards using current treatment processes 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations during  we generated cash flow from operations of million  compared to million during  and million during in general  cash flow from operations is primarily generated by net income  non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  regulatory liabilities  other current liabilities  changes of prepaid income taxes  and the amortization periods allowed by the commission to recover mcba and other incurred costs 
cash generated by operations varies during the year 
the increase during compared to was primarily due to higher billing rates due to the grc  a reduction of million in federal and state income tax payments mostly due to the repairs and maintenance deductions  a million reduction of the december  undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances due to a reduction in the amortization periods and customer usage  the timing of employee pensions and other benefit payments  and the timing of liability payments 
the increase during compared to was primarily due to higher billing rates due to the grc  decreased prepaid income taxes as a result of tax refunds  the timing of employee pension and other benefit payments  the timing of liability payments  an increase in deferred income tax liabilities from additional bonus depreciation which was partially offset by growth in the undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances 
the water business is seasonal 
billed revenue is lower in the cool  wet winter months when less water is used compared to the warm  dry summer months when water use is highest 
this seasonality results in the possible need for short term borrowings under the bank lines of credit in the event cash is not sufficient to cover operating and capital costs during the winter period 
the increase in cash flow during the summer allows short term borrowings to be paid down 
customer water usage can be lower than normal in years when more than normal precipitation falls in our service areas or temperatures are lower than normal  especially in the summer months 
the reduction in water usage reduces cash flow from operations and increases the need for short term bank borrowings 
in addition  short term borrowings are used to finance capital expenditures until long term financing is arranged 
investing activities during and  we used million and million  respectively  of cash for capital expenditures  both company funded and developer funded 
the budget estimated capital expenditures between million and million 
annual expenditures fluctuate each year due to the availability of construction resources and our ability to obtain construction permits in a timely manner 
financing activities during and  there were no significant long term debt or equity offerings  however  on june   the company and cal water entered into new syndicated credit agreements  which provide for unsecured revolving credit facilities of up to an initial aggregate amount of million 
the syndicated credit facilities amend  expand  and replace the company and its subsidiaries existing credit 
table of contents facilities originally entered into on october  the new credit facilities extended the terms until june   increased the company and cal water unsecured revolving lines of credit  and lowered interest rates and fees 
the company and subsidiaries which it designates may borrow up to million under the company revolving credit facility 
cal water may borrow up to million under its revolving credit facility  however  all borrowings need to be repaid within twelve months unless otherwise authorized by the cpuc 
the proceeds from the revolving credit facilities may be used for working capital purposes  including the short term financing of capital projects 
the base loan rate may vary from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points  depending on the company total capitalization ratio 
likewise  the unused commitment fee may vary from basis points to basis points based on the same ratio 
the undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
on april   the cpuc issued a decision to shorten the amortization periods for cal water undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances for calendar years   and the decrease of million to the undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances during was due to an increase in collections and customer usage in the undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances were primarily financed by cal water with short term and long term financing arrangements to meet operational cash requirements 
interest on the undercollected net wram and mcba receivable balances  the interest recoverable from ratepayers  is limited to the current day commercial paper rates which is significantly lower than cal water short and long term financing rates 
the company borrowed million on our bank lines of credit  repaid million of short term borrowings  and added million of advances and contributions in aid of construction  which was reduced by refunds to developers of million 
on october   cal water entered into a capital lease arrangement with the city of hawthorne to operate the city water system for a year period 
the capital lease increased debt million during bond principal and other long term debt payments were million during  compared to million during the increase in compared to was the million repayment of series ggg and hhh during we raised the dividend rate in january to a post split annual rate of from the rate of 
the annual dividend rate has increased from per share of common stock in to per share of common stock in during the month of november  cal water issued million aggregate principal amount of its first mortgage bonds due in  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
short term financing short term liquidity is provided by the bank lines of credit described above and by internally generated funds 
long term financing is accomplished through the use of both debt and equity 
as of december   there were short term borrowings of million outstanding on our unsecured revolving line of credit  which was amended and replaced on june   compared to million outstanding on our original unsecured revolving line of credit as of december  the increase during was mostly to finance cal water  hawaii water  and washington water capital projects and operating activities during given our ability to access our lines of credit on a daily basis  cash balances are managed to levels required for daily cash needs and excess cash is invested in short term or cash equivalent instruments 
minimal operating levels of cash are maintained for washington water  new mexico water  and hawaii water 

table of contents california water service group and subsidiaries which it designates may borrow up to million under its new short term credit facility 
california water service company may borrow up to million under its new credit facility  however  all borrowings need to be repaid within twelve months unless otherwise authorized by the cpuc 
both short term credit agreements contain affirmative and negative covenants and events of default customary for credit facilities of this type including  among other things  limitations and prohibitions relating to additional indebtedness  liens  mergers  and asset sales 
also  these unsecured credit agreements contain financial covenants governing the company and its subsidiaries consolidated total capitalization ratio not to exceed and interest coverage ratio of three or more 
as of december   the company total capitalization ratio was trade payable is included as debt for this calculation and interest ratio was four and three fourths 
in summary  we have met all of the covenant requirements and are eligible to use the full amounts of these credit agreements 
there was million of new debt added to long term debt during  and we made principal payments on cal water first mortgage bonds and other long term debt of million during long term financing  which includes first mortgage bonds  senior notes  other debt securities  and common stock  has typically been used to replace short term borrowings and fund capital expenditures 
internally generated funds  after making dividend payments  provide positive cash flow  but have not been at a level to meet the needs of our capital expenditure requirements 
management expects this trend to continue given our capital expenditures plan for the next five years 
some capital expenditures are funded by payments received from developers for contributions in aid of construction or advances for construction 
funds received for contributions in aid of construction are non refundable  whereas funds classified as advances in construction are refundable 
management believes long term financing is available to meet our cash flow needs through issuances in both debt and equity instruments 
long term financing on january   cal water filed an application for additional financing authority with the cpuc 
this request was approved on september   and the cpuc decision authorizes cal water to issue million of debt and common stock to finance capital projects and operations 
in november  cal water issued million of first mortgage bonds in accordance with the cpuc decision 
in  we utilized cash generated from operations  borrowings on the lines of credit  and the first mortgage bond offerings 
we did not issue any significant common stock in in future periods  management anticipates funding our capital needs through a relatively balanced approach between long term debt and equity 
additional information regarding the bank borrowings and long term debt is presented in notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet transactions we do not utilize off balance sheet financing or utilize special purpose entity arrangements for financing 
we do not have equity ownership through joint ventures or partnership arrangements 
contractual obligations the contractual obligations presented in the table below represent our estimates of future payments under fixed contractual obligations and commitments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions and changes in interest rates  as well as action by third parties and other factors  may cause 
table of contents these estimates to change 
therefore  our actual payments in future periods may vary from those presented in the table below 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt interest payments advances for construction pension and post retirement benefits capital lease obligations facility leases system leases water supply contracts total excludes capital lease obligations as reported below 
pension and post retirement benefits includes million of short term pension obligations 
capital lease obligations represent total cash payments to be made in the future and includes interest expense of million 
our contractual obligations are summarized in the table above 
for pension and post retirement benefits other than pension obligations see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
long term debt payments include annual sinking fund payments on first mortgage bonds  maturities of long term debt  and annual payments on other long term obligations 
advances for construction represent annual contract refunds to developers for the cost of water systems paid for by the developers 
the contracts are non interest bearing  and refunds are generally on a straight line basis over a year period 
system and office leases include obligations associated with leasing water systems and rents for office space 
there are three capital leases  the most significant was the city of hawthorne water system 
in  we entered into a year capital lease agreement to operate the city of hawthorne water system 
the system  which is located near the hermosa redondo district  serves about half of hawthorne population 
the lease agreement required us to make an up front million lease payment to the city that is being amortized over the lease term 
additionally  annual lease payments of million are made to the city and shall be increased or decreased each year on july  by the same percentage that the rates charged to customers served by the water system increased or decreased  exclusive of pass through increases or decreases in the cost of water  power  and city imposed fees  compared to the rates in effect on july of the prior year  provided  that in no event will the annual lease payment be less than million 
under the lease  we are responsible for all aspects of system operation and capital improvements  although title to the system and system improvements reside with the city 
in exchange  we receive all revenue from the water system  which was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
at the end of the lease  the city is required to reimburse us for the unamortized value of capital improvements made during the term of the lease 
cal water has water supply contracts with wholesale suppliers in of its operating districts and for the two leased systems in hawthorne and commerce 
for each contract  the cost of water is established by the wholesale supplier and is generally beyond our control 
the amount paid annually to the wholesale suppliers is charged to purchased water expense on our statement of income 
most contracts do not require minimum annual payments and vary with the volume of water purchased 

table of contents we have a contract with the santa clara valley water district  which contains minimum purchase obligations 
the contract payment varies with the volume of water purchased above the minimum purchase levels 
management plans to continue to purchase and use at least the minimum quantity of water that is required to purchase under this contract in the future 
total paid to santa clara valley water district was million in  million in  and million in the water supply contract with stockton east water district sewd expires on april   requires a fixed  annual payment and does not vary during the year with the quantity of water delivered by the district 
due to the fixed price arrangement  we utilize as much water as possible from sewd in order to minimize the cost of operating company owned wells used to supplement sewd deliveries 
the total paid under the contract was million in  million in  million in pricing under the contract varies annually 
estimated annual contractual obligations in the above table are based on the same payment level as future cost increases by sewd are expected to be offset by a decline in the allocation of costs to us as more of these costs are expected to be allocated to other sewd customers due to growth within their service areas 
on september   we entered into an agreement with kern county water agency agency to obtain treated water for our operations 
the term of the agreement is to january   or until the agency bonds are repaid 
the agency bonds are described below 
under the terms of the agreement  we were obligated to purchase approximately  acre feet of treated water in and an incrementally higher volume of water for each subsequent year until  when we are obligated to purchase  acre feet of treated water per year 
we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and a treated water charge regardless of whether we can use the water in our operation  and we are obligated for these charges even if the agency cannot produce an adequate amount to supply the  acre feet in the year 
this agreement supersedes a prior agreement with kern county water agency for the supply of  acre feet of water per year 
total expense  under the prior agreement  was million in  million in  and million in three other parties  including the city of bakersfield  are also obligated to purchase a total of  acre feet per year under separate agreements with the agency 
further  the agency has the right to proportionally reduce the water supply provided to all of the participants if it cannot produce adequate supplies 
the participation of all parties in the transaction for expansion of the agency facilities  including its water purification plant  purchase of the water  and payment of interest and principal on the bonds being issued by the agency to finance the transaction  is required as a condition to the obligation of the agency to proceed with expansion of the agency facilities 
if any of the other parties does not use its allocation in a given year  that party is still obligated to pay its contracted amount 
the agency has issued bonds to fund the project and will use the payments of the capital facilities charges by us and the other contracted parties to meet the agency obligations to pay interest and repay principal on the bonds 
if any of the parties were to default on making payments of the capital facilities charge  then the other parties are obligated to pay for the defaulting party share on a pro rata basis 
if there is a payment default by a party and the remaining parties have to make payments  they are also entitled to a pro rata share of the defaulting party water allocation 
we expect to use all of its entitled water in our operations every year 
if additional treated water is available  all parties have an option to purchase this additional treated water  subject to the agency right to allocate the water among the parties 
if we were to pay for and receive additional amounts of water due to a default of another participating party  we believe we could use this additional water in our operations without incurring substantial increases in incremental costs 
the total obligation of all parties  excluding us  is approximately million to the agency 
based on the credit worthiness of the other participants  which are government entities  our management believes it to be highly unlikely that we would be required to assume any other parties obligations under the 
table of contents contract due to their default 
if a party defaults  we would receive entitlement to the additional water for assuming the additional obligation 
once the project is complete  we are obligated to pay a capital facilities charge and charges related to treated water that together total million annually  which equates to dollars per acre foot 
annual payments of million for the capital facilities charge began when the agency issued bonds to fund the project 
total treated water charge for was million 
once the entire expansion project is completed  the full annual payments will be million which will continue through the term of the agreement 
as treated water is being delivered  we will also be obligated for our portion of the operating costs  that portion is currently estimated to be dollars per acre foot 
the actual amount will vary due to variations from estimates  inflation  and other changes in the cost structure 
our overall estimated cost of dollars per acre foot is less than the estimated cost of procuring untreated water assuming water rights could be obtained and then providing treatment 
capital requirements capital requirements consist primarily of new construction expenditures for expanding and replacing utility plant facilities and the acquisition of water systems 
they also include refunds of advances for construction 
company funded and developer funded utility plant expenditures were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a majority of capital expenditures was associated with mains and water treatment equipment 
for  the company is estimating its capital expenditures to be between and million 
we do not expect significant increases or declines in annual capital expenditure for the next five years 
management expects developer funded expenditures in these expenditures will be financed by developers through refundable advances for construction and non refundable contributions in aid of construction 
developers are required to deposit the cost of a water construction project with us prior to our commencing construction work  or the developers may construct the facilities themselves and deed the completed facilities to us 
funds are generally received in advance of incurring costs for these projects 
advances are normally refunded over a year period without interest 
future payments for advances received are listed under contractual obligations above 
because non company funded construction activity is solely at the discretion of developers  we cannot predict the level of future activity 
the cash flow impact is expected to be minor due to the structure of the arrangements 
capital structure common stockholders equity was million at december  compared to million at december  as noted above  the company incurred additional long term debt in and total capitalization  including the current portion of long term debt  at december   was million and million at december  in future periods  the company intends to issue common stock and long term debt to finance our operations 
the capitalization ratios will vary depending upon the method we choose to finance our operations 
at december  capitalization ratios were common equity long term debt the return from both regulated and non regulated operations on average common equity was in compared to in 
table of contents acquisitions in   and there were no significant acquisitions 
real estate program we own real estate 
from time to time  certain parcels are deemed no longer used or useful for water utility operations 
most surplus properties have a low cost basis 
we developed a program to realize the value of certain surplus properties through sale or lease of those properties 
the program will be ongoing for a period of several years 
property sales produced pretax gains of less than million in  and as sales are dependent on real estate market conditions  future sales  if any  may or may not be at prior year levels 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not participate in hedge arrangements  such as forward contracts  swap agreements  options  or other contractual agreements to mitigate the impact of market fluctuations on our assets  liabilities  production  or contractual commitments 
we operate only in the united states and  therefore  are not subject to foreign currency exchange rate risks 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk  although this risk is lessened because we operate in a regulated industry 
if interest rates were to increase  management believes customer rates would increase accordingly  subject to commission approval in future grc filings 
the majority of our debt is long term at a fixed rate 
interest rate risk does exist on short term borrowings within our credit facilities  as these interest rates are variable 
we also have interest rate risk on new financing  as higher interest cost may occur on new debt if interest rates increase 
over the next months  approximately million of the million of existing long term debt instruments will mature or require sinking fund payments 
applying a hypothetical percent increase in the rate of interest charged on those borrowings would not have a material effect on our earnings
