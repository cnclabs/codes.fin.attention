company overview we are a development stage company engaged in the acquisition  exploration  and  if warranted  development of gold and silver mineral properties in north america 
our mineral properties are located in nevada and washington 
our pan gold project is in the development stage 
the tonopah  spring valley  gold rock and golden eagle gold properties are exploratory stage projects with identified gold mineralization 
the thunder mountain and pinyon projects are earlier stage gold and silver exploration projects 
we are currently working towards transitioning from a development stage company to a gold production company with plans to advance the pan gold property located in white pine county  nevada through to production by the second half of pan gold project during  the company completed and initiated several development activities which are key to the further progress of the permitting and eventual development of the mine 
these activities include  continuation of the permitting process  engineering of various mine related infrastructure  and completion of  feet of reverse circulation drilling in holes and  feet of core drilling in holes 
the permitting process is on schedule and well positioned for construction to begin during and production in to date  the company has spent million relating to the development of the pan gold project and anticipate spending an additional million in on additional permitting activities  with further development costs possible  dependent on the status of our permits 
gold rock project during  the drilling program continued as the company completed  feet of reverse circulation drilling and  feet of core drilling 
permit approval has been received for an expanded drill plan that will allow both in fill and step out drilling in to date  the company has spent million relating to the exploration of the gold rock project and we anticipate spending an additional million for the exploration program 
spring valley project barrick has the exclusive right to earn a interest in the spring valley project by spending us  on the property over five years 
barrick may increase its interest by total by spending an additional us  in the year immediately after vesting at 
at the company s election  barrick may also earn an additional total by carrying the company to a production decision and arranging financing for the company s share of mine construction expenses with the carrying and financing costs plus interest to be recouped by barrick once production has been established 
barrick reported funding exploration in on the spring valley project to meet its minimum level of us  by drilling  feet in reverse circulation holes and  feet in core holes 
barrick has informed the company that it has a exploration budget of us million and a development budget of us million  which is in excess of the amount needed to maintain the edm agreement 
other exploration projects the company maintained its interests in the thunder mountain project and is evaluating the property to determine if additional targets may exist that have not been tested to date 
the company maintained its interests in the tonopah project and continued efforts to model the veins based upon the drilling results 
the company maintained its interests in the golden eagle project 
the company entered into an exploration  development and mine operating agreement during with aurion resources ltd to acquire claims in the pinyon property  which is located in white pine county  nevada

depreciation expense during the year ended december  was  compared to  during the comparable period of  an increase of  this was primarily due to a increase in depreciable assets from the comparable period of legal  audit and accounting fees totaled  for the year ended december   an increase of  or for the period 
the company incurred increased legal and auditing fees during due to the s share registration statement filing in october the company also utilized consultants on a more regular basis in within the accounting function to meet the demands of the financing arrangements entered into by the company and related sec filing requirements 
the company also implemented new accounting software during the year ended december   which has led to consulting fees related to the integration of the software throughout the company 
mineral exploration expenditures for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
included in mineral exploration expenditures are non cash stock based compensation of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the details of the exploration expenses in each year may be found in the schedule of mineral exploration  of the audited consolidated annual financial statements  but are summarized here fiscal year change tonopah project    spring valley project    pan gold project    thunder mountain project    gold rock project    golden eagle project    property investigations and abandoned properties  total    exploration levels are determined by the success of previous exploration programs on each project and in part by available cash to fund additional programs 
as discussed earlier  barrick has been funding the spring valley project since the beginning of and the expenses reported by the company are related to activities not funded by barrick 
beginning on january   we began to capitalize permitting  engineering and other development activities as part of our plans to advance the pan gold project to production 
for the twelve months ended december  we capitalized  as compared to nil for the comparable period in mineral property interests written off for the year ended december  were nil compared to  during the comparative prior year ended december   which were related to the burnt canyon project 
office and administration expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  during the comparable period of  an increase of  or 
this increase is primarily a result of additional overhead costs eg the increase in office facilities related to our increase in employees  as discussed further below 
salaries and benefits for the year ended december  were  inclusive of  of non cash stock based compensation  compared to  and  respectively  during the comparable period of  a decrease of  we use an option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
we use the black scholes model  which requires considerable judgment selecting the subjective assumptions that are critical to the results produced by the model  to calculate the estimated fair value 
we record the estimated fair value as an expense on a pro rata basis over the vesting period of the options 
the increase in the cash component of salaries and benefits is attributable to a employee increase within the company from as of december  to as of december  other income expenses for the year ended december  was an expense of  compared to an income of  during the comparable period of  a net change of  during the year ended december   we incurred costs in evaluating certain specific financing options that management had considered  recorded a foreign exchange gain of  and recorded a net loss on the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities of  which accounted for a net change of  from the prior period in in addition  during the year ended december  we recorded a gain of  on the sale of property and equipment related to seymork investments limited 
effective january   we changed the functional currency for our us operations to the united states dollar and retained the canadian dollar as our reporting currency 
the canadian operations retained the canadian dollar as our functional currency 
our financial statements are translated from our us functional currency  the united states dollar  to the reporting currency  the canadian dollar  using the current rate method 
assets and liabilities are translated using the current rate in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses are translated at the average rate for the period 
adjustments resulting from the translation  if any  are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the foreign exchange rate of us to cad as of december  was  the foreign exchange rate as of march  was  which would not have a material impact on our financial statements 
us gaap requires the value of share purchase warrants issued with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than the company s canadian dollar functional currency to be considered as a liability and this liability is stated at fair value for each reporting period with changes in the liability being recorded through earnings 
the share purchase warrants included in the public offering of units that closed in july  had an exercise price of us 
the company recorded a fair value of  to warrant liability on july   calculated using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions expected life of months  volatility of  no dividend yield  and a risk free interest rate of and an exchange rate of 
on december   the fair value of the warrant liability was adjusted to  calculated using the following assumptions expected life of months  volatility of  no dividend yield  a risk free interest rate of and an exchange rate of 
due to the mandatory and voluntary conversion features  we recorded a derivative liability to account for the conversion features of the series a preferred shares 
an independent third party valuation company was engaged by us to perform a valuation of the associated liability based upon the terms of the agreement 
the valuation report noted that the fair value of the embedded derivative liability as of the issuance of the shares on december  was  calculated using a volatility of  a credit spread of  common stock closing price of us  risk free rate of and an exchange rate of 
we recorded share issue costs associated with the series a preferred shares of   of which were allocated proportionately to the derivative liability 
pursuant to derivative accounting guidance under asc  the derivative liability is to be re measured at each reporting period with changes in the liability being recorded through earnings 
the valuation report noted that the fair value of the embedded derivative liability as of december  was  calculated using a volatility of  a credit spread of  common stock closing price of us  risk free rate of and an exchange rate of 
the expense of  has been reported in other income within the twelve months ended december  consolidated statement of operations 
income tax recovery for the year ended december  decreased by  or  from the same period of the decrease is primarily related to the change in the us dollar denominated future income tax liability recorded upon the acquisition of pan nevada  tonopah and spring valley projects 
as of december  we had a deferred tax asset of  which is not considered to be realizable and therefore management has assessed a valuation allowance of  results of operations for the year ended december  compared to december  the following table summarizes our results of operations for the fiscal years ended december  and december  fiscal year change expenses consulting    depreciation    interest and bank charges    investor relations    legal  audit and accounting    management fees    mineral exploration expenditures see schedule  mineral property interests written off   mineral property interests recovered   office and administration    salaries and benefits    transfer agent and filing fees    travel    operating loss    other income expense    income tax recovery    net loss    significant differences in costs between the years are as follows net loss for the years ended december  and  were  and  respectively

legal  audit and accounting fees totaled  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  the increase primarily related to an entity restructuring analysis for tax planning purposes and a full internal control re evaluation  implementation and testing as required under the sarbanes oxley act 
mineral exploration expenditures for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
included in mineral exploration expenditures are non cash stock based compensation of  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the details of the exploration expenses in each year may be found in the schedule of mineral exploration  of the audited consolidated annual financial statements  but are summarized here fiscal year change tonopah project    spring valley project    pan project    burnt canyon project    thunder mountain project    gold rock project    golden eagle project    property investigations and abandoned properties   total    mineral property interests written off for the year ended december  were  related to the burnt canyon project compared to  during comparative prior year ended december   which were related to the roberts gold project 
office and administration expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  during the comparable period of  an increase of  the increase was primarily a result of additional overhead costs related to our increase in employees  as discussed further below 
director s fees  salaries and benefits during the year ended december  were  inclusive of  of non cash stock based compensation  compared to  and  respectively  during the comparable period of  an increase of  we use an option pricing model to estimate the value of stock options granted to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
we use the black scholes model  which requires considerable judgment selecting the subjective assumptions that are critical to the results produced by the model  to calculate the estimated fair value 
we record the estimated fair value as an expense on a pro rata basis over the vesting period of the options 
income tax recovery for year ended december  increased  from the same period of the increase is primarily related to the change in the us dollar denominated future income tax liability that was recorded upon the acquisition of the pan nevada and the tonopah and spring valley projects 
as stated above  us gaap requires the value of share purchase warrants issued with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than the company s canadian dollar functional currency to be considered as a liability and this liability is stated at fair value for each reporting period 
the share purchase warrants included in the public offering of units that closed in november   had an exercise price of us 
at november   the fair value of the warrants and the resulting warrant liability was  and at december  the fair value of the warrants and the warrant liability was  with the difference of  recorded as a loss on warrant liability in midway subsequently accelerated the expiry date of these warrants and by march    of the us share purchase warrants had been exercised and  warrants expired unexercised 
as a result  the warrant liability was extinguished in the first quarter of financial condition and liquidity as of december   we had working capital of  consisting of current assets of  and current liabilities of  this represents an increase of  from the working capital balance of  as of december  and reflects the proceeds of the recently completed series a preferred share offering in december and common share offering in july our current assets consist primarily of cash  some of which is deposited in short term  interest bearing accounts 
consistent with our plans  we continued to consume working capital to fund our exploration activities and other operating expenses 
we have never received revenue from gold or other mineral sales 
any revenue generated from the sale of gold or silver will be used to pay for operating costs first and then to supplement our existing cash for construction  additional exploration and other working capital needs 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis which assumes that the company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business in the foreseeable future 
in addition to the cash balance held as of december   midway plans to undertake financing in to fund exploration activities and operations through the next twelve months 
the company s ability to continue on a going concern basis beyond the next twelve months depends on its ability to successfully raise additional financing for the substantial capital expenditures required to achieve planned principal operations 
while the company has been successful in the past in obtaining financing  there is no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that such financing will be on terms acceptable to the company 
we have historically primarily relied on equity financings to fund our operations 
from inception through december   we received  in cash  services  stock options  and other consideration through the issuance of our common shares 
as of december   we did not have any outstanding debt 
management will be reviewing cash expenditures on an ongoing basis  and may be seeking to obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that management will succeed in obtaining additional financing  now or in the future 
the current market conditions could make it difficult or impossible for management to raise necessary funds to meet the company capital requirements 
failure to raise additional financing on a timely basis could cause the company to suspend its operations and eventually to forfeit or sell its interest in its properties 
in the past  management has been successful at raising funds to continue work on its mining properties 
however  there is no certainty that management will be able to raise additional funding on reasonable terms if at all  in which case the property may be joint ventured  sold or abandoned 
our financial statements do not reflect adjustments that would be necessary if the going concern assumption were not appropriate 
in july  we closed a public offering and issued  units at us per unit  each unit comprising one common share and one half of one non transferable common share purchase warrant 
each whole warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share of the company at a price of us per share for a period of months following the closing of the public offering  subject to acceleration provisions 
the gross proceeds of the financing of us  were allocated first to the fair value of the warrants at us  with the residual amount of us  to common shares 
we incurred  in issue costs and paid  to the agent as commission for this public offering 
on december   the alberta  british columbia and ontario securities commissions issued a final receipt for our short form prospectus  which along with our s shelf registration statement under the securities act of  as amended  declared effective on november  jointly the prospectus  allows the company to offer and sell  from time to time up to us  of our common shares  without par value  with or without warrants to purchase common shares  or any combination thereof in one or more transactions under the prospectus 
in december  we issued  series a preferred shares at us per share for gross proceeds of  us  by way of a private placement 
we incurred  in share issuance costs  of which we proportionately allocated  to the embedded derivative liability  the remaining share issuance costs of  were proportionately allocated to redeemable preferred stock 
there is also an eight percent annual dividend  compounding monthly  payable quarterly at our option in cash or our common shares on the series a preferred shares 
as of march   there are  stock options outstanding at prices ranging from to and  share purchase warrants at 
while it is probable that some of these options and share purchase warrants will be exercised  it is not possible to predict the timing or the amount of funds which might be received 
net cash used in operating activities was  during the year ended december   compared to  during  a decrease of  the decrease of cash used in operating activities in is primarily attributable to a decrease in the mineral exploration expenditures of  due to the pan gold project becoming a development stage project and the majority of the costs incurred being capitalized to mine development as of january  in addition  salaries and benefits decreased by  primarily due to a  reduction in stock based compensation recorded within salaries and benefits from the comparable period in  offset by an increase in the cash component of salaries and benefits attributable to a employee increase from as of december  to as of december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  as noted above  the pan gold project is a developmental stage project and the majority of costs incurred were capitalized to mine development as of january   the increase of  from the year ended december  is almost entirely attributable to the  of costs capitalized to the pan gold project during further  although most of our exploration stage expenditures are recorded as an expense rather than an investment  we capitalize the acquisition cost of land and mineral rights and certain equipment that has alternative future uses or significant salvage value  including rolling stock  furniture  and electronics  and the cost of these capitalized assets is reflected in our investing activities 
during  we invested in a residential building  residential land parcels and vehicles 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  consisting of net proceeds from the sales of our common shares and the closing of our series a preferred shares offering in december during  all of the cash from financing activities related to the sale of our common shares 
the balance of cash and equivalents increased to  as of december  from  as of december   a net increase in cash of  off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations we have obligations under operating leases for our corporate offices in englewood  colorado and in ely  nevada and office equipment until future minimum lease payments for non cancellable leases with initial lease terms in excess of one year are included 
in addition  we have cancellable purchase obligations related to consulting service agreements until fiscal year current year one three years three five years thereafter total operating lease obligations    purchase obligations   total     inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
environmental compliance our current and future exploration and development activities  as well as our future mining and processing operations  are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations in the countries in which we conduct our activities 
these laws and regulations govern the protection of the environment  prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health  mine safety  toxic substances and other matters 
we expect to be able to comply with those laws and do not believe that compliance will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
we intend to obtain all licenses and permits required by all applicable regulatory agencies in connection with our mining operations and exploration activities 
we intend to maintain standards of environmental compliance consistent with regulatory requirements 
midway has an obligation to reclaim its properties after the surface has been disturbed by exploration methods at the site 
as of december   we have accrued  us  related to reclamation and other closure requirements at our properties  compared to  us  at december  these liabilities are covered by a combination of surety bonds and restricted cash totaling  us  at december   us 
we have accrued as a current liability what management believes is the present value of our best estimate of the liabilities as of december   however  it is possible that our obligations may change in the near or long term depending on a number of factors 
critical accounting policies we believe that application of the following accounting policies  which are critical to our financial position and results of operations  requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates that are critical to the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the identification and valuation of proven and probable reserves  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  estimates related to asset impairments of long lived assets and investments  classification of expenditures as either an asset or an expense  valuation of deferred tax assets  and the likelihood of loss contingencies management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
estimates and assumptions are revised periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period it is determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
proven and probable reserves the definition of proven and probable reserves is set forth in sec industry guide proven reserves are reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves are reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
in addition  reserves cannot be considered proven and probable until they are supported by a feasibility study  indicating that the reserves have had the requisite geologic  technical and economic work performed and are economically and legally extractable at the time of the reserve determination 
mineral acquisition costs the costs of acquiring land and mineral rights are considered tangible assets 
significant acquisition payments are capitalized 
general  administrative and holding costs to maintain an exploration property are expensed as incurred 
if a mineable ore body is discovered  such costs are amortized when production begins using the units of production method 
if no mineable ore body is discovered or such rights are otherwise determined to have diminished value  such costs are expensed in the period in which the determination is made 
exploration costs exploration costs are charged to expense as incurred 
costs to identify new mineral resources  to evaluate potential resources  and to convert mineral resources into proven and probable reserves are considered exploration costs 
design  construction  and development costs certain costs to design and construct mine and processing facilities may be incurred prior to establishing proven and probable reserves 
under these circumstances  we classify such projects as an exploration stage project and expense substantially all costs  including design  engineering  construction  and installation of equipment 
certain types of equipment  which have alternative uses or significant salvage value  may be capitalized 
if a project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  costs incurred in anticipation of production can be capitalized 
such costs include development drilling to further delineate the ore body  removing overburden during the pre production phase  building access ways  constructing facilities  and installing equipment 
interest costs  if any  incurred during the development phase  would be capitalized until the assets are ready for their intended use 
the cost of start up activities and on going costs to maintain production are expensed as incurred 
costs of abandoned projects are charged to operations upon abandonment 
if a project commences commercial production and the project is determined to contain proven and probable reserves  amortization and depletion of capitalized costs is computed on a unit of production basis over the expected reserves of the project based on estimated recoverable gold equivalent ounces 
depreciation of related capitalized equipment is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
if impairment indicators exist  we perform additional analysis to quantify the amount by which capitalized costs exceed recoverable value 
the periodic evaluation of capitalized costs is based upon expected future cash flows  including estimated salvage values 
as of december   some of our mineral resources do not meet the definition of proven or probable reserves or value beyond proven and probable reserves and any potential revenue has been excluded from the cash flow assumptions 
accordingly  for these properties  recoverability of capitalized cost is based primarily on estimated salvage values  or alternative future uses 
property and equipment all items of property and equipment are carried at cost not in excess of their estimated net realizable value 
normal maintenance and repairs are charged to earnings while expenditures for major maintenance and betterments are capitalized 
gains or losses on disposition are recognized in operations 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for the fair value of stock options that are granted 
expense is recognized on a pro rata basis over the vesting periods  if any  of the options 
the fair value of stock options at their grant date is estimated by using the black scholes option pricing model 
income taxes income taxes are computed using the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting purposes and the effect of net operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets are evaluated to determine if it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
valuation allowances have been established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets in recognition of significant uncertainties regarding their ultimate realization 
further  the evaluation has determined that there are no uncertain tax positions required to be disclosed 
fair value determining the fair value of assets and liabilities involves the use of judgment  as some assets and liabilities do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities  and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
recent accounting pronouncements we evaluate the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations  primarily the financial accounting standards board fasb  the sec  and the emerging issues task force eitf  to determine the impact of new pronouncements on us gaap and the impact on the company 
recently adopted accounting standards in may  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updated the guidance in asc topic  fair value measurement 
the amendments in this update generally represent clarifications of topic  but also include some instances where a particular principle or requirement for measuring fair value or disclosing information about fair value measurements has changed 
this update results in common principles and requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements in accordance with us gaap and ifrs 
the amendments in this update are to be applied prospectively 
this guidance became effective for the company as of january  the adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updated the guidance in asc topic  comprehensive income 
under the amendments in this update  an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
in both choices  an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income  each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income  and a total amount for comprehensive income 
this update eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the amendments in this update do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income 
this guidance became effective for the company as of january  in december of  the fasb issued asu no 
 which defers only those provisions within asu pertaining to reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
this guidance  except for those provisions deferred by asu  became effective for the company as of the beginning january  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations

 and corrections related to fasb accounting standards update sec update in accounting standards update no 
this update amends various sec paragraphs pursuant to the issuance of sab no 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards updates in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  technical corrections and improvements in accounting standards update no 
the amendments in this update cover a wide range of topics in the accounting standards codification 
these amendments include technical corrections and improvements to the accounting standards codification and conforming amendments related to fair value measurements 
the amendments in this update will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  the adoption of asu is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are engaged in the acquisition  exploration  and  if warranted  development of gold and silver mineral properties in north america 
the value of our properties is related to the price of gold  and changes in the price of gold could affect our ability to generate revenue from our portfolio of gold and silver projects 
gold prices may fluctuate widely from time to time and are affected by numerous factors  including the following expectations with respect to the rate of inflation  exchange rates  interest rates  global and regional political and economic circumstances and governmental policies  including those with respect to gold holdings by central banks 
the demand for and supply of gold affect gold prices  but not necessarily in the same manner as demand and supply affect the prices of other commodities 
the supply of gold consists of a combination of new mine production and existing stocks of bullion and fabricated gold held by governments  public and private financial institutions  industrial organizations and private individuals 
the demand for gold primarily consists of jewelry and investments 
additionally  hedging activities by producers  consumers  financial institutions and individuals can affect gold supply and demand 
while gold can be readily sold on numerous markets throughout the world  its market value cannot be predicted for any particular time
