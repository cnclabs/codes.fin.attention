canadian reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by national instrument ni 
the definitions in ni are adopted from those given by the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum 
us reporting requirements for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the united states securities and exchange commission sec industry guide these reporting standards have similar goals in terms of conveying an appropriate level of confidence in the disclosures being reported  but embody differing approaches and definitions 
we estimate and report our mineral resources and mineral reserves according to the definitions set forth in ni and modify them as appropriate to conform to sec industry guide for reporting in the us the definitions for each reporting standard are presented below with supplementary explanation and descriptions of the similarities and differences 
ni definitions mineral reserve the term mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured or indicated mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
the study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction can be justified 
a mineral reserve includes diluting materials and allowances for losses that may occur when the material is mined 
proven mineral reserve the term proven mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
probable mineral reserve the term probable mineral reserve refers to the economically mineable part of an indicated  and in some circumstances  a measured mineral resource demonstrated by at least a preliminary feasibility study 
this study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified 
mineral resource the term mineral resource refers to a concentration or occurrence of diamonds  natural solid inorganic material  or natural solid fossilized organic material including base and precious metals  coal  and industrial minerals in or on the earth crust in such form and quantity and of such a grade or quality that it has reasonable prospects for economic extraction 
the location  quantity  grade  geological characteristics and continuity of a mineral resource are known  estimated or interpreted from specific geological evidence and knowledge 
measured mineral resource the term measured mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support production planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration  sampling and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough to confirm both geological and grade continuity 
indicated mineral resource the term indicated mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity  grade or quality  densities  shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters  to support mine planning and evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit 
the estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably assumed 
inferred mineral resource the term inferred mineral resource refers to that part of a mineral resource for which quantity and grade or quality can be estimated on the basis of geological evidence and limited sampling and reasonably assumed  but not verified  geological and grade continuity 
the estimate is based on limited information and sampling gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops  trenches  pits  workings and drill holes 
qualified person the term qualified person refers to an individual who is an engineer or geoscientist with at least five years of experience in mineral exploration  mine development or operation or mineral project assessment  or any combination of these  has experience relevant to the subject matter of the mineral project and the technical report and is a member in good standing of a professional association 
sec industry guide definitions reserve the term reserve refers to that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
reserves must be supported by a feasibility study done to bankable standards that demonstrates the economic extraction 
bankable standards implies that the confidence attached to the costs and achievements developed in the study is sufficient for the project to be eligible for external debt financing 
a reserve includes adjustments to the in situ tonnes and grade to include diluting materials and allowances for losses that might occur when the material is mined 
proven reserve the term proven reserve refers to reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserve the term probable reserve refers to reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
mineralized material the term mineralized material refers to material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
non reserves the term non reserves refers to mineralized material that is not included in the reserve as it does not meet all of the criteria for adequate demonstration for economic or legal extraction 
exploration stage an exploration stage prospect is one which is not in either the development or production stage 
development stage a development stage project is one which is undergoing preparation of an established commercially mineable deposit for its extraction but which is not yet in production 
this stage occurs after completion of a feasibility study 
production stage a production stage project is actively engaged in the process of extraction and beneficiation of mineral reserves to produce a marketable metal or mineral product 
industry guide does not require designation of a qualified person 
for industry guide purposes the feasibility study must include adequate information on mining  processing  metallurgical  economic  and other relevant factors that demonstrate  at the time of reporting  that economic extraction is justified

gsbpl operates a gold ore processing facility at bogoso prestea with a nominal capacity of up to million tonnes of ore per annum  which uses bio oxidation technology to treat refractory ores bogoso refractory plant 
in addition  gsbpl has a carbon in leach cil processing facility located adjacent to the refractory plant  which is suitable for treating oxide and other non refractory gold ores bogoso non refractory plant at a nominal rate up to million tonnes per annum 
bogoso prestea produced and sold  ounces of gold in  and  and  ounces of gold in and  respectively 
through another owned subsidiary  golden star wassa limited gswl  we own and operate the wassa open pit gold mine and carbon in leach processing plant wassa  located approximately km east of bogoso prestea 
the design capacity of the carbon in leach processing plant at wassa wassa processing plant is nominally million tonnes per annum but varies depending on the ratio of hard to soft ore 
gswl also owns the hwini butre and benso concessions hbb in southwest ghana 
currently our primary hbb ore source is the father brown pit which is located on the hwini butre concession 
ore from the hbb mines is sent to wassa for processing 
the hwini butre and benso concessions are located approximately km and km  respectively  south of wassa along the company dedicated haul road 
mining activities were completed at benso during wassa hbb produced and sold  ounces of gold in and  and  ounces of gold in and  respectively 
through gsbpl  we own the prestea underground  which is located on the prestea property and consists of a currently inactive gold mine and associated support facilities 
gsbpl owns of the mine  and we are currently preparing a feasibility study to reopen the mine 
we also hold interests in several gold exploration projects in ghana and elsewhere in west africa  including niger and c te d ivoire  and in south america we hold and manage exploration properties in brazil 
all our operations  with the exception of certain exploration projects  transact business in us dollars and keep financial records in us dollars 
our accounting records are kept in accordance with us gaap 
our fiscal year ends december we are a reporting issuer or the equivalent in all provinces of canada  in ghana and in the united states and file disclosure documents with securities regulatory authorities in canada and ghana and with the united states securities and exchange commission 
gold sales and production we produced  ounces of gold in and  ounces in currently  all of our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery which arranges for the sale of our gold 
our gold is sold in the form of dor bars that average approximately gold by weight with the remaining portion being silver and other metals 
the sales price is based on the london pm fix on the day of shipment to the refinery 
gold price history the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors all of which are beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation  fluctuation in the relative values of the us dollar and foreign currencies  changes in global and regional gold demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world

business strategy and development our business and development strategy is focused primarily on the exploration  development and operation of gold properties in ghana 
we also pursue gold exploration activities in south america and other countries in west africa 
we acquired the bogoso property and began operating its mines and cil processing facility in in  we acquired the prestea property located adjacent to the bogoso property 
in early gsbpl acquired a interest in the prestea underground property  and since then its interest increased to as a result of subsequent exploration and maintenance expenditures incurred on the property 
in late  we acquired wassa and constructed the wassa processing plant  which began commercial operation in april in july  we completed construction and development of the bogoso refractory plant 
in late  we acquired the hbb properties consisting of the benso and hwini butre properties 
benso began sending ore to the wassa processing plant in  and in  following its development phase  hwini butre began sending ore to the wassa processing plant 
our current focus is to improve operating efficiencies at both operations  to complete a feasibility study for the prestea underground and to continue broader and deeper drilling at the wassa pits to evaluate the expansion potential for the wassa operation 
our longer term objective is to continue the growth of our mining business to become a mid tier gold producer 
we continue to evaluate potential acquisition and merger opportunities that could further increase our annual gold production 
however  we presently have no agreement or understanding with respect to any specific potential transaction 
in addition to our gold mining and development activities  we actively explore for gold in west africa and south america  investing approximately million on such activities during and approximately million in we are conducting regional reconnaissance projects in ghana  cote d ivoire and brazil  and have drilled more advanced targets in ghana and niger

mineral reserves our proven and probable mineral reserves are estimated in conformance with definitions set out in ni we have filed technical reports regarding the initial disclosure of mineral reserves and mineral resources for bogoso prestea and wassa hbb as required by ni the proven and probable mineral reserves are those ore tonnages contained within economically optimized pits  configured using current and predicted mining and processing methods and related operating costs and performance parameters 
we believe that our mineral reserves are estimated on a basis consistent with the definition of proven and probable reserves prescribed for use in the us by the us securities and exchange commission and set forth in sec industry guide see our glossary of terms 
in estimating mineral reserves  we first design an economically optimized pit based on all operating costs  including the costs to mine 
since all material lying within the optimized pit will be mined  the cut off grade used in determining our mineral reserves is estimated based on the material that  having been mined  is economic to transport and process without regard to primary mining costs ie mining costs that were appropriately applied at the economic optimization stage 
the qa qc controls program used in connection with the estimation of our mineral reserves consists of regular insertion and analysis of blanks and standards to monitor laboratory performance 
blanks are used to check for contamination 
standards are used to check for grade dependence biases

the stated mineral reserve for wassa includes hwini butre 
the stated mineral reserves have been prepared in accordance with ni standards of disclosure for mineral projects and are classified in accordance with the canadian institute of mining  metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards for mineral resources and mineral reserves 
mineral reserves are equivalent to proven and probable reserves as defined by the sec industry guide mineral reserve estimates reflect the company reasonable expectation that all necessary permits and approvals will be obtained and maintained 
mining dilution and mining recovery vary by deposit and have been applied in estimating the mineral reserves 
the and mineral reserves were prepared under the supervision of dr 
martin raffield  senior vice president of technical services for the company 
dr 
raffield is a qualified person as defined by ni the mineral reserves at december   were estimated using a gold price of  per ounce  which is approximately equal to the three year average gold price 
at december   mineral reserves were estimated using a gold price of  per ounce 
the terms non refractory and refractory refer to the metallurgical characteristics of the ore 
we plan to process the refractory ore in our sulfide bio oxidation plant at bogoso and to process the non refractory ore in the bogoso and wassa non refractory processing plants 
the slope angles of all pit designs are based on geotechnical criteria as established by external consultants 
the size and shape of the pit designs are guided by consideration of the results from a pit optimization program 
the parameters for the pit optimization program are based on a gold price of  per ounce and historical and projected operating costs at bogoso prestea  wassa  hwini butre and benso 
metallurgical recoveries are based on historical performance or estimated from test work and typically range from to for non refractory ores and from to for refractory ores

where such a variance occurs it will arise from the differing requirements for reporting mineral reserves 
for example  ni has a minimum requirement that mineral reserves be supported by a pre feasibility study  whereas sec industry guide requires support from a detailed feasibility study that demonstrates that economic extraction is justified 
for the mineral reserves at december   and  there is no difference between the mineral reserves as disclosed under ni and those disclosed under sec industry guide  and therefore no reconciliation is provided 
reconciliation of proven and probable mineral reserves december  to december  tonnes millions contained ounces millions tonnes of opening ounces of opening mineral reserves at december  gold price increase and exploration changes and mining depletion engineering mineral reserves at december  notes to the reconciliation of mineral reserves gold price increase represents changes resulting from an increase in gold price used in the mineral reserve estimates from  per ounce in to  per ounce in exploration changes include changes due to geological modeling  data interpretation and resource block modeling methodology as well as exploration discovery of new mineralization 
mining depletion represents the mineral reserve within the volume mined in with adjustments to account for stockpile addition and depletions during and therefore does not correspond with actual gold production 
engineering includes changes as a result of changes in operating costs  mining dilution and recovery assumptions  metallurgical recoveries  pit slope angles and other mine design and permitting considerations

non reserves measured and indicated mineral resources cautionary note to us investors concerning estimates of measured and indicated mineral resources this section uses the terms measured mineral resources and indicated mineral resources 
we advise us investors that while those terms are recognized and required by canadian regulations  the us securities and exchange commission does not recognize them 
us investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into mineral reserves 
our measured and indicated mineral resources  which are reported in this form k  do not include that part of our mineral resources that have been converted to proven and probable mineral reserves as shown above  and have been estimated in compliance with definitions set out in ni golden star resources has filed technical reports regarding the initial disclosure of mineral reserves and mineral resources for bogoso prestea  wassa and the hbb properties as required by ni regulations

we advise us investors that while this term is recognized and required by ni  the us securities and exchange commission does not recognize it 
inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence  and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility 
it cannot be assumed that all or any part of inferred mineral resources will ever be upgraded to a higher category 
in accordance with canadian rules  estimates of inferred mineral resources cannot form the basis of feasibility or other economic studies

customers currently all of our gold production is shipped to a south african gold refinery 
the refinery arranges for sale of the gold on the day it is shipped from the mine site and we receive payment for gold sold two working days after the gold leaves the mine site 
the global gold market is competitive with numerous banks and refineries willing to buy gold on short notice 
therefore  we believe that the loss of our current customer would not materially delay or disrupt revenues 
competition our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully and economically explore  acquire  develop and operate new and existing gold properties 
factors that allow gold producers to remain competitive in the market over the long term include the quality and size of ore bodies  cost of operation  and the acquisition and retention of qualified employees 
we compete with other mining companies in the acquisition  exploration  financing and development of new mineral properties 
there is significant competition for a limited number of gold acquisition and exploration opportunities 
we also compete with other mining companies for skilled mining engineers  mine and processing plant operators and mechanics  mining equipment  geologists  geophysicists and other experienced technical personnel 
seasonality all of our operations are in tropical climates that experience annual rainy seasons 
ore output from our surface mining operations can be reduced during wet periods 
our mine plans anticipate periods of high rain fall each year 
exploration activities are generally timed to avoid the rainy periods to ease transportation logistics associated with wet roads and swollen rivers

risk factors you should consider the following discussion of risks in addition to the other information contained in or included by reference in this form k 
in addition to historical information  the information in this form k contains forward looking statements about our future business and performance 
our actual operating results and financial performance may be very different from what we expect as of the date of this form k 
the risks below address material factors that may affect our future operating results and financial performance 
general risks a substantial or prolonged decline in gold prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
the price of our common shares  our financial results and our exploration  development and mining activities have previously been  and would in the future be significantly adversely affected by a substantial or prolonged decline in the price of gold 
the price of gold is volatile and is affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as the sale or purchase of gold by various central banks and financial institutions  inflation or deflation  fluctuation in the value of the united states dollar and foreign currencies  global and regional demand  and the political and economic conditions of major gold producing countries throughout the world 
any drop in the price of gold adversely impacts our revenues  profits and cash flows 
in particular  a sustained low gold price could cause suspension of our mining operations at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb if these operations become uneconomic at the then prevailing gold price  thus further reducing revenues  cause us to be unable to fulfill our obligations under agreements with our partners or under our permits and licenses which could cause us to lose our interests in  or be forced to sell  some of our properties  cause us to be unable to fulfill our debt payment obligations  halt or delay the development of new projects  and reduce funds available for exploration  with the result that depleted mineral reserves may not replaced by new exploration activities 
furthermore  the need to reassess the feasibility of any of our development projects because of declining gold prices could cause substantial delays or could interrupt development until a reassessment could be completed 
mineral reserve estimations and life of mine plans incorporating significantly lower gold prices could result in reduced estimates of mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources and in material write downs of our investment in mining properties and increased amortization  reclamation and closure charges 
we have incurred and may in the future incur substantial losses that could make financing our operations and business strategy more difficult and that may affect our ability to service our debts as they become due 
we had net losses of million in  million in and million in in recent years increasing operating costs  lower ore grades from our mines and lower gold recovery rates have been the primary factors contributing to such losses 
in the future  these factors  as well as declining gold prices  could cause us to continue to be unprofitable 
future operating losses could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital if needed  and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  continuing operating losses could affect our ability to meet our debt payment obligations 
our obligations could strain our financial position and impede our business strategy 
we had total consolidated debt and liabilities as of december   of million  including million in equipment financing loans  million million face value pursuant to the convertible debentures as defined herein  million of current trade payables and accrued liabilities  million of current and future taxes  and a million accrual for environmental rehabilitation liabilities 
our indebtedness and other liabilities may increase as a result of general corporate activities 
these liabilities could have important consequences  including the following increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  exploration costs and other general corporate requirements  requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  which would reduce our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures  exploration and development projects and other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and placing us at a disadvantage when compared to our competitors that have less debt relative to their market capitalization 
estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserve mineral resources could be inaccurate  which could cause actual production and costs to differ from estimates 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating proven and probable mineral reserves and non reserve measured  indicated and inferred mineral resources  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves is a function of the quantity and quality of available data and of the assumptions made and judgments used in engineering and geological interpretation  which could prove to be unreliable 
these estimates of mineral reserves and non reserves may not be accurate  and mineral reserves and non reserves may not be able to be mined or processed profitably 
fluctuation in gold prices  results of drilling  metallurgical testing  changes in operating costs  production  and the evaluation of mine plans subsequent to the date of any estimate could require revision of the estimates 
the volume and grade of mineral reserves mined and processed and recovery rates might not be the same as currently anticipated 
any material reductions in estimates of our mineral reserves and non reserves  or of our ability to extract these mineral reserves and non reserves  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently have only two sources of operational cash flows  which could be insufficient by themselves to fund our continuing exploration and development activities 
our only current significant internal sources of funds are operational cash flows from bogoso prestea and wassa hbb 
the anticipated continuing exploration and development of our properties are expected to require significant expenditures over the next several years 
during if cash on hand  free cash flows generated by bogoso prestea and wassa hbb and our equipment financing facility is insufficient to cover all of our capital investment needs  we may require additional financing or we may consider rescheduling capital spending 
our ability to raise significant new capital will be a function of macroeconomic conditions  future gold prices  our operational performance and our then current cash flow and debt position  among other factors 
continued uncertainty in the global economy may affect lending practices and our ability to access capital 
as a result  we may not be able to obtain adequate financing on acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to delay or indefinitely postpone further exploration and development of our properties 
consequently  we could lose our interest in  or could be forced to sell  some of our properties 
we are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates  which could materially adversely affect our financial position 
our revenues are in united states dollars  and we maintain most of our working capital in united states dollars or united states dollar denominated securities 
we convert our united states funds to foreign currencies as certain payment obligations become due 
accordingly  we are subject to fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states dollar and these foreign currencies  and these fluctuations could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
a significant portion of the operating costs at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb is based on the ghanaian currency  the cedi 
we are required by the government of ghana to convert into cedis of the foreign exchange proceeds that we receive from selling gold  but the government could require us to convert a higher percentage of gold sales proceeds into cedis in the future 
we obtain construction and other services and materials and supplies from providers in south africa and other countries 
the costs of goods and services could increase or decrease due to changes in the value of the united states dollar or the cedi  the euro  the south african rand or other currencies 
consequently  operation and development of our properties could be more costly than anticipated 
any hedging activities might be unsuccessful and incur losses 
while we held no hedging instruments during  we may enter into additional hedging arrangements in the future 
future hedging activities might not protect adequately against declines in the price of gold 
in addition  although a hedging program could protect us from a decline in the price of gold  it might also prevent us from benefiting fully from price increases 
for example  as part of a hedging program  we could be obligated to sell gold at a price lower than the then current market price 
risks inherent in acquisitions that we might undertake could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
we plan to continue to pursue the acquisition of producing  development and advanced stage exploration properties and companies 
the search for attractive acquisition opportunities and the completion of suitable transactions are time consuming and expensive  divert management attention from our existing business and may be unsuccessful 
success in our acquisition activities depends on our ability to complete acquisitions on acceptable terms and integrate the acquired operations successfully with our operations 
any acquisition would be accompanied by risks 
for example  there may be a significant change in commodity prices after we have committed to complete a transaction and established the purchase price or exchange ratio  a material ore body may prove to be below expectations or the acquired business or assets may have unknown liabilities which may be significant 
we may lose the services of our key employees or the key employees of any business we acquire or have difficulty integrating operations and personnel 
the integration of an acquired business or assets may disrupt our ongoing business and our relationships with employees  suppliers and contractors 
any one or more of these factors or other risks could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition of properties or companies  and could have a material adverse effect on our current business and financial condition and on our ability to grow 
we are subject to litigation risks 
all industries  including the mining industry  are subject to legal claims  with and without merit 
as such  we are involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to our business 
defense and settlement costs can be substantial  even with respect to claims that have no merit 
due to the inherent uncertainty of the litigation process  the resolution of any particular legal proceeding could have a material effect on our future financial position and results of operations 
we are subject to a number of operational hazards that can delay production or result in liability to us 
our activities are subject to a number of risks and hazards including power shortages  mechanical and electrical equipment failures  parts availability  unexpected changes in ore grades  unexpected changes in ore chemistry and gold recoverability  environmental hazards  discharge of pollutants or hazardous chemicals  industrial accidents  labor disputes and shortages  supply and shipping problems and delays  shortage of equipment and contractor availability  unusual or unexpected geological or operating conditions  cave ins of underground workings  failure of pit walls or dams  fire  marine and transit damage and or loss  changes in the regulatory environment  including in the area of climate change  delayed or restricted access to ore due to community interventions  and natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods  droughts and earthquakes 
these or other occurrences could result in damage to  or destruction of  mineral properties or production facilities  personal injury or death  environmental damage  delays in mining  delayed production  monetary losses and possible legal liability 
satisfying such liabilities could be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our mining operations are subject to numerous environmental laws  regulations and permitting requirements and bonding requirements that can delay production and adversely affect operating and development costs 
compliance with existing regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to environmental protection  in the jurisdictions where we have projects may have a material adverse effect on our exploration activities  results of operations and competitive position 
new or expanded regulations  if adopted  could affect the exploration  development  or operation of our projects or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our operations 
portions of our wassa property  as well as some of our exploration properties in ghana  including dunkwa  are located within forest reserve areas 
although dunkwa and wassa have been identified by the government of ghana as eligible for mining permits  subject to normal procedures and a site inspection  permits for projects in forest reserve areas may not be issued in a timely fashion  or at all  and such permits may contain special requirements with which it is burdensome or uneconomic to comply 
mining and processing gold from our future development projects in ghana will require mining  environmental  and other permits and approvals from the government of ghana 
the trend to longer lead times in obtaining environmental permits has reached a point where we are no longer able to accurately estimate permitting times for our planning purposes 
the increases in permitting requirements could affect our environmental management activities including  but not limited to  tailings disposal facilities and water management projects at our mines 
due to an increased level of non governmental organization activity targeting the mining industry in ghana  the potential for the government of ghana to delay the issuance of permits or impose new requirements or conditions upon mining operations in ghana may increase 
any changes in the government of ghana policies  or their application  may be costly to comply with and may delay mining operations 
the exact nature of other environmental control problems  if any  which we may encounter in the future  cannot be predicted primarily because of the changing character of environmental requirements that may be enacted within the various jurisdictions where we operate 
as a result of the foregoing risks  project expenditures  production quantities and rates and cash operating costs  among other things  could be materially and adversely affected and could differ materially from anticipated expenditures  production quantities and rates and costs 
in addition  estimated production dates could be delayed materially 
any such events could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the development and operation of our mining projects involve numerous uncertainties that could affect the feasibility or profitability of such projects 
mine development projects typically require a number of years and significant expenditures during the development phase before production is possible 
development projects are subject to the completion of successful feasibility studies and environmental and socioeconomic assessments  the issuance of necessary governmental permits and receipt of adequate financing 
the economic feasibility of development projects is based on many factors such as estimation of mineral reserves and mineral resources  mining rate  dilution and recovery  anticipated metallurgical characteristics of the ore and gold recovery rates  environmental and community considerations including resettlement  permitting and approvals  future gold prices  and anticipated capital and operating costs 
estimates of proven and probable mineral reserves and operating costs developed in feasibility studies are based on reasonable assumptions including geologic and engineering analyses and may not prove to be accurate 
the management of mine development projects and the start up of new operations are complex 
completion of development and the commencement of production may be subject to delays 
any of the following events  among others  could affect the profitability or economic feasibility of a project unanticipated changes in grade and tonnage of ore to be mined and processed  unanticipated adverse geotechnical conditions  incorrect data on which engineering assumptions are made  costs of constructing and operating a mine in a specific environment  cost of processing and refining  availability of economic sources of power and fuel  availability of qualified staff  adequacy of water supply  adequate access to the site including competing land uses such as agriculture and illegal mining  unanticipated transportation costs and shipping incidents and losses  significant increases in the cost of diesel fuel  cyanide or other major components of operating costs  government regulations and changes to existing regulations including regulations relating to prices  royalties  duties  taxes  permitting  restrictions on production  quotas on exportation of minerals  protection of the environment and agricultural lands  including bonding requirements  fluctuations in gold prices  and accidents  labor actions and force majeure events 
adverse effects on the operations or further development of a project could also adversely affect our business including our ability to achieve our production estimates  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we need to continually discover  develop or acquire additional mineral reserves for gold production and a failure to do so would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
because mines have limited lives based on proven and probable mineral reserves  we must continually replace and expand mineral reserves as our mines produce gold 
we are required to estimate mine life in connection with our estimation of reserves  but our estimates may not be correct 
in addition  mine life would be shortened if we expand production or if we lose reserves due to changes in gold price or operating costs 
our ability to maintain or increase our annual production of gold will be dependent in significant part on our ability to bring new mines into production and to expand or extend the life of existing mines 
gold exploration is highly speculative  involves substantial expenditures  and is frequently non productive 
gold exploration involves a high degree of risk 
exploration projects are frequently unsuccessful 
few prospects that are explored are ultimately developed into producing mines 
we cannot assure you that our gold exploration efforts will be successful 
the success of gold exploration is dependent in part on the following factors the identification of potential gold mineralization based on surface analysis  availability of prospective land  availability of government granted exploration and exploitation permits  the quality of our management and our geological and technical expertise  and the funding available for exploration and development 
substantial expenditures are required to determine if a project has economically mineable mineralization 
it could take several years to establish proven and probable mineral reserves and to develop and construct mining and processing facilities 
because of these uncertainties  we cannot assure you that current and future exploration programs will result in the discovery of mineral reserves  the expansion of our existing mineral reserves or the development of mines 
we face competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties 
we face strong competition from other mining companies in connection with the acquisition of properties producing  or capable of producing gold 
many of these companies have greater financial resources  operational experience and technical capabilities 
as a result of this competition  we might be unable to maintain or acquire attractive mining properties on terms we consider acceptable or at all 
consequently  our future revenues  operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
title to our mineral properties could be challenged 
we seek to confirm the validity of our rights to title to  or contract rights with respect to  each mineral property in which we have a material interest 
we have mining leases with respect to our bogoso prestea  wassa  prestea underground and hbb properties 
title insurance generally is not available  and our ability to ensure that we have obtained a secure claim to individual mineral properties or mining concessions is limited 
we generally do not conduct surveys of our properties until they have reached the development stage  and therefore  the precise area and location of such properties could be in doubt 
accordingly  our mineral properties could be subject to prior unregistered agreements  transfers or claims  and title could be affected by  among other things  undetected defects 
in addition  we might be unable to operate our properties as permitted or to enforce our rights with respect to our properties 
we depend on the services of key executives 
we are dependent on the services of key executives including our president and chief executive officer and chief financial officer  and a number of other highly skilled and experienced executive personnel 
due to the relatively small size of our management team  the loss of one or more of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
our increased use of contractors may expose us to a number of risks and increase our mining costs 
we have increased our use of mining contractors at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb 
the increased use of contractors subjects us to certain risks  some of which are outside our control  including our ability to negotiate agreements with contractors on acceptable terms  reduced control over those aspects of operations which are the responsibility of the contractor  failure of a contractor to perform under its agreement  interruption of operations or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases to do business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events  failure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  labor relation issues from a contractors workforce  and the potential to incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
our insurance coverage could be insufficient 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards generally  including adverse environmental conditions  industrial accidents  labor disputes  unusual or unexpected geological conditions  ground or slope failures  cave ins  fire damage  changes in the regulatory environment  marine transit and shipping damage and or losses  natural phenomena such as inclement weather conditions  floods and earthquakes  and political risks including expropriation and civil war 
such occurrences could result in damage to mineral properties or production facilities and equipment  personal injury or death  loss of legitimate title to properties  environmental damage to our properties or the properties of others  delays in mining  processing and development  monetary losses  and possible legal liability 
although we maintain insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  our insurance might not cover all the potential risks associated with our business 
we might also be unable to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums 
insurance coverage might not continue to be available or might not be adequate to cover any resulting liability 
moreover  insurance against risks such as environmental pollution or other hazards as a result of exploration and production is not generally available to us or to other companies in the mining industry on acceptable terms 
we might also become subject to liability for pollution or other hazards which we cannot insure against or which we might elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons 
losses from these events might cause us to incur significant costs that could have a material adverse effect upon our financial performance and results of operations 
we are dependent on information technology systems  which are subject to certain risks  including cybersecurity risks and data leakage risks 
we are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our operations 
any significant breakdown  invasion  virus  cyber attack  security breach  destruction or interruption of these systems by employees  others with authorized access to our systems  or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our operations 
to the extent any invasion  cyber attack or security breach results in disruption to our operations  loss or disclosure of  or damage to  our data or confidential information  our reputation  business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient 
although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks  we may suffer such losses in the future 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
governmental and regulatory risks as a holding company  limitations on the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make distributions to us could adversely affect the funding of our operations 
we are a holding company that conducts operations through foreign principally ghanaian subsidiaries and joint ventures  and substantially all of our assets consist of equity in these entities 
accordingly  any limitation on the transfer of cash or other assets between the parent corporation and these entities  or among these entities  could restrict our ability to fund our operations efficiently  or to repay the convertible debentures or other debt 
any such limitations  or the perception that such limitations might exist now or in the future  could have an adverse impact on available credit and our valuation and stock price 
in the government of ghana made a number of changes to the mining fiscal regime  and proposed significant additional changes that will have a significant impact on our overall costs 
in  the government of ghana made several changes to the mining fiscal regime and proposed significant additional changes  which if implemented  would result in an increase in the overall corporate tax payable by mining companies in ghana 
the government increased the income tax rate from to and disallowed expenditures from one mining area as a deduction from revenues in a separate mining area belonging to the same company in determining the company taxable income for tax purposes 
further it instituted certain tax depreciation limits 
additionally  the government announced its intent to introduce a windfall profit tax on mining companies in in late  the government announced that it intends to establish a tax stability renegotiation team which plans to review the existing tax stability agreements of mining companies operating in ghana 
while our mines do not have tax stability agreements  it is not clear at this time if the tax stability renegotiation team will review our deeds of warranty which specify certain tax agreements for our properties 
although the specific details of these proposed changes have not been made available  if these changes are implemented  they would have a significant impact on our profitability and financial resources 
we are subject to changes in the regulatory environment where we operate which may increase our costs of compliance 
our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to extensive regulation governing various matters  including licensing  production  taxes  disposal of process water or waste rock  toxic substances  development and permitting  exports and imports  labor standards  mine and occupational health and safety  environmental protection and corporate responsibility  and mine rehabilitation and closure plans 
compliance with these regulations increases the costs of the following planning  designing  drilling  operating  developing  constructing  and closure  reclamation and rehabilitation and post closure 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current laws and regulations in ghana and elsewhere 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and reinterpretation 
amendments to current laws and regulations governing operations and activities of mining companies or more stringent implementation or interpretation of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on us 
these factors could cause a reduction in levels of production and delay or prevent the development or expansion of our properties in ghana 
the implementation of changes in regulations that limit the amount of proceeds from gold sales that could be withdrawn from ghana could also have a material adverse impact on us  as bogoso prestea and wassa hbb are currently our only sources of internally generated operating cash flows 
environmental bonding requirements are under review in ghana and bonding requirements may be increased 
as part of its periodic assessment of mine reclamation and closure costs  the ghana epa reviews the adequacy of reclamation bonds and guarantees 
in certain cases  it has requested higher levels of bonding based on its findings 
if the epa were to require additional bonding at our properties  it may be difficult  if not impossible  to provide sufficient bonding 
if we are unable to meet any such increased requirements or negotiate an acceptable solution with the government of ghana  our operations and exploration and development activities in ghana may be materially adversely affected 
the government of ghana has the right to increase its interest in certain subsidiaries 
in accordance with the minerals and mining act  act  the government of ghana has a carried interest in the mineral operations of ghanaian mining companies 
the carried interest comes into existence at the time the government issues a mining license 
as such  the government of ghana currently has a carried interest in our subsidiaries that own the bogoso prestea properties and the wassa hbb properties 
under act  the government of ghana has the right to acquire a special share or golden share in such subsidiaries at any time for no consideration or such consideration as the government of ghana and such subsidiaries might agree  and a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by such subsidiaries 
a golden share carries no voting rights and does not participate in dividends  profits or assets 
while the government of ghana has not sought to exercise any of these rights at our properties  any such attempts to do so in the future could adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to risks relating to exploration  development and operations in foreign countries 
our assets and operations are affected by various political and economic uncertainties in the countries where we operate  including war  civil unrest  terrorism  coups or other violent or unexpected changes in government  political instability and violence  expropriation and nationalization  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits  and contracts  illegal mining  changes in taxation policies  unilaterally imposed increases in royalty rates  such as the increase in royalty rates imposed by the government of ghana  effective march  which changed the method of calculating the royalties from not less than and not more than of a mine total mineral revenues to a flat rate of of mineral revenues  restrictions on foreign exchange and repatriation  and changing political conditions  currency controls  and governmental regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local contractors or require foreign contractors to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
illegal mining has occurred on our properties which is difficult to control  can disrupt our business and can expose us to liability 
we continue to experience illegal mining activity on our mining and exploration properties 
most of this activity is on our prestea south properties 
while we are proactively working with local  regional and national governmental authorities to obtain protection of our property rights  any action on the part of such authorities may not occur  may not fully address our problems or may be delayed 
in addition to the impact on our mineral reserves and non reserves  the presence of illegal miners can lead to project delays and disputes and delays regarding the development or operation of commercial gold deposits 
illegal miners could cause environmental damage or other damage to our properties  or personal injury or death  for which we could potentially be held responsible 
illegal miners may work on other of our properties from time to time  and they may in the future increase their presence and have increased negative impacts such as those described above on such other properties 
our activities are subject to complex laws  regulations and accounting standards that can adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations  the ability to operate our mines and our financial results 
our business  mining operations and exploration and development activities are subject to extensive canadian  united states  ghanaian and other foreign  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations governing exploration  development  production  exports  taxes  labor standards  waste disposal  protection of the environment  reclamation  historic and cultural resource preservation  mine safety and occupational health  toxic substances  reporting and other matters  as well as accounting standards 
compliance with these laws  regulations and standards or the imposition of new such requirements could adversely affect operating and development costs  the timing of operations and the ability to operate and financial results 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
annually  we are required to test our internal controls over financial reporting to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and share price 
market risks the market price of our common shares has experienced volatility and could continue to do so in the future 
our common shares are listed on the nyse mkt  the toronto stock exchange and the ghana stock exchange 
companies with market capitalizations similar to ours have experienced substantial volatility in the past  often based on factors unrelated to the financial performance or prospects of the companies involved 
these factors include macroeconomic developments in north america and globally and market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries 
our share price is also likely to be significantly affected by short term changes in gold prices or in our financial condition or results of operations as reflected in our quarterly earnings reports 
other factors unrelated to our performance that could have an effect on the price of our common shares include the following the extent of analytical coverage available to investors concerning our business could be limited if investment banks with research capabilities do not continue to follow our securities  the trading volume and general market interest in our securities could affect an investor ability to trade significant numbers of common shares  the size of the public float in our common shares may limit the ability of some institutions to invest in our securities  and a substantial decline in our stock price that persists for a significant period of time could cause our securities to be delisted from nyse mkt  the toronto stock exchange and or the ghana stock exchange  further reducing market liquidity 
as a result of any of these factors  the market price of our common shares at any given point in time might not accurately reflect our long term value 
stock markets in general have recently experienced higher levels of volatility 
securities class action litigation often has been brought against companies following periods of market price volatility that affects the market price of particular securities without regard to the performance of the company whose stock price is affected 
we could in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and damages and divert management attention and resources 
investors could have difficulty or be unable to enforce certain civil liabilities on us  our directors and our experts 
golden star is a canadian corporation 
a majority of our assets are located outside of canada and the united states  and our principal office was formerly located in the united states 
it might not be possible for investors to collect judgments obtained in canadian courts predicated on the civil liability provisions of canadian or us securities legislation 
it could also be difficult for investors to effect service of process in connection with any action brought in the united states upon our directors and officers 
execution by united states courts of any judgment obtained against us  or any of the directors or executive officers  in the united states courts would be limited to our assets or the assets of such persons in the united states 
the enforceability in canada of united states judgments or liabilities in original actions in canadian courts predicated solely upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the united states is doubtful 
there are certain us federal income tax risks associated with ownership of golden star common shares 
holders of our common shares or options  rights and warrants to purchase our common shares or convertible debentures  referred to as equity securities  who are us taxpayers should consider that we could be considered to be a passive foreign investment company pfic for us federal income tax purposes 
although we do not believe that we were a pfic for the year ended december   and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  we have not undertaken  and do not plan to undertake  a formal study of whether or not we are a pfic for any taxable year  and we undertake no obligation to advise holders of our equity securities as to our pfic status for any year 
the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  and can be subject to uncertainties  and we cannot assure you that we will not be a pfic for the year ended december  or any future year 
if we are a pfic for any year  any person who holds our equity securities who is a us person for us income tax purposes  referred to as a us holder  and whose holding period for those equity securities includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic  generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our equity securities including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free also would be treated as excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of options  rights  warrants or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the holder holding period in the option or convertible debt 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the taxpayer actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carry forwards and would be subject to interest charges to reflect the value of the us income tax deferral 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qualified electing fund and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
these elections are not available to us holders with respect to options  rights and warrants to acquire our common shares or with respect to convertible debentures 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders of our common shares the annual information that would be necessary to make a qualified electing fund election 
additional special adverse rules also apply to investors who are us holders who own our common shares if we are a pfic and have a non us subsidiary that is also a pfic 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our equity securities if we are a pfic 
the conversion feature of the convertible debentures could limit increases in the trading price of our common shares 
the conversion price of the convertible debentures is per share 
during periods when our share price is greater than the conversion price  this conversion feature may limit the increase in the price of our common shares  since any increase in the stock price above the conversion price will make it more likely that the convertible debentures will be converted  thereby exerting a downward pressure on the market price of the common shares 
the existence of outstanding rights to purchase or acquire common shares could impair our ability to raise capital 
as of march   there were options outstanding to purchase up to  common shares at exercise prices ranging from cdn to cdn per share 
in addition   common shares are available for future issuance under our stock option plans 
furthermore  million common shares are currently issuable upon conversion of the convertible debentures additional shares may be issuable to debenture holders in certain circumstances 
during the life of the options  convertible debentures and other rights  the holders are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of common shares  with a resulting dilution in the interest of the other shareholders 
our ability to obtain additional financing during the period such rights are outstanding could be adversely affected  and the existence of the rights could have an adverse effect on the price of our common shares 
the holders of the options  convertible debentures and other rights can be expected to exercise or convert them at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital by a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by the outstanding rights 
current global financial conditions may affect our ability to obtain financing and may negatively affect our asset values and results of operations 
global financial conditions during recent years have been characterized by heightened volatility and uncertainty 
as a result  access to financing has been negatively impacted  which may affect our ability to obtain equity or debt financing in the future on favorable terms 
additionally  these factors  as well as other related factors  may cause decreases in asset values that are deemed to be other than temporary  which may result in impairment losses 
if such increased levels of volatility and market turmoil continue or worsen  our operations could be adversely impacted and the trading price of our common shares may be adversely affected

we remain in frequent contact with the mineral commission and expect to receive all permits upon completion of administrative processing 
mining in ghana ghanaian ownership and special rights ghana is situated on the west coast of africa  approximately km north of the equator on the gulf of guinea 
accra  the capital city of ghana  is located almost exactly on the prime meridian 
the former british colony changed its name from the gold coast to ghana on achieving independence on march  ghana is now a republic with a population of approximately million people and a democratically elected government 
english remains the official and commercial language 
the total land area of the country is approximately  square kilometers and the topography is relatively flat 
ghana has a tropical climate with two rainy seasons and two dry seasons each year 
the natural vegetation in the western region where golden star resources has its two operations is moist tropical forest  now found only in forest reserves  with a majority of the land converted to agricultural pursuits 
rights to explore and develop a mine are administered by the minister of lands and natural resources  through the minerals commission  a governmental organization designed to promote and regulate the development of ghana mineral wealth in accordance with the minerals and mining act of act  which came into effect in march mining act 
a company or individual can apply to the minerals commission for a renewable exploration license granting exclusive rights to explore for a particular mineral in a selected area for an initial period not exceeding three years 
when exploration has successfully delineated a mineral reserve  an application may be made to the minerals commission for conversion to a mining lease  granting a company the right to produce a specific product from the concession area  normally for a period of to years or a lesser period that may be agreed upon with the applicant 
the mining act requires that any person who intends to acquire a controlling share of the equity of any mining company that has been granted a mining lease  must first give notice of its intent to the government of ghana and also obtain its consent prior to acquiring a controlling share 
under the mining act  the government of ghana holds a free carried interest in all companies that hold mining leases 
the free carried interest entitles the government to a pro rata share of future dividends 
the government has no obligation to contribute development capital or operating expenses 
gsbpl and gswl owe million and million  respectively  to golden star or its subsidiaries as of december   for past advances and interest on these advances  and these amounts would be repaid before payment of any dividends to the government 
under the mining act  the government of ghana is empowered to acquire a special or golden share in any mining company 
the special share would constitute a separate class of shares with such rights as the government and the mining company might agree 
though deemed a preference share  it could be redeemed without any consideration or for a consideration determined by the mining company and payable to the holder on behalf of the government of ghana 
in the absence of such agreement  the special share would have the following rights it would carry no voting rights but the holder would be entitled to receive notice of  and to attend and speak at  any general meeting of the members or any separate meeting of the holders of any class of shares  it could only be issued to  held by  or transferred to the government of ghana or a person acting on behalf of the government  the written consent of the holder would be required for all amendments to the organizational documents of the company  the voluntary winding up or liquidation of the company  or the disposal of any mining lease  or the whole or any material part of the assets of the company  it would not confer a right to participate in the dividends  profits or assets of the company or a return of assets in a winding up or liquidation of the company  and the holder of a special share may require the company to redeem the special share at any time for no consideration or for a consideration determined by the company 
gsbpl and gswl have not issued  nor to date been requested to issue  a special share to the government of ghana 
the government of ghana has a pre emptive right to purchase all gold and other minerals produced by mines in ghana 
the purchase price would be agreed by the government of ghana and the mining company  or the price established by any gold hedging arrangement between the company and any third party approved by the government  or the publicly quoted market price prevailing for the minerals or products as delivered at the mine or plant where the right of preemption was exercised 
the government of ghana has agreed to take no preemptive action pursuant to its right to purchase gold or other minerals so long as mining companies sell gold in accordance with certain procedures approved by the bank of ghana 
ghanaian royalty ghanaian law sets mineral royalties at a flat rate of of mineral revenues 
we paid royalties of million  million and million in   and  respectively 
ghanaian corporate tax in the government increased the corporate income tax rate from to of taxable income for mining companies 
additionally  the use of capital allowances tax depreciation was changed in to be deductible at a flat rate of over a five year period instead of an deduction in the year that the capital spending was incurred and the majority of the remaining deductible over the following two years 
during  the government enacted new tax regulations that would disallow expenditures from one mining area as a deduction from revenues in a separate mining area belonging to the same company in determining the company taxable income for tax purposes 
the government also announced in  but has not yet enacted  its intent to introduce a windfall profit tax on mining companies 
the details of these two tax changes have not been made publicly available  and we are thus not able to determine the impact of these proposed new taxes  if any  on our operations 
in  the government announced that it intends to establish a tax stability renegotiation team which plans to review the existing tax stability agreements of mining companies operating in ghana 
while our mines do not have tax stability agreements  it is not clear at this time if the tax stability renegotiation team will review our deeds of warranty which specify certain tax agreements for our properties 
environmental and other laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions where we operate  all phases of our exploration  project development  and operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations may define  among other things  air and water quality standards  waste management requirements  and closure and rehabilitation obligations 
in general  environmental legislation is evolving to require more strict operating standards  more detailed socioeconomic and environmental impact assessments for proposed projects  and a heightened degree of accountability for companies and their officers  directors  and employees for corporate social responsibility  and health and safety 
changes in environmental regulations  and the way they are interpreted by the regulatory authorities  could affect the way we operate  resulting in higher environmental and social operating costs that may affect the viability of our operations 
environmental matters in ghana  including those related to mining  fall primarily under the oversight of the environmental protection agency epa  with some responsibilities lying with the minerals commission 
the epa has rules and guidelines that govern environmental and socioeconomic impact assessments and statements  environmental management plans  mine operations  the quality of water discharges to the environment  environmental auditing and review  and mine closure and reclamation  among other matters to which our operations are subject 
additional provisions governing surface land uses by our stakeholders are provided in the mining act with further requirements being defined in the associated regulations that were published in we note a continuing trend toward substantially increasing environmental requirements and greater corporate social responsibility expectations in ghana 
this includes requirements for more permits  analysis  data gathering  community hearings  and negotiations than have been required typically in the past for both routine operational needs and for new development projects 
the trend to longer lead times in obtaining environmental permits has reached a point where we are no longer able to accurately estimate permitting times for our planning purposes 
the increases in permitting requirements could affect our environmental management activities including  but not limited to  tailings storage facilities  water management and rehabilitation and closure planning and implementation at our mines 
our mining  processing  development  and mineral exploration activities are also subject to various laws governing prospecting  development  production  taxes  labor standards  occupational health and safety  land claims of local people and other matters 
new rules and regulations may be enacted or existing rules and regulations may be modified and applied in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we use hazardous chemicals in our gold recovery activities  and thus generate environmental contaminants that may adversely affect air and water quality 
to mitigate these effects  we have established objectives to achieve regulatory requirements in all of our exploration  development  operation  closure  and post closure activities so that our employees  the local environment  and our stakeholder communities are protected and that the post closure land use contributes to the sustainability of the local economy 
in order to meet our objectives  we educate our managers so that they are committed to creating a culture that makes social and environmental matters an integral part of short term and long term operations and performance management systems  work with our employees so they understand and accept environmental and social policies and procedures as a fundamental part of the business  signed and publicly stated our support for the un global compact and completed our commitments that are provided in our communications on progress  establish  and continue to improve  operating standards and procedures that aim to meet or exceed requirements in relevant laws and regulations  the commitments made in our environmental impact statements  environmental and socioeconomic management plans  rehabilitation and closure plans  and any international protocols to which we are a signatory  incorporated environmental and human rights performance requirements into all relevant contracts  provide training to employees and contractors in environmental matters  regularly prepare  review  update  and implement site specific environmental management and rehabilitation and closure plans  work to progressively rehabilitate disturbed areas in conformance with the site specific environmental management and rehabilitation and closure plans  consult local communities and regulators to provide us with input on our environmental management policies and procedures  regularly review our environmental performance  complete our resettlement projects in accordance with the international finance corporation performance standard on land acquisition and involuntary resettlement  and publicly report our social  health  safety  and environmental performance 
reclamation activities were ongoing at both wassa hbb and bogoso prestea during to rehabilitate disturbed lands and reduce some of the long term liabilities including re profiling waste dumps  capping hard rock with oxide materials  topsoil spreading and planting for both slope stabilization and long term rehabilitation 
our consolidated reclamation expenditures totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
the spending reflects backfilling of the plant north pit 
we believe all our operations in ghana are currently in substantial compliance with all environmental requirements 
corporate social responsibility in keeping with our health  safety and wellbeing  environmental  and community relations and human rights policies  we strive at all times to conduct our business as a responsible corporate citizen 
we believe our ongoing success in ghana depends on our continuing efforts to build good relations with our local stakeholder communities  and by reviewing broader stakeholder comments and addressing stakeholder concerns in our developing projects and ongoing operational activities 
we believe our success as an employer  as a neighbor  and as an important part of the local economy is furthered by contributing to the diversification of the local economy with initiatives such as our golden star oil palm project and by our support of community driven improvement projects through our golden star development foundation 
during  the development foundation worked with our local community mine consultation committees to fund and sponsor several community driven projects including public toilets  a community centre  continuing scholarships for local students  and supplying of medical advice in partnership with a european aid organization giz 
our oil palm project continued to advance during and now has hectares of palm oil trees under cultivation with fruit production increasing such that our small holder farmers on the bogoso plantation are now receiving sufficient income to become independent 
gsr also supports a skills training program for stakeholders aimed at local economic development 
the golden star skills training and employability program gsstep provides practical training for local people in construction and in high tech services such as cell phone repair 
we currently have about graduates who are now able to provide skilled services 
in our efforts to promote transparency in governance  we continue to work with the extractive industry transparency initiative  and throughout we published our payments to the government of ghana eg taxes  royalties  fees 
we furthered our work in human rights and against discrimination with a training program within golden star 
our commitment to the development of our stakeholder communities demonstrates golden star dedication to ghana and to sharing the success of our operations with our local communities 
in  we signed a series of community agreements with our bogoso stakeholder communities covering  amongst other things  local employment and community development projects 
as we continue to expand our community development programs  we plan to integrate more local people and communities into our economic development and outreach programs  so assisting the western region of ghana to achieve its full potential within the broader ghana development 
operating properties the bogoso prestea gold mine bogoso prestea consists of a gold mining and processing operation located along the ashanti trend in western ghana  approximately kilometers northwest of the town of tarkwa 
the mine site can be reached by paved roads from accra  ghana capital city  via tarkwa  a local commercial center 
bogoso and prestea are adjoining mining concessions that together cover approximately kilometers of strike along the southwest trending ashanti gold district 
mining areas at bogoso and prestea are linked to the bogoso processing plants by paved and gravel haul roads located on our properties 
there are two ore processing facilities at bogoso prestea and open pit mining methods are employed 
ore is hauled by truck from the pits to the processing plants 
equipment and facilities include the nominal million tonne per annum bogoso non refractory processing plant  the nominal million tonne per annum bogoso refractory processing plant  a fleet of haul trucks  loaders  drills and mining support equipment 
in addition  there are numerous ancillary support facilities including warehouses  maintenance shops  roadways  administrative offices  an employee residential complex  a water supply system  a stand by megawatt power plant  a medical clinic  and a tailings storage facility 
electric power is available locally from the ghana power grid 
we acquired bogoso and its non refractory processing plant in the prestea property was acquired in in july  we completed construction and development of the bogoso refractory processing plant 
bogoso prestea gold sales from both processing plants totaled  ounces in and  ounces in see the operating results for bogoso prestea below for additional details on historical production and operating costs 
ore for the bogoso refractory processing plant is mined at the bogoso north and chujah pits located a few kilometers north of the the refractory processing plant 
in february  the bogoso non refractory processing plant began processing non refractory ore from the the pampe mine located kilometers west of the plant 
in conjunction  the bogoso oxide plant was refurbished during the last quarter of in anticipation of processing pampe oxide and other non refractory ores from the bogoso area 
in addition to the currently active bogoso prestea operations described above  bogoso prestea assets include the several development properties  including dumasi  mampon  prestea south and prestea underground 
see development stage properties in ghana section below for a description of these properties 
geology at bogoso prestea bogoso prestea lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield along the ashanti trend located immediately south of the town of bogoso 
the area is dominated by a major northeast southwest trending structural fault zone referred to as the ashanti trend  which hosts our bogoso prestea operations as well as the obuasi and konongo gold deposits  among others 
parallel to the ashanti trend is the akropong trend  which hosts our pampe property as well as the ayanfuri deposit 
the akropong trend is approximately kilometers west of the ashanti trend in the bogoso region 
mineral reserves at bogoso prestea at december   bogoso prestea had proven and probable mineral reserves  including at dumasi  prestea south  mampon and pampe  of million tonnes grading grams per tonne containing approximately million ounces of gold before any reduction for recovery losses and the government of ghana minority interest 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table in item of this form k

the exploration focus will be on additional non refractory or free milling targets such as buesichem east and prestea south as well as definition drilling at mampon 
the wassa gold mine we own and operate the wassa gold mine located approximately kilometers east of bogoso prestea in southwest ghana 
the property  as now constituted  includes several open pit mines  the nominal million tonne per annum cil wassa plant with its crushing and grinding circuits  a fleet of mining equipment  a tailings storage facility and ancillary facilities  including an administration building  a warehouse  a maintenance shop  an megawatt stand by power generating facility and an employee residential complex 
electric power is available locally from the ghana power grid 
gswl also owns and operates the hwini butre and benso mines located km and km  respectively  south of wassa 
in  following completion of a km haul road  we started mining at benso and began hauling its ore to wassa for processing 
in may  following completion of a km road extension  the hwini butre mine began trucking ore to the wassa processing plant 
the benso and hwini butre mines include multiple open pits at both locations as well as mining equipment  equipment repair shops  warehouses and other ancillary support equipment and buildings 
mining was completed at benso in february mining is expected to continue at hwini butre through mid geology at wassa wassa lies within the eburnean tectonic province in the west african precambrian shield 
the proterozoic rocks that comprise most of the west african craton and host the major gold mineralization in ghana are subdivided into meta sedimentary and volcanic rocks of the birimian and tarkwaian sequences 
wassa is hosted within the same birimian volcano sedimentary greenstone package as bogoso prestea 
however  wassa is situated on the southeastern flank of the ashanti belt while bogoso and prestea occur along the northwestern flank 
the volcano sedimentary sequence hosting the wassa deposit has been affected by four deformational events spanning across the eoeburnean age billion years and eburnean orogeny age billion years 
the associated gold mineralization which has developed during the earlier eoeburnean deformational event and subsequently deformed during the eburnean event has resulted in a complex re folded vein system at the wassa mine 
during the eoeburnean deformation  a series of tight isoclinal folds and a strong fabric marked by chlorites  ankerite  and gold bearing elongated pyrite was developed along with numerous quartz ankerite veins 
the gold bearing veins along with the early isoclinal folds were re folded along a large scale synform during the eburnean event 
the early isoclinal folds control the distribution of high grade mineralization at depth which have been intercepted by the deep drilling program and will continue to be the main focus of the wassa exploration program 
geology at hwini butre and benso the hbb properties lie within the south eastern portion of the ashanti greenstone belt 
the eastern margin of this belt comprises inter bedded volcaniclastics while the western margin features a band of highly metamorphosed volcanics 
deposition of the tarkwaian sediments was followed by a period of dilation and the intrusion of mafic dikes and sills 
subsequent compression and re activation of faults led to intense folding and thrust faulting with associated shears  and this was accompanied by a regional metamorphic event 
the area hosts a range of intrusive lithologies and morphologies including the porphyritic dixcove granite complexes in the takoradi area 
the age of the various intrusives ranges from billion years to billion years 
the southern area of the ashanti belt is host to numerous gold occurrences which are believed to be related to late stages in the regional metamorphism and the commencement of the structural re activation events 
the majority of gold deposits occur as narrow discontinuous quartz veins generally  but not exclusively  hosted by metavolcanic sequences 
mineral reserves at wassa hbb as at december   wassa and hwini butre had proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes with an average grade of grams per tonne containing approximately million ounces of gold 
see the proven and probable mineral reserves table in item of this form k 
operating results for wassa hbb the following table displays historical operating results at wassa hbb 
for the years ended december  wassa hbb operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore and heap leach materials processed t grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz total cash cost oz royalties oz cash operating cost oz exploration at wassa hbb golden star main exploration focus for was delineation drilling on the wassa deposit 
exploration for the first half of utilized our own drilling fleet consisting of two multi purpose drill rigs 
the initial drilling results were encouraging  which prompted management to add an additional three contractor drill rigs in august and one more rig in december  bringing the total to six rigs at the end of the drilling production at wassa was drill holes totaling  meters 
interim mineral resource models were completed to enable year end mineral resource and mineral reserve updates which included in this report 
the resource model included only drilling results up to the end of august we expect to update the reserve and resource estimates in the second half of to incorporate additional drill results from september  onwards 
the drilling programs for wassa will continue to target the higher grade zones beneath wassa existing pits to further delineate the continuity of these zones 
see development projects in management discussion and analysis below for additional information on drilling at wassa during and our drilling plans for exploration activities on the hbb concessions during focused on drilling beneath the father brown and adoikrom pits  as well as drilling at pretsea and esuaso 
the drilling at father brown and adoikrom completed holes totaling  meters 
this drilling continued to intersect the father brown and adoikrom structures at depth which are characterized by westerly dipping quartz veins hosted within sheared diorite and granodiorite intrusives of the mpohor complex 
the company plans to continue testing these zones in pending the outcome of a scoping study for an underground mining operation which should be completed in the drilling program will continue through  further testing the manso and esuaso targets 
development properties prestea underground the prestea underground is an underground gold mine located approximately kilometers south of the bogoso processing plants 
gsbpl holds the mining lease to this property which provides gsbpl with a ownership with the government of ghana holding the remaining interest 
access to the mine site is via a paved road from bogoso 
the property consists of two access shafts with hoisting capabilities and extensive underground workings and support facilities 
the prestea underground was mined from the s until when mining ceased following an extended period of low gold prices in the late s and early s 
the prestea underground has produced approximately nine million ounces of gold  the second highest production of any mine in ghana 
the underground workings are extensive  reaching depths of approximately  meters and extending along a strike length of nine kilometers 
underground workings can currently be accessed via two surface shafts  one near the town of prestea central shaft and a second approximately four kilometers to the southwest at bondaye 
the prestea underground deposits are located along the same ashanti trend structure as are our bogoso deposits a few kilometers to the northeast and our prestea south deposits a few kilometers to the southwest  with most of the gold mineralization found in a tabular fault zone which dips steeply to the northwest 
a preliminary economic assessment pea study was completed in early that assessed the economic viability of an underground mining operation on a portion of this property  known as the west reef 
based on the results of pea  we are now working on a feasibility study scheduled for completion in the second quarter of see the development projects section of management discussion and analysis report below for additional discussion of this property 
we have budgeted spending of approximately million in on development projects and equipment for the underground operations 
geology of prestea underground the prestea concession lies on the western margin of the ashanti greenstone belt  which is located in the west african craton 
the greenstone belt is composed primarily of paleoproterozoic metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks that are divided into the birimian supergroup and the tarkwa group 
both units are intruded by abundant granitoids and host numerous hydrothermal gold deposits such as those found in the obuasi and prestea mines and paleo placer deposits such as those found in tarkwa and teberebie mines 
the prestea deposit can be classified as an orogenic mesothermal gold deposit where two main types of gold mineralization have been identified 
the most common type of mineralization is fault fill quartz veins along fault zones and second order structures  while the second type of mineralization is associated with brecciated zones hosted in iron rich volcanic lenses 
dumasi dumasi is bogoso largest undeveloped ore body located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plants containing mineral reserves of million tonnes grading gram per tonne for million ounces of in situ gold and million ounces of recoverable gold 
we expect to commence mining the pit in early  and that it will be the major source of ore feed to the bogoso refractory processing plant for several years and will also send significant amounts of non refractory ore to the bogoso non refractory processing plant as well 
planned expenditures in are approximately million 
mampon the mampon deposit is located approximately kilometers north east of the bogoso non refractory processing plant containing million tonnes of probable mineral reserves at an average gold grade of gram per tonne or million ounces in situ 
this project will employ open pit mining methods and the ore will be hauled by truck to the bogoso processing plants once mining commences 
the permitting process in now underway 
we plan to commence construction of a kilometer haul road to mampon in and to initiate mining by late the initial ore will be non refractory but as mining proceeds deeper into the pit  refractory ore will mined as well 
we expect to spend approximately million on mampon development activities during prestea south properties the prestea south project is located on the ashanti trend  southwest of the town of prestea and approximately kilometers southwest of the bogoso processing plants 
gold mineralization is associated with the same ashanti trend fault structure that continues to the north through our bogoso and prestea properties 
while various sections of the mineral resources at prestea south were mined by prior owners using underground methods  the near surface non refractory mineral resources have not been extensively mined  and there are also refractory mineral resources accessible by open pit mining 
our past exploration efforts have identified several deposits along this trend which can be mined by surface mining methods 
we have received mining permits for this area and have applied for environmental permits 
we expect to initiate development at prestea south  including its kilometer haul road extension  once the environmental permits are received 
the prestea south non refractory ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso non refractory plant 
the prestea south refractory ore will be processed through the bogoso refractory plant 
we now expect to initiate mining at the prestea south pits by early and our development expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
as of december   the prestea south properties had total proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes grading grams per tonne containing approximately million ounces 
bogoso tailings recovery project construction is essentially complete at our hydraulic tailings recovery system at bogoso which is designed to feed tailings from a decommissioned bogoso tailings storage facility directly into the bogoso non refractory plant cil circuit 
all environmental permits needed for start up have been received 
while the grade of the tailings material is lower than that of the ores typically treated in the bogoso oxide plant in the past  operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings have low mining costs and can be fed directly into the existing cil circuit  thereby resulting in lower overall processing costs 
it is expected that this material will be a supplemental feed to non refractory ores mined from pampe and other non refractory ore sources 
exploration properties akropong trend properties the akropong properties are located along a fault structure which roughly parallels the ashanti trend and is located approximately kilometers to the west of our bogoso refractory plant 
exploration work at pampe and afranse were limited in the pampe mineral resource model was updated in utilizing results from the drilling undertaken in we have had challenges with the community allowing access for further exploration on several of our properties along this trend  but discussions are underway to address their concerns 
dunkwa properties the dunkwa properties  are located along the ashanti trend  northeast of our bogoso mining lease  and consist of two prospecting licenses  mansiso and asikuma  the latter hosting our mampon deposit 
the exploration programs on the dunkwa properties were limited to a rotary air blast drilling program testing a geophysical conductor located east of the opon deposit on the mansiso prospecting license 
the initial results were however not encouraging 
late in we initiated community consultations to resume exploration work on the mampon deposit where waste dump sterilization  resource conversion and in fill drilling programs have been budgeted for early in anticipation of the mining lease  the environmental impact assessment study which was initiated during  continued through other exploration stage properties in africa cote d ivoire exploration work in cote d ivoire this year involved a deep auger drilling program  designed to test the gold in soil anomalies over the amelekia permit  with results confirming the sub surface gold anomalies 
the amelekia  abengourou and agboville licenses were renewed in  for a period of two years 
in addition to these three licenses in cote d ivoire  we submitted seven new applications in along mineralized trends throughout the country 
in  we plan to drill the deep soil anomalies at amelika either on our own or through a joint venture with other exploration companies operating in cote d ivoire 
burkina faso in october  we granted true gold mining inc tgm  formerly riverstone resources inc  an option to purchase our goulagou and rounga concessions in burkina faso 
exploration programs in and were managed and implemented by tgm and mainly consisted of infill reverse circulation drilling 
in december  tgm informed us that they intended to exercise their purchase option for these two properties and the sale was completed in february upon receipt of million of cash and million tgm common shares

under the treaty  the rate of withholding tax is reduced to if the holder is the beneficial owner of the dividends or if the holder is a company that owns at least of the company voting stock and beneficially owns the dividend 
dividends paid to religious  scientific  charitable and similar tax exempt organizations and pension organizations that are resident and exempt from tax in the us and that have complied with the administrative procedures specified in the treaty are exempt from this canadian withholding tax

currently  our common shares do not derive their value principally from real property situated in canada 
certain us federal income tax considerations the following discussion is a general summary of the material us federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common shares by a holder of our common shares that is an individual resident of the united states or a united states corporation a us holder 
this summary is general in nature and does not address the effects of any state or local taxes  us federal estate  gift  or generation skipping taxes  or the tax consequences in jurisdictions other than the united states 
in addition  this discussion does not discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be relevant to investors subject to special treatment under us federal income tax law including  for example  owners of or more of the voting shares of the company 
this summary is based on the us internal revenue code of  as amended which we refer to as the code  the regulations promulgated thereunder  court decisions and published rulings of the internal revenue service the irs  as in effect on the date hereof  and the convention between the united states of america and canada with respect to taxes on income and on capital signed on september   as amended and currently in force which we refer to as the treaty  and does not take into account the possible effect of future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions 
we will not request any rulings from the irs or obtain any opinions from counsel on the tax consequences described below  or on any other issues 
the irs or a court might reach a contrary conclusion with respect to the issues addressed herein if the matter were to be contested 
future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein  and any such changes or decisions may have a retroactive effect with respect to the matters discussed herein 
this discussion assumes that we are not  and will not become  a controlled foreign corporation as determined for us income tax purposes 
you should consult your own advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the acquisition  ownership and disposition of our common shares in light of your particular circumstances 
sale or other disposition of our common shares subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder that sells or otherwise disposes of our common shares will recognize capital gain or loss for us federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between i the us dollar value of the amount realized on the sale or disposition and ii the adjusted tax basis  determined in us dollars  of those common shares 
any such capital gains will be taxed as long term capital gains if the us holder holding period in the common shares exceeds one year at the time of the sale or other disposition 
long term capital gains of individuals are generally subject to preferential maximum federal income tax rates 
the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations 
distributions we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
however  subject to the passive foreign investment company rules discussed below  a us holder must include in gross income as dividend income the gross amount of any distribution including the amount of any canadian withholding tax thereon paid by the company out of its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for us federal income tax purposes with respect to our common shares 
a distribution on our common shares in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will be treated as a tax free return of capital to the extent of the us holder adjusted tax basis in such common shares thus reducing  but not below zero  the adjusted tax basis of such common shares  and thereafter as gain from the sale or exchange of common shares 
see sale or other disposition of our common shares above 
except as described below  dividends received by an individual us holder would be taxed as qualified dividend income to such us holder and will generally be subject to the same preferential maximum federal income tax rates that apply to long term capital gains 
however  dividend income will not be qualified dividend income and will be taxed at ordinary income rates if i the us holder fails to hold the common shares for at least days during the day period beginning days before the ex dividend date  ii the irs determines that the treaty is not a comprehensive income tax treaty that entitles our dividends to qualified dividend treatment and our common shares are no longer readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states  or iii we are a passive foreign investment company as described in passive foreign investment company rules below for the taxable year in which the dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year 
for foreign tax credit limitation purposes  dividends paid by us will be income from sources outside the united states 
subject to various limitations  canadian withholding taxes will be treated as foreign taxes eligible for credit against a us holder us federal income tax liability 
the limitation on foreign taxes eligible for credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income 
dividend income generally will constitute passive category income  or in the case of certain us holders  general category income 
the use of foreign tax credits is subject to complex conditions and limitations 
in lieu of a credit  a us holder who itemizes deductions may elect to deduct all of such holder foreign taxes in the taxable year 
a deduction does not reduce us tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit  but the deduction for foreign taxes is not subject to the same limitations applicable to foreign tax credits 
us holders are urged to consult their own tax advisers regarding the availability of foreign tax credits 
passive foreign investment company rules a non us corporation will be classified as a passive foreign investment company a pfic in any taxable year in which  after taking into account the income and assets of certain subsidiaries  either i at least of its gross income is passive income  or ii at least of the average value of its assets is attributable to assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income 
whether or not we will be classified as a pfic in any taxable year is a factual determination and will depend upon our assets  the market value of our common shares  and our activities in each year and is therefore subject to change 
although we do not believe that we were a pfic for the year ended december   and do not expect to become a pfic in the foreseeable future  we have not undertaken  and do not plan to undertake  a formal study of whether or not we are a pfic for any taxable year  and we undertake no obligation to advise us holders as to our pfic status for any year 
the tests for determining pfic status depend upon a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control and can be subject to uncertainties 
accordingly  we cannot assure us holders that we are not or will not be a pfic for the year ended december  or any future year 
if we are a pfic for any year  a us holder whose holding period for our common shares includes any portion of a year in which we are a pfic generally would be subject to a special adverse tax regime in respect of excess distributions 
excess distributions include certain distributions received with respect to pfic shares in a taxable year 
the gain recognized by a us holder on a sale or other transfer of our common shares including certain transfers that would otherwise be tax free  such as gifts  exchanges in a corporate reorganization  or grants as security for a loan also would be treated as excess distributions 
such excess distributions and gains would be allocated ratably to the us holder holding period 
for these purposes  the holding period of shares acquired either through an exercise of options or the conversion of convertible debentures includes the us holder holding period in the options or convertible debentures 
the portion of any excess distribution including gains treated as excess distributions allocated to the current year and to prior years before we first became a pfic would be includible as ordinary income in the current year 
the portion of any excess distribution allocated to all other prior years would be taxed at the highest marginal rate applicable to ordinary income for each such year regardless of the us holder actual marginal rate for that year and without reduction by any losses or loss carry forwards and would be subject to interest charges 
elections may be available to mitigate the adverse tax rules that apply to pfics the so called qualified electing fund and mark to market elections  but these elections may accelerate the recognition of taxable income and may result in the recognition of ordinary income 
the qualified electing fund and mark to market elections are not available to us holders with respect to options to acquire our common shares or convertible debentures 
further  if a us holder of options or convertible debentures were to make either a qualified electing fund or mark to market election with respect to common shares received on exercise of an option or convertible debenture  the us holder will be required to treat as an excess distribution subject to the adverse rules described above any appreciation inherent in the common shares when the election first becomes effective 
the mark to market election may be made only if  and so long as  our common shares are regularly traded on a qualified exchange or market 
we have not decided whether we would provide to us holders the annual information that would be necessary to make the qualified electing fund election 
if we are a pfic in a taxable year and own shares in another pfic a lower tier pfic  a us holder also will be subject to the excess distribution regime with respect to its indirect ownership of the lower tier pfic 
the mark to market election would not be available for any indirect ownership of a lower tier pfic 
a qef election can be made for a lower tier pfic  but only if we provide the us holder with the financial information necessary to make such an election 
special adverse rules that impact certain estate planning goals could apply to our common shares if we are a pfic 
special rules apply with respect to the calculation of the amount of the foreign tax credit with respect to excess distributions by a pfic 
in general  these rules allocate creditable foreign taxes over the us holder holding period for common shares and otherwise coordinate the foreign tax credit limitation rules with the pfic rules 
us holders who own common shares during any year in which we are a pfic must file irs form with their us federal income tax return for each year in which such holder owns our common shares  even if we subsequently would not be considered a pfic 
pursuant to code section f  as amended in  us holders may be required to provide additional information regarding ownership of an interest in a pfic 
as of the date hereof  the irs has suspended the reporting requirements imposed under code section f for pfic shareholders that are not otherwise required to file irs form medicare tax on unearned income for taxable years beginning after december   a surtax of is imposed on the net investment income of certain us holders to the extent that net investment income exceeds a certain threshold 
net investment income generally includes among other types of income dividends and net gains from the disposition of property other than property held in a non passive trade or business 
net investment income is reduced by deductions that are properly allocable to such income 
foreign currency transactions generally  amounts received by a us holder in foreign currency including dividends paid in foreign currency will be valued at the rate of exchange on the date of receipt 
the subsequent disposition of any foreign currency received including an exchange for us currency will generally give rise to ordinary gain or loss 
information reporting and backup withholding dividend payments made with respect to our common shares and proceeds from the sale or other disposition of our common shares may be subject to information reporting requirements and or to us backup withholding currently at a rate of 
in general  backup withholding will apply with respect to reportable payments made to a us holder unless i the us holder is a corporation or other exempt recipient  and if required  demonstrates such exemption  or ii the us holder furnishes the payer with a taxpayer identification number on irs form w in the manner required  certifies under penalty of perjury that such us holder is not currently subject to backup withholding and otherwise complies with the backup withholding requirements 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
rather  the amount of any backup withholding imposed on a payment to a holder will be allowed as a refund or a credit against such holder us federal income tax liability  provided that the required information is furnished to the internal revenue service 
item selected financial data the selected financial data set forth below are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended december     and  and should be read in conjunction with those financial statements and the notes thereto

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is designed to provide information that we believe necessary for an understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of our operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes information available to march  non gaap financial measures in this form k  we use the terms cash operating costs  cash operating cost per ounce and cash generated before working capital changes 
cost of sales as found in our statements of operations  includes all mine site operating costs  including the costs of mining  ore processing  maintenance  work in process inventory changes  mine site overhead as well as production taxes  royalties  mine site depreciation  depletion  amortization  asset retirement obligation accretion and by product credits  but excludes exploration costs  property holding costs  corporate office general and administrative expenses  foreign currency gains and losses  impairment charges  corporate business development costs  gains and losses on asset sales  interest expense  gains and losses on derivatives  gains and losses on investments and income tax expense benefit 
cash operating cost per ounce for a period is equal to cost of sales for the period less mining related depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  royalties  production taxes  accretion of asset retirement obligation costs  costs that meet the definition of a stripping activity asset under international financial reporting standards ifrs and operations related foreign currency gains and losses for the period  divided by the number of ounces of gold sold during the period

we monitor this measure monthly  comparing each month values to prior periods values to detect trends that may indicate increases or decreases in operating efficiencies 
we provide this measure to our investors to allow them to also monitor operational efficiencies of our mines 
we calculate this measure for both individual operating units and on a consolidated basis 
since cash operating costs do not incorporate revenues  changes in working capital and non operating cash costs  they are not necessarily indicative of operating profit or cash flow from operations as determined under gaap 
changes in numerous factors including  but not limited to  mining rates  milling rates  ore grade  gold recovery  costs of labor  consumables and mine site general and administrative activities can cause these measures to increase or decrease 
we believe that these measures are similar to the measures of other gold mining companies  but may not be comparable to similarly titled measures in every instance 
cash generated before working capital changes is calculated by subtracting the changes in working capital from net cash provided by operating activities as found in our statements of cash flows 
we calculate this non gaap measure to assist users of the data to better understand the cash generating results of our mining operations 
all these measures should be considered as non gaap financial measures as defined in sec regulation s k item and in applicable canadian securities laws and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
there are material limitations associated with the use of such non gaap measures 
trends and events for the year ended december  management changes and head office relocation plans it was announced on december   that golden star resources plans to relocate its corporate headquarters from denver colorado  united states to toronto ontario  canada by the middle of several management changes were also announced in conjunction with the office relocation including the following tom mair  ceo  elected to remain in denver and resign from his officer position and board seat effective december   sam coetzer  formerly chief operating officer for golden star  was appointed as president and ceo effective january  additionally  mr

sale of properties saramacca in  we entered into an agreement to sell our saramacca gold exploration project in suriname to newmont mining corporation 
in december  all requirements for the transfer were met and ownership and control of the saramacca project was turned over to newmont mining corporation for total consideration of million cash 
we received million cash in december and a final payment of million in early a million gain was recognized on this transaction in the fourth quarter 
burkina faso exploration properties in december  true gold mining inc tgm  formerly riverstone resources inc  notified us  per terms of a exploration earn in agreement  of their intent to exercise their purchase option for our goulagou and rounga exploration properties in burkina faso 
the sale of these exploration projects was completed in february upon our receipt of million of cash and million tgm common shares valued at million on the day of the sale 
on the day of the sale  we also held million tgm shares from earlier transactions with tgm 
the underlying properties carrying value had been written down to zero in prior periods  resulting in the recognition of a net gain of million on the completion of this disposition in the statement of operations 
since the sale of this property in february  we have sold million of our tgm shares leaving a balance of million shares at december  the price of tgm shares has dropped from per share at the february acquisition date to per share at december  as a result of the share sales and change in tgm share price  we recorded an unrealized loss of million in the statement of comprehensive income loss as of december   and the fair market value of the remaining shares was million 
convertible debentures and credit facilities convertible debentures on may   we issued million of convertible senior unsecured debentures due june  the convertible debentures in exchange for an aggregate of million of the principal amount outstanding of our convertible senior unsecured debentures due november  the convertible debentures  by way of privately negotiated transactions with certain holders of the convertible debentures 
we incurred a million loss on the extinguishment of the convertible debentures in the second quarter 
as a result  an aggregate of approximately million principal amount of convertible debentures remained outstanding as of may  in september  we redeemed an additional million of our convertible debentures by way of a privately negotiated transaction  and on november  the million of remaining principal amount of the convertible debentures was redeemed in cash 
see note to the accompanying financial statements for details of these transactions 
both the convertible debentures and convertible debentures are accounted for at fair value and marked to market each reporting period  and the corresponding gain loss on fair value is recorded in the statement of operations 
we recorded a loss of million related to the convertible debentures and convertible debentures as of december  the loss is mainly related to the increase in the fair value of the conversion feature of the convertible debentures 
the fair value of the conversion feature is calculated using a black scholes model  our share price rises  so does the value of the conversion feature of the convertible debentures 
expiry of revolving credit facility our million revolving credit facility expired on april   with no outstanding balance 
gold prices gold prices have generally trended upward during the last twelve years from a low of per ounce in to a high of  per ounce in september and prices have tracked between  per ounce and  per ounce during gold prices can fluctuate widely due to several factors such as changes in demand for physical gold  forward selling by gold mining companies  government actions  changes in the value of the us dollar and global mine production rates 
we realized an average of  per ounce for our gold shipments during and  per ounce for our gold shipments during restart of the bogoso non refractory plant ore processing was restarted at our bogoso non refractory plant in the first quarter of following completion of the plant renovation project in late feed for the restarted plant came initially from non refractory ore stockpiles at bogoso  but by march  the plant began receiving non refractory ore from our pampe mine  where mining was restarted in the third quarter of during  we expect most of the feed for the bogoso non refractory plant to come from pampe  with minor amounts of supplemental non refractory ores from the bogoso non refractory pits 
the bogoso non refractory plant produced and sold  ounces of gold in and nil ounces in see bogoso results of operations below for additional detail 
increases in mining costs while gold prices have trended upward in recent years  the mining industry has also experienced steady increases in mine operating costs including the costs of fuel  electric power  labor  explosives  mining equipment  equipment maintenance parts and chemicals consumed in the processing plants 
in addition  many governments around the world have increased mineral royalties  fees and income tax rates in recent years 
mining is an energy intensive industry using large quantities of electricity and fuel in the mining  transport  crushing  grinding and processing of ores  and as a result  a mine cost structure is sensitive to changes in fuel and electric power costs 
increases in crude oil prices from per barrel in early  to in excess of per barrel in have thus contributed to higher mining costs worldwide in recent years 
increasing fuel costs have also resulted in higher electric power costs in many areas including ghana 
the resource mining boom of recent years has constrained the availability of skilled mining personnel  which in turn has put upward pressure on labor costs 
it has also contributed to increases in mining equipment costs and longer lead times for new orders for large equipment 
despite the higher costs  our mining and processing costs per tonne have remained relatively flat since early reflecting our efforts to control operating costs 
increases in taxation and regulations increases in taxation in the first quarter of  the government of ghana enacted three changes to tax rules which apply to mining companies operating in ghana and further announced its intent to implement two additional changes 
changes enacted in rate increase a increase in income tax rates from in to in resulted in an increase in our deferred tax liability of approximately million as our deferred future income tax liabilities as of december  were raised to reflect the future impact of the new higher rate 
tax depreciation limits prior to  a mining company could add of the cost of its annual qualified capital spending to a tax asset pool known as capital allowances  which were immediately available  on an unlimited basis  to reduce taxable income 
once taxable income was reduced to zero in a given year  the remaining balance of the capital allowance pool was available for use in subsequent years 
under the new rule  only of a new year capital spending can be added to the capital allowance pool  and one fourth of the remaining is added to the pool in each of the subsequent four years 
this new rule delays the availability of capital allowances and could result in a smaller amount of available capital allowance in a given year which could result in a higher taxable income and accelerated cash taxes 
ring fencing the government new rules disallow the use of expenditures in one mining area as a deduction from revenues in a separate mining area leased by the same company in determining the company taxable income 
while no details have been released for the application of this new rule  the company expects this to have an immaterial impact on the calculation of tax expense in additional changes announced but not yet enacted windfall profit tax the government of ghana has stated its intention to implement a windfall profit tax on mining companies 
the government held hearings on this new development during the second and third quarters of  but has not yet finalized this new tax 
stability agreement renegotiations the government has established a tax stability renegotiation team that is reviewing the existing tax stability agreements of mining companies operating in ghana 
while our subsidiaries do not have tax stability agreements  it is not clear if the tax stability renegotiation team will also review our deeds of warranty which specify certain tax agreements for our properties 
since its inception  gswl has not paid income tax in ghana because ghana tax law allowed a deduction for the cost of past capital investments capital allowances when gswl calculated its taxable income 
during  gswl capital allowance pool was largely depleted and the tax law changes effective in placed new restrictions on use of capital allowances to offset taxable income 
as a result  wassa incurred taxable income in for the first time  and it is expected that gswl will pay approximately million of taxes to the government of ghana in related to gswl taxable income 
we expect wassa will continue to generate taxable income going forward and more specifically  it is expected that gswl will make provisional tax payments on its income 
recent changes in ghana mining laws the ghana minerals commission has announced changes in the regulations governing mining and exploration activities and mining operations in ghana including  among other things  health  safety and environmental standards of mining  incentives for local procurement of mining supplies and equipment  revised rules on employment of expatriate workers  compensation for land used in mining  mine inspections  mine and exploration permitting  use of explosives  mine closure and rehabilitation  stakeholder concerns  employees training  tailings storage facilities and working conditions 
the ghana chamber of mines is currently engaged in discussions designed to clarify the goals  intent and application of the new regulations as they will be implemented 
pending the outcome of the discussions  we are not in the position to evaluate their impact on golden star 
reserves and development activities increase in wassa hbb reserves golden star main exploration focus for was delineation drilling on the wassa main deposit 
exploration during the first half of utilized our own drilling fleet  consisting of two multi purpose drill rigs 
the initial drilling results were encouraging  which prompted management to add three additional contractor drill rigs in august and one more rig in december  bringing the total to six rigs at the end of the drilling production at wassa was drill holes totaling  meters 
interim resource models were completed to enable year end resource and reserve updates  which are included in this report 
as a result the company increased proven and probable mineral reserves by to million ounces of contained gold  relative to december  prestea underground west reef in may we completed a preliminary economic assessment pea of the west reef area of the prestea underground mine located near our bogoso mining operation in ghana

the higher gold sales were due to the re start of ore processing at bogoso non refractory processing plant in early  which contributed an incremental  ounces to s total sales as compared to nil in see bogoso results of operations section below for additional details of the non refractory plant 
realized gold prices averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce in consolidated cost of sales totaled million  up from million in the major factor in our cost increase was the start up of bogoso non refractory plant early in in addition  we saw higher prices for various key operating inputs during the year including fuel  cyanide  lime  grinding media and drilling costs 
higher cash operating costs also reflect an increase in waste mining activities at wassa hbb in as compared to during  million of operating costs were capitalized to ore stockpile inventories at bogoso prestea and wassa hbb as both mines built ore stockpiles to facilitate more optimal ore blending capabilities and to provide a continuous ore supply during the rainy seasons in ghana when mining activities are often impeded by wet conditions in the pits 
depreciation charges in were up million from due to the impact of a change in production mix on the units of production amortization costs in and more ounces sold at bogoso prestea and the royalty due to the government of ghana increased due to the higher revenues as compared to exploration expenses were lower than a year earlier reflecting generally lower exploration budgets during the major factor contributing to the reduction in corporate general and administrative expenses was million of corporate advisory consulting expense in that was not repeated in the lower consulting expense was partially offset by million of severance expenses see management changes in the trends and events section above 
property holding costs were up in from  reflecting activity related to the preparation of the pea for the prestea underground earlier in and preparation of a feasibility study  which is now underway 
derivative losses were nil in most of the the derivative losses in were related to gold price forward contracts  all of which expired by december   and we did not hold gold price forward contracts during we issued million of convertible debentures in may the convertible debentures are convertible into common shares at a conversion rate of common shares per  principal amount equal to an initial conversion price of per share  or approximately above the closing share price on the day prior to the date the convertible debentures were issued 
subsequent to the issuance date  the price of our common shares increased  reaching per share by december  the convertible debentures were marked to market at december   increasing the fair value of the liability 
as a result we recorded a non cash loss of million 
this compares to a million fair value gain adjustment for our convertible debentures as of december   the gain was primarily driven by falling share prices during which resulted in a lower value of the option feature and a lower liability 
the million gain on sale of investments is related to the sale of two of our exploration properties during the first was a sale of our exploration properties in burkina faso where we recognized a million gain and the second was related to the sale of saramacca  our exploration properties in suriname where we recognized a gain of million 
see the trends and events section above for more detail on these sales 
the increase in income taxes over s level was caused by higher ghanaian taxable income at gswl in and by an increase in ghanaian income tax rates early in  which caused a million increase in gswl tax liability 
consolidated financial results include a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share as compared to a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share in our mine operating margin of million increased million from million in in addition  we achieved a reduction in several non operating expenses as compared to including lower exploration expense  lower corporate general and administrative expense costs and lower derivative losses 
but these cost reductions were more than offset by a non cash loss in fair value of our convertible debentures and by higher income tax expense  resulting in the larger loss year over year

bogoso prestea restarted the non refractory processing plant in early and opened the non refractory pampe pit in late which supplied a majority of the ore feed to the non refractory plant during the non refractory plant processed  tonnes of ore in which yielded  ounces in as compared to nil in bogoso prestea revenues totaled million during  up million from million in the increase in revenues was related to the  ounces from the non refractory plant during in addition  bogoso prestea realized gold price averaged  per ounce in  higher than the realized  per ounce in bogoso cash operating cost totaled million in  up from million in while the refractory operation cut back on its waste mining in  the tonnes mined at the non refractory operation essentially offset this  resulting in total tonnes mined at bogoso prestea similar to what were mined in as a result  total mining costs were similar to before the non refractory mining operations was initiated 
however  start up of the non refractory plant in resulted in an increase in processing costs at bogoso and this accounted for most of the increase in bogoso prestea total operating costs as compared to approximately million of pre stripping costs at the new pampe pit were capitalized in and a total of million of bogoso prestea mining and processing costs were capitalized into in process and ore stockpile inventories during the inventory increase included filling the non refractory plant when it was started up in the first quarter of and the refractory operation added ore to its stockpiles to provide adequate ore feed to the refractory plant during the wet seasons and to allow for better ore blending 
refractory operations tonnes processed at bogoso refractory plant were up from  and gold recovery was higher but lower feed grades resulted in a drop in ounces produced as compared to the refractory plant sold  ounces for the year  down from  ounces in an increase in tonnes processed in reflects improvements achieved during in plant availability and utilization and better ore availability 
the drop in refractory ore grade reflects natural variability in the ore deposits being mined 
increasing amounts of fresh refractory ore  as mining progressed deeper into the bogoso refractory pits  improved gold recovery rates to in  up from in non refractory operations during  the non refractory plant processed  tonnes following its february re start 
gold recovery averaged in but fluctuated during the year from a low of in the first quarter to a high of in the third quarter as different types of ore became available 
fourth quarter recovery was down at 
a gravity circuit was added to the non refractory plant in the third quarter of which contributed to the increase in gold recovery 
the grade of the non refractory ore also fluctuated during the year depending on ore types mined 
the plant head grade was grams per tonne in the first quarter of  grams per tonne in the second quarter  grams per tonne in the third quarter and grams per tonne in the fourth quarter 
waste slips on the upper benches of the pampe pit early in temporarily delayed access to higher grade ores zones causing the drop in grades during the third and fourth quarters of in summary  bogoso prestea higher operating costs in were the result of the non refractory plant start up phase early in and the costs of removing the slip material at pampe  partially offset by capitalization of costs to stockpile and in process inventory 
during  bogoso prestea finished construction and start up of portions of a water treatment plant required to process plant waste water prior to its discharge to a local stream 
water is currently stored in an abandoned pit a few kilometers from the bogoso processing plants  when the treatment plant is completed  the stored water stored will be returned to bogoso for treatment along with bogoso then current discharge amounts 
engineering studies are underway evaluating various design changes that could reduce water treatment costs 
as discussed below in the development projects section  bogoso prestea has planned a major capital development program in and which is expected to bring several new projects into production over the next three years 
these plans include development of the dumasi deposit  the prestea underground west reef  mampon and prestea south 
these new development projects will require higher amounts of capital spending than in recent years  but they are also expected to increase gold output and lower future cost per ounce 
see liquidity outlook below for more details on capital investment spending at bogoso prestea in in addition to higher capital spending in  we are planning major pit wall push backs at bogoso prestea chujah and bogoso north pits during while these push backs will increase stripping rates and mining costs in  the push backs are designed to provide a more reliable supply of refractory ore to bogoso refractory plant in subsequent years beginning in improvements were made in our relationship with the communities that surround our operations during to this end we negotiated and signed a series of community agreements with our bogoso stakeholder communities during the year  covering amongst other things  local employment and community development projects 
we also expect to further expand our community development programs and to integrate more local people and communities into our economic development and outreach programs  to assist the western region of ghana to achieve its full potential 
wassa hbb operations compared to wassa hbb operating results ore mined t waste mined t ore and heap leach materials processed t grade processed g t recovery gold sales oz total cash cost oz royalties oz cash operating cost oz during  wassa mined and processed ore from the wassa pits near the wassa processing plants and from the benso and father brown pits at hwini butre 
mining operations were completed at benso in february and mining rates were subsequently increased at father brown and at wassa to compensate for the benso pit closure 
the father brown pit at hwini butre came online in late and its higher gold grades contributed to the increase in wassa plant feed grade during as compared to during  hwini butre provided approximately of the wassa plant ore tonnes at an average grade of approximately grams per tonne 
it is expected that father brown pit will provide approximately of the wassa plant ore feed in at an expected grade of grams per tonne 
as previously reported  the drilling program to test areas below the wassa pits was accelerated in the second half of by bringing in four additional drills to supplement the two drills that have been working at the wassa pits since early in see development projects section below for additional detail on this drilling program 
land acquisition for a new wassa tailings storage facility was completed during and construction of the new facility is now underway and is expected to be completed by mid the new tailings project  along with the drilling discussed above  are expected to be the major capital projects at wassa during arrangements are also underway to allow an expansion of the father brown pit at hwini butre over the next year and potential longer term expansion plans are being evaluated 
wassa sold  ounces of gold during  approximately lower than the  ounces sold in gold revenues totaled million in  up from million in wassa realized an average gold price of  per ounce during  up from  per ounce a year earlier 
wassa consolidated cash operating costs were comparable to  up less than from million from the increase in costs was related to an increase in the number of tonnes mined in since its inception  gswl has not paid income tax in ghana because ghana tax law allowed a deduction for the cost of past capital investments when gswl calculated its taxable income 
during  gswl capital allowance pool was largely depleted and in addition  tax law changes effective in placed new restrictions on use of capital allowances to offset taxable income 
as a result  wassa incurred taxable income in for the first time  and it is expected that gswl will pay approximately million of taxes to the government of ghana in related to gswl taxable income 
we also expect wassa will continue to generate taxable income going forward and more specifically  it is expected that gswl will make provisional tax payments on its income 
results of operations compared to consolidated results consolidated financial results included a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share which was improved over a net loss attributable to golden star of million or per share in while the number of ounces sold was down from s level and operating costs were higher  rising gold prices during yielded an increase in revenues that exceeded the impact of lower ounces and higher operating costs 
realized gold prices averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce in lower ore grades and less tonnes of ore processed at both bogoso and at wassa contributed to the loss  as did higher cash operating costs at both operations 
consolidated cash operating costs totaled million  up from million in the increase in cash operating costs reflects significant increases in prices of many of our key operating inputs including the prices paid for electric power  labor  cyanide  fuel  and other reagents used in processing plants 
higher cash operating costs also reflect an increase in waste mining activities in as compared to see bogoso operational discussion below for more details on cost increases 
depreciation charges in were down million from due to lower ounces sold at bogoso and at wassa  and due to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense per ounce from the increase in gold reserves at the end of gold hedging activities during resulted in a loss of million  up from a million loss in most of these losses were related to forward gold price contracts which lost value during the year as gold prices rose 
offsetting the gold derivative losses in was a million gain on fair value of the option feature in our convertible debentures 
the gain was in response to lower prices of our common shares which resulted in a lower value of the option feature 
in comparison  we recorded a million loss on the fair value of the conversion feature of our convertible debentures in in response to rising prices for our common shares 
see note of the attached financial statements for additional disclosure on fair value adjustments to our convertible debentures 
interest expense totaled million in  down marginally from million in  reflecting lower balances on our equipment financing loans during as loan balances were paid down 
corporate general and administrative costs totaled million in  up from million in most of the increase was related to one time corporate advisory and consulting fees totaling million  increases in non cash stock compensation expense  addition of a technical services group and higher option and personnel costs 
the consulting expense was related to an independent review performed at our mine sites to improve production processes and to lower operating costs 
this project was competed in the increase in income tax expense from reflects higher income in ghana at wassa 
bogoso prestea operations compared to bogoso prestea revenues totaled million in  up from million in the same period of while the number of ounces sold was lower than in  increases in realized gold prices during more than offset the impact of lower ounces 
bogoso realized gold price averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce a year earlier 
bogoso sold  ounces in  down from  ounces in decreases in tonnes processed and lower plant feed grade were the major factors contributing to the drop in ounces sold 
the decrease in grade as compared to reflects a change in ore source 
in  bogoso main feed source was the higher grade buesichem pit  but mining was completed at the buesichem pit in the third quarter of and subsequently bogoso moved its mining fleet to other pits at bogoso where ore grades have been lower than at buesichem 
the drop in tonnes processed  as compared to  reflects lower availability of ore in recent quarters as we pursued an accelerated waste stripping program at the chujah pit to allow a more steady supply of ore in subsequent periods 
bogoso cash operating costs totaled million during  up from million in the largest item contributing to bogoso increase in cash operating costs was a million tonne increase in waste tonnes mined which resulted in higher equipment rental costs  additional equipment maintenance costs and additional equipment operating costs 
increases in the price of electric power  fuel  cyanide and labor  as compared to  also contributed to higher operating costs as did higher maintenance expense than a year earlier 
more specifically  in late  the actual price we paid for mine truck tires was up from a year earlier 
similarly  the price we paid for electricity was higher  our fuel price was up  explosives were up and the cost of cyanide was up 
a decrease in the number of ounces sold and higher cash operating costs resulted in a  per ounce cash operating cost in  up from per ounce during bogoso royalty costs were higher than a year earlier due to higher revenues and an increase in the government of ghana royalty rate from in to in the drop in ounces sold contributed to lower units of production amortization expense  as did an increase in gold reserves at the end of cost analysis and cost control planning was a major focus at all operational sites during  and implementation of the new cost control programs are expected in early as part of the cost control efforts  we carried out an extensive mine planning exercise in late to determine the the optimum sequencing of the future bogoso prestea pits to provide a steady  long term flow of refractory and non refractory ores to the bogoso refractory and non refractory processing plants 
mining of non refractory ore was initiated at the pampe pit west of bogoso late in the third quarter of and the bogoso non refractory plant was brought on line in the first quarter of during  the prestea underground mine remained on a care and maintenance basis 
in late  our new technical services group began a pre feasibility study to evaluate economic potential of developing the prestea underground mine using mechanized mining methods 
wassa hbb operations compared to wassa sold  ounces during  down from  ounces in a drop in ore grade to g t from g t in was the major factor contributing to the reduction in ounces sold 
ore grades fell as mining proceeded into lower grade areas of the wassa and hbb ore bodies during higher realized gold prices offset the impact of lower ounces sold to yield revenues of million  up from million in wassa realized gold price averaged  per ounce during  up from  per ounce a year earlier 
cash operating costs totaled million in  up from million in increases in the price of electric power  fuel  cyanide  labor and maintenance contributed to higher operating costs 
see the bogoso discussion of costs  immediately above  for additional details on increases in the price of key items consumed in our operations 
the drop in ounces sold as compared to  coupled with higher cash operating costs  resulted in an increase in cash operating cost per ounce to  as compared to per ounce in mining operations were completed at benso in february the new father brown pit at hwini butre came on line in the fourth quarter of  replacing ore from other hwini butre pits that were closed upon completion of mining 
development projects progress was made at both bogoso prestea and at wassa hbb during to advance the development of several projects located on the existing bogoso prestea and wassa hbb leases 
each of these projects has the potential to increase gold output and or to lower costs per ounce 
at bogoso prestea  design  permitting and engineering proceeded on the dumasi  mampon  prestea south and prestea underground projects 
at wassa  development plans are underway for an expansion of the father brown pit at hwini butre to access additional higher grade ore and a longer term pit expansion is being evaluated 
drilling at wassa during identified several zones of gold mineralization below the existing pits  which contributed to an increase in proven and probable reserves  and additional drilling is planned in to better define the size and potential of this new resource 
a description of each of our development projects follows 
bogoso prestea projects dumasi dumasi is bogoso largest undeveloped ore body located approximately kilometers north of the bogoso processing plants  containing proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes grading gram per tonne for million ounces of recoverable gold 
this pit is expected to come on line in early  it is expected to be the major source of ore feed to the bogoso refractory processing plant for several years and is anticipated to send significant amounts of non refractory ore to the bogoso non refractory processing plant as well 
ore grades at dumasi are expected to be lower than at the chujah and bogoso north pits that have supplied most of the refractory ore at bogoso in recent years  but its stripping ratio should be lower 
dumasi development will require a resettlement of a community located near the planned pit  which we estimate will require spending of approximately million during to advance the development of the project  we signed a negotiated resettlement agreement with the community that is acceptable to all stakeholders 
construction of the new resettlement town site is expected to begin in and we currently expect to initiate mining at dumasi in mampon the mampon deposit is located approximately kilometers north east of the bogoso processing plants containing million tonnes of probable mineral reserves at an average gold grade of grams per tonne 
this project will employ open pit mining methods and the ore will be hauled by truck to the bogoso processing plants once mining commences 
the permitting process in now underway 
we plan to commence construction of a kilometer haul road to mampon in and to initiate mining by the initial ore will be non refractory but as mining proceeds deeper into the pit  refractory ore will be mined as well 
we expect to spend approximately million on mampon development activities during prestea undergound during the first quarter of  a preliminary economic assessment pea study was finalized for the west reef section of the prestea underground property south of bogoso 
the pea targets a mechanized mine development plan which would deliver approximately  tonnes per day at an average diluted mined grade of approximately grams per tonne  producing approximately  ounces of gold per year at full production 
economic analysis from the pea indicates a capital cost of approximately million for completion of the refurbishment of the central shaft and existing haulage drives to the west reef area  upgrading of pumps  compressors and ventilation  development of a decline and raise bored shaft to level and initial stope development 
test work indicates that the mineralization is non refractory with a significant portion of the gold expected to be recovered from the gravity circuit at the bogoso non refractory processing plant for total gold production of approximately  ounces over the life of the project 
the pea assumes access to the west reef via a decline from surface  with simultaneous decline development from level meters below surface 
the decline would be used for passage of people  materials and equipment into the west reef area 
the pea incorporates an ore hoisting shaft that would be raise bored from west reef to surface 
the pea was filed on sedar in canada and was furnished to the us securities and exchange commission in early may the mineral resources reported in the pea are compliant with canada national instrument the board of directors has authorized management to proceed with a west reef feasibility study  which is expected to be completed in the second quarter of the environmental permitting will proceed in parallel with the feasibility study 
this project has been registered with the ghana environmental protection agency  and the consultant to complete the environmental impact assessment work has been selected 
in the second quarter of  the board of directors approved million for additional drilling on the west reef and million for mining equipment  permitting and shaft rehabilitation during the second half of geo technical drilling of the reef commenced in august and is continuing into we expect to spend million on underground development and capital equipment during permitting for the prestea underground is underway 
we submitted an environmental scoping report for the project and have been advised to proceed with the environmental impact assessment 
the environmental baseline collection is underway and the environmental impact statement will be completed for submission to the epa for the approval 
in the interim  environmental and mining permits have been received which allows pre development activities to proceed 
these activities include refurbishment and up grading of underground equipment and facilities to improve the structural integrity of the shafts  upgrading of the mine ventilation system  recommissioning of ore and waste handling infrastructure in preparation for west reef mining and clean up of ore from old development and stoping areas that have short term production potential 
bogoso tailings recovery project construction of the bogoso hydraulic tailings recovery system  designed to feed tailings from a decommissioned bogoso tailings storage facility directly into the bogoso non refractory processing plant  is now complete and environmental permits needed for start up have been received 
we plan to initiate a test run of this new operation in early and expect to feed the old tailings to the non refractory plant as a supplemental feed to the primary non refractory ore sources 
while the grade of the tailings material is lower than that of the ores typically treated in the bogoso non refractory plant in the past  operating costs are expected to be low since reclaimed tailings can be fed directly into the existing cil circuit after a minimal amount of processing through the ball mill 
prestea south properties the prestea south project is located on the ashanti trend  southwest of the town of prestea and approximately kilometers southwest of the bogoso processing plants 
gold mineralization is associated with the same ashanti trend fault structure that continues to the north through our bogoso and prestea properties 
while various sections of the mineral resources at prestea south were mined by prior owners using underground methods  the near surface non refractory mineral resources have not been extensively mined  and there are also refractory mineral resources accessible by open pit mining 
our past exploration efforts have identified several deposits along this trend which can be mined by surface mining methods 
we have received mining permits for this area and have applied for environmental permits 
we expect to initiate development at prestea south  including its kilometer haul road extension  once the environmental permits are received 
the prestea south non refractory ore will be transported to bogoso and processed through the bogoso non refractory plant 
the prestea south refractory ore will be processed through the bogoso refractory plant 
we plan to spend approximately million on development activities during mining is expeted to begin here in early as of december   the prestea south properties had total proven and probable mineral reserves of million tonnes grading grams per tonne containing approximately million ounces 
wassa hbb wassa drilling program as previously reported  the drilling program testing areas below the wassa pits was accelerated in the third and fourth quarters of by bringing in three additional drills to supplement the two drills that have been working at the wassa pits since early in production from the five drills totaled  meters during a sixth drill was added near the end of the drilling was designed to delineate the extent and geologic controls of the higher grade zones of mineralization 
drilling continues to intercept zones of gold mineralized material at various depths below the existing wassa pits and the drill data is being analyzed to better understand the geology and its impact on the mineralization 
see operating properties section above for a description of the geology associated with this drilling program 
drilling results up to the end of august were used to update an interim resource model estimate and this was the basis for the expanded december  resource and reserve estimates contained in this document 
most of the  ounce increase in proven and probable reserves at wassa during was related directly to the new drilling below the wassa pits  and the grade of the new reserves below the existing wassa pits is higher than the grades mined at wassa in recent years 
we expect to continue drilling beneath the wassa pits throughout and plan to complete an updated resource model in the second half of which will incorporate drilling completed since august we expect that the additional drilling completed after august and the additional planned drilling in  will result in a further increase in wassa resources 
exploration projects exploration expense and capitalized drilling expenditures totaled approximately million during the main focus of exploration in was the drill testing of the wassa resource expansion beneath the existing wassa pits 
the wassa program focused on step out drilling which tested the extent of the previously intersected mineralization along strike on meter drill fences and down and up dip extensions of the mineralization on to meter spacing 
our other exploration efforts in included drilling the father brown and the adoikrom underground targets beneath the existing open pits  drilling at pretsea and esuaso at hbb and drilling the opon east geophysical target 
exploration efforts were also restarted on the west reef at the prestea underground where we purchased and commissioned our own underground drill rig in the second half of the underground drilling was focused on infilling the existing drilling to collect information for geotechnical and metallurgical studies for the ongoing feasibility study 
in niger our properties are being earned into by middle island resources  which have taken over the joint venture from ami resources 
exploration activity was limited to deep auger drilling on our amelika property in cote d ivoire during  however all three of our licenses were renewed for two years and we have also submitted seven additional applications which are pending approval 
the sonfon property in sierra leone remains in a state of limbo as we continue our efforts to re instate the exploration license 
in south america  exploration efforts concentrated on the iriri joint venture in northern mato grosso state in brazil  where we have the ability to earn a ownership position in a  square kilometer land package 
the iriri joint venture is a green fields project encompassing regional  wide spaced soil and stream sediment sampling 
during  sampling programs included both stream sediment and soil geochemistry sampling 
in suriname  we completed the sale of our remaining interest in the saramacca project in suriname to newmont mining corporation for approximately million and the exploration license was transferred to newmont in december exploration plans we have budgeted approximately million for exploration activities in most of which will be concentrated on continue wassa pit expansion drilling  resource conversion and geotechnical drilling at the west reef section of the prestea underground  mampon resource conversion and infill drilling and prestea south non refractory ore confirmation drilling 
the majority of s exploration expenditures will be at wassa where we plan to spend an additional million on expansion drilling programs 
the drilling programs for wassa main will continue to target the higher grade zones beneath the b shoot  starter pit and pit to further delineate the continuity of these zones 
infill holes will be planned based on results  infilling where additional information is needed to build better confidence in mineralization continuity and geometry or higher grades 
prestea underground exploration during will concentrate on completing the remaining geotechnical metallurgical sample drilling on level and a single drill rig will then be used to define and delineate additional resources along the west reef projected strike and dip 
the surface exploration drilling at bogoso prestea will target non refractory material for the non refractory plant  and will include mampon and aboronye infill and resource conversion  buesichem east non refractory drill off and prestea south non refractory confirmation programs 
the exploration activities at hbb will be limited to further drilling of the manso and esuaso targets 
west african exploration activities outside of ghana will be limited in to allow focus on the expansion of our current assets in ghana 
limited exploration in cote d ivoire will involve drill testing of the amelika deep auger anomalies either by golden star or by a joint venture partner 
brazil exploration for will be limited to project evaluation and monitoring of our joint venture properties with kinross in minas gerais state 
we are awaiting final results for the iriri joint venture and depending on these results  will decide whether to pull out of the joint venture or follow up on any anomalies should they materialize 
in suriname  we will assist newmont to complete the transfer of the saramacca properties and then will close the paramaribo office 
liquidity and capital resources we held million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   down from million at the end of the major factor contributing to the reduction was the redemption of outstanding debt during during we redeemed million of our convertible debentures using million of cash and the issuance of million of new convertible debentures 
before working capital changes  our operations provided million of operating cash flow  up from million in the increase was related primarily to increases in revenues from more ounces produced and sold at higher gold prices in lower reclamation spending also contributed to the improvement in operating cash flow 
we substantially completed back filling the plant north pit at bogoso in at a cost of million  which accounted for most of reclamation spending 
as a result  reclamation spending dropped from million in to million in working capital changes during used a net million as compared to million in increases in ore stockpile inventories contributed million to the increase in including million to increase bogoso prestea ore stockpile inventories 
the inventory increase included filling the non refractory plant upon start up as well as larger non refractory stockpiles to support operations at the non refractory plant 
refractory ore stockpiles were increased at bogoso to provide a contingency for the wet seasons and to allow for better ore blending 
wassa also added to its ore stockpiles during to create a stand by surge pile to be available during wet weather 
the increase in deposits in reflects down payments on capital equipment purchases and payments for long lead time purchases 
in summary  net cash provided by operating activities was million in as compared to million in  an increase of million 
a net of million was used in investing activities during  including for million on mining property development drilling and mine development projects and million for the acquisition of new equipment and facilities at the mine sites 
major capital spending items at bogoso during included million for new mobile mining equipment  million for improvements to the plants  million for tailings facilities  million for on going construction of a water treatment plant  million for development drilling  million for pre stripping at pampe  million for prestea underground upgrades  million for mine development and other items of million 
during  wassa major capital projects included million of development drilling  mostly at the wassa pits  million for resettlement of a community to allow development of a new tailings disposal facility  million for new mobile equipment  million for an upgrade to the current tailings storage facility and development of a new tailings storage facility now underway  million in plant upgrades  million of other capital equipment and million on other projects 
the sale of our burkina faso assets generated million of cash in february  and an additional million of cash was realized during the balance of the year upon sale of a portion of the shares received as payment for the sale of the burkina faso properties 
we also received million of cash in december from the sale of an exploration project in suriname 
in summary total cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million used in  a decrease of million 
scheduled debt repayments on our equipment financing facility and capital leases used million of cash in  and new borrowings on our equipment financing facility provided million of cash 
the new borrowings covered the purchase of five new haul trucks  a loader and two new drills 
an additional million was used to redeem our outstanding convertible debentures during this resulted in million being used in financing activities in compared to million million being used in  an increase of million 
in summary  operating cash flow before working capital changes provided million of cash in of which million was used for working capital  million was used for capital investing purposes  a net million was used to pay down debt  million was received on sale of assets  and million was used for other purposes resulting in a net cash reduction of million for the year 
during  all of our cash was held as cash or was invested in funds that held only us treasury notes and bonds 
since its inception  gswl has not paid income tax in ghana because ghana tax law allowed a deduction for the cost of past capital investments when gswl calculated its taxable income 
during  gswl capital allowance pool was largely depleted and in addition tax law changes effective in placed new restrictions on use of capital allowances to offset taxable income 
as a result  wassa incurred taxable income in for the first time and it is expected that gswl will pay approximately million of taxes to the government of ghana in related to gswl taxable income 
we expect wassa will continue to generate taxable income going forward and more specifically  it is expected that gswl will make provisional tax payments on its income 
liquidity outlook based on current expectations  capital needs for and will be higher than in recent years as we pursue a series of organic growth projects see development project section above at our existing properties that are expected to increase gold output and lower future costs per ounce 
also during  we will do major pit wall push backs at the chujah and bogoso north pits which will raise bogoso prestea operating cost in while these push backs will raise stripping rates in  it will provide a more steady supply of refractory ore to bogoso refractory plant in subsequent years beginning in in addition to the new mine development project  bogoso prestea is evaluating a major plant upgrade at bogoso refractory plant designed to increase throughput and improve recoveries and wassa will proceed with construction of a new tailings disposal facility during more specifically the expected capital costs of our mines are as follows expected capital spending millions bogoso prestea dumasi development mampon and prestea south development prestea underground water treatment plant mining equipment plant upgrades other sub total wassa hbb tailings storage facility wassa drilling program hbb development costs wassa plant upgrades other sub total total capital spending as of december   we had million of outstanding loans on our million equipment financing facility leaving a borrowing capacity of million 
our revolving credit facility expired on april   as scheduled in the terms of the original loan agreement 
we expect that our capital projects will be funded by operating cash flow  the equipment financing facility and cash on hand at december  as well additional financing 
if these cash sources are not sufficient  certain capital projects could be delayed  alternatively we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financing and there is no assurance that such financing will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
under our current shelf registration statement  we may issue  from time to time  any combination of common shares  preferred shares  warrants  rights or convertible debt securities in one or more offerings 
we have not issued any securities under this registration statement to date and have no immediate plans to do so  however  we may issue additional debt or equity securities at any time 
looking ahead our main objectives for the next twelve months include complete the prestea underground feasibility study  initiation of underground operations at the prestea underground mine  continue exploration drilling at the wassa mining lease to follow up on the drilling results and an update of reserves  complete construction of the new tailings storage facility at wassa  permitting of dumasi pit  approval of the dumasi resettlement action plan and commencement of construction of the dumasi resettlement town site  permitting and planning of the mampon pit  permitting and planning of the prestea south pits  and achieve further reductions in operating costs throughout the organization 
we are estimating bogoso prestea production of  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of  to  per ounce 
we expect wassa to produce approximately  to  ounces during at an average cash operating cost of to  per ounce  with combined production of approximately  to  ounces at an average cash operating cost of  to  per ounce 
election to become foreign private issuer we currently file  as a domestic issuer  periodic reports with the sec as required under the exchange act of  as amended 
we intend to streamline our administrative functions and become a foreign private issuer under the us securities laws by relocating our headquarters from the us to canada prior to june  the measurement date 
assuming we qualify as a foreign private issuer as of the measurement date  we plan to begin reporting as a foreign private issuer in the us for all periodic reports filed after june  we currently file our financial statements with both us and canadian securities regulators in accordance with us gaap  as permitted under current regulations 
we are reviewing the transition from us gaap to international financial reporting standards ifrs as issued by the international accounting standards board iasb and for our financial statement reporting requirements following our change in status to a foreign private issuer 
we are currently developing our ifrs change over plan 
towards this end we have retained qualified professional personnel to oversee and affect the conversion process 
it is expected that the plan will take into consideration  among other things changes in financial statement preparation and note disclosures  information technology and data system requirements  disclosure controls and procedures  including investor relations and external communication plans related to the conversion to ifrs  maintenance of effective internal controls through ifrs transition and design and implementation of new ifrs control measures  financial reporting expertise requirements  including training of personnel  and impacts on other business activities that may be influenced by ifrs measures  such as performance measures and debt covenants 
as more fully disclosed in the risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k  numerous factors could cause our estimates and expectations to be wrong or could lead to changes in our plans 
under any of these circumstances  the estimates described above could change materially 
environmental laws and regulations see item description of properties mining in ghana for a description of environmental laws and regulations and for a discussion of our social and economic development activities in ghana 
related party transactions we obtained legal services from a legal firm to which one of our board members is of counsel 
the total value of all services purchased from this law firm during and was million and million  respectively 
our board member did not personally perform any legal services for us during the period nor did he benefit directly or indirectly from payments for the services performed by the firm 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that can affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
accounting policies relating to asset impairments  depreciation and amortization of mining property and plant and equipment  stock based compensation  tax assets  determination of fair values of financial instruments and site reclamation closure accruals are subject to estimates and assumptions regarding reserves  gold recoveries  future gold prices  future operating and reclamation costs and future mining activities 
decisions to write off  or not to write off  all or a portion of the purchase costs of exploration properties and development costs of development properties are based on our judgment as to the actual value of such properties and are therefore subjective in most cases 
certain exploration and development properties have been found to be impaired in the past and were written off in prior years 
we continue to retain title to certain exploration properties after impairment write offs as future events and discoveries may ultimately prove that they have value 
listed below are the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements based on the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
ore stockpiles stockpiles represent coarse ore that has been extracted from the mine and is available for further processing 
stockpiles are measured by physical surveys or by estimating the number of tonnes of ore added and removed from the stockpile during a period 
the number of recoverable ounces of gold in stockpiles is based on assay data and the gold recovery rate expected when the ore is processed 
stockpile values include mining and mine maintenance costs incurred in bringing the ore to the stockpile  and also a share of direct overhead and applicable depreciation  depletion and amortization relating to mining operations 
costs are added to a stockpile based on current mining costs and are removed at the average cost per tonne of the total stockpile 
stockpiles are reduced as material is removed and fed to the processing plant 
a adjustment to the volume of the stockpiles  based on recent stockpile tonnages  would change the carrying value of the stockpile inventory by approximately million 
impairment charges we periodically review and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable from continued operation of the asset 
an asset impairment is considered to exist if the sum of all estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the carrying value of the long lived asset 
the determination of expected future cash flows requires numerous estimates about the future  including gold prices  operating costs  production levels  gold recovery rates  ore reserves  amounts of recoverable gold and capital expenditures 
we model our future cash flows using our life of mine plan  we consider various gold price scenarios including current gold prices and consensus gold price forecasts 
we also consider various cost and gold recovery rate assumptions  including current and expected future costs structures and recovery rates 
based on our assessment at december   we don t believe that our long lived assets are impaired 
amortization capital expenditures for mining properties  mine development and certain property plant and equipment items  are amortized using a units of production method over proven and probable mineral reserve ounces of gold 
capital expenditures that benefit an entire mining property  such as the cost of building an administrative facility  are amortized over all ounces contained on the property 
capital expenditures that benefit only a specific asset such as the pre production stripping costs of a pit  are amortized over only the ounces located in the associated pit 
reserve estimates  which serve as the denominator in units of production amortization calculations  involve the exercise of subjective judgment and are based on numerous assumptions about future operating costs  future gold prices  continuity of mineralization  future gold recovery rates  spatial configuration of gold deposits  and other factors that may prove to be incorrect 
a change in estimated total reserves at wassa and at bogoso prestea could result in an approximately million change in annual amortization expense 
tax assets recognition of deferred tax assets requires an analysis of future taxable income expectations to evaluate the probability of sufficient future taxable income to utilize the accrued tax benefits 
determination of expected future taxable income requires numerous estimates of future variables including but not limited to gold prices  operating costs  gold recovery  ore reserves  gold production  ore grades  administrative costs  tax rates  and potential changes in tax laws 
asset retirement obligation and reclamation expenditures accounting for future reclamation obligations requires management to make estimates at each mine site of future reclamation and closure costs 
in many cases  a majority of such costs are incurred at the end of a mine life which can be several years in the future 
such estimates are subject to changes in mining plans  reclamation requirements  inflation rates and technology 
as a result  future reclamation and closure costs are difficult to estimate 
our estimates of future reclamation and closing costs are reviewed frequently and are adjusted as needed to reflect new information about the timing and expected future costs of our environmental disturbances 
based upon our current situation  we estimate that a increase in total future reclamation and closure cash costs would result in an approximately million increase in our asset retirement obligations 
accounting developments presentation of comprehensive income in june  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income asu  to require an entity to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
asu eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of equity 
asu was effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal and was applied retrospectively 
our presentation of comprehensive income complies with this new guidance 
amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and international financial reporting standards topic fair value measurement asu  to provide a consistent definition of fair value and ensure that the fair value measurement and disclosure requirements are similar between us gaap and international financial reporting standards 
asu changes certain fair value measurement principles and enhances the disclosure requirements particularly for level fair value measurements 
asu was effective for us in and was applied prospectively 
the fair value measurement principles used before the adoption of this standard is consistent with the standard and the disclosures made in the financial statements comply with this new guidance

the presentation shown above assumes payment is made in cash and also assumes no conversions of the debt to common shares by the holders prior to the maturity date 
asset retirement obligations include estimates about future reclamation costs  mining schedules  timing of the performance of reclamation work and the quantity of ore reserves  an analysis of which determines the ultimate closure date and impacts the discounted amounts of future asset retirement liabilities 
the discounted value of these projected cash flows is recorded as asset retirement obligations on the balance sheet at million as of december  the amounts shown above are undiscounted to show full expected cash requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk includes  but is not limited to  the following risks changes in interest rates on our debt  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and commodity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
our convertible debentures and the outstanding loans under our equipment financing facility bear interest at a fixed rate and are not subject to changes in interest payments 
we therefore have not entered into any agreements to hedge against unfavorable changes in interest rates  but may in the future actively manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currency risk is risk that the fair value of future cash flows will fluctuate because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  the value of cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies can fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates 
since our revenues are denominated in us dollars and our operating units transact much of their business in us dollars  we are typically not subject to significant impacts from currency fluctuations 
even thus  certain purchases of labor  operating supplies and capital assets are denominated in ghana cedis  euros  british pounds  australian dollars and south african rand 
to accommodate these purchases  we maintain operating cash accounts in non us dollar currencies and appreciation of these non us dollar currencies against the us dollar results in a foreign currency gain and a decrease in non us dollar currencies results in a loss 
in the past  we have entered into forward purchase contracts for south african rand  euros and other currencies to hedge expected purchase costs of capital assets 
during and  we had no currency related derivatives 
at december   and december   we held million and million  respectively  of foreign currency 
commodity price risk gold is our primary product and  as a result  changes in the price of gold can significantly affect our results of operations and cash flows 
based on our expected gold production in  a per ounce change in gold price would result in approximately a million and million change in our sales revenues and operating cash flows  respectively 
to reduce gold price volatility  we have at various times entered into gold price derivatives 
during  we did not hold any gold price derivatives and thus  there were no financial instruments subject to gold price risk at those dates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that we will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset 
we manage the liquidity risk inherent in these financial obligations by preparing quarterly forecasts and annual long term budgets which forecast cash needs and expected cash availability to meet future obligations 
typically these obligations are met by cash flows from operations and from cash on hand 
scheduling of capital spending and acquisitions of financial resources may also be employed  as needed and as available  to meet the cash demands of our obligations 
our ability to repay or refinance our future obligations depends on a number of factors  some of which may be beyond our control 
factors that influence our ability to meet these obligations include general global economic conditions  credit and capital market conditions  results of operations and the price of gold 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation 
our credit risk is primarily associated with liquid financial assets and derivatives 
we limit exposure to credit risk on liquid financial assets by holding our cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and deposits at highly rated financial institutions 
during  all of our excess cash was invested in funds that hold only us treasury bills 
risks associated with gold trade receivables is considered minimal as we sell gold to a credit worthy buyer who settles promptly within two days of receipt of gold bullion
