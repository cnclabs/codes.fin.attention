item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read this discussion together with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information included in this annual report 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under part i  item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a global provider of high quality  technologically advanced flexible printed circuits and value added component assembly solutions to the electronics industry 
we believe that we are one of a limited number of manufacturers that provide a seamless  integrated flexible printed circuit and assembly solution from design and application engineering and prototyping through high volume fabrication  component assembly and testing 
we target our solutions within the electronics market and  in particular  our solutions enable our customers to achieve a desired size  shape  weight or functionality of the device 
current examples of applications for our products include mobile phones  smartphones  tablets  personal computers  consumer products  portable bar code scanners  computer data storage and medical devices 
we provide our solutions to original equipment manufacturers oems such as apple  inc  and to electronic manufacturing services ems providers such as foxconn electronics  inc  protek shanghai limited and flextronics international ltd 
our business model  and the way we approach the markets which we serve  is based on value added engineering and providing technology solutions to our customers facilitating the miniaturization of portable electronics 
we currently rely on a core mobility end market for nearly all of our revenue 
we believe this dynamic market offers fewer  but larger  opportunities than other electronic markets do  and changes in market leadership can occur with little to no warning 
through early supplier involvement with customers  we look to assist in the development of new designs and processes for the manufacturing of their products and  through value added component assembly of components on flex  seek to provide a higher level of product within their supply chain structure 
this approach is relatively unique and may or may not always fit with the operating practices of all oems 
our ability to add to our customer base may have a direct impact on the relative percentage of each customer s revenue to total revenues during any reporting period 
we typically have numerous programs in production at any particular time  the life cycle for which is typically around one year 
the programs prices are subject to intense negotiation and are determined on a program by program basis  dependent on a wide variety of factors  including without limitation  expected volumes  assumed yields  material costs  actual yields  and the amount of third party components within the program 
our profitability is dependent upon how we perform against our targets and the assumptions on which we base our prices for each particular program 
our volumes  margins and yields also vary from program to program and  given various factors and assumptions on which we base our prices  are not necessarily indicative of our profitability 
in fact  some lower priced programs have higher margins while other higher priced programs have lower margins 
given that the programs in production vary from period to period and the pricing and margins between programs vary widely  volumes are not necessarily indicative of our performance 
for example  we could experience an increase in volumes for a particular program during a particular period  but depending on that program s margins and yields and the other programs in production during that period  those higher volumes may or may not result in an increase in overall profitability 
from our inception in until  we were engaged primarily in the manufacturing of flexible printed circuits for military and aerospace applications 
in early  we began to develop the concept of attaching components on flexible printed circuits for motorola 
through these early efforts  we developed the concept of the value added approach with respect to integrating our design engineering expertise with our component assembly capabilities 
this strategy has enabled us to capitalize on two trends over the course of the s  the outsourcing by oems of their manufacturing needs and the shift of manufacturing facilities outside of the united states 
in  we formed a wholly owned chinese subsidiary to better serve customers that have production facilities in asia and provide a cost effective  high volume production platform for the manufacture of our 
table of contents products 
in fiscal  we formed a second wholly owned subsidiary in china to further expand our flexible printed circuit manufacturing and assembly capacity  and we merged these two subsidiaries into one in fiscal in addition  we formed another wholly owned subsidiary in chengdu  china  and in fiscal  completed construction on our third and fourth manufacturing facilities in china as part of our continued capacity expansion initiative 
our chinese subsidiaries provide a complete range of capabilities and services to support our global customer base  including design engineering and high volume production of single sided  double sided and multi layer flexible printed circuits and component assemblies 
net sales we design and manufacture our products to customer specifications 
throughout fiscal  we engaged the services of certain non exclusive sales representatives located throughout north america and asia to provide customer contacts and market our products directly to our global customer base 
the varieties of products our customers manufacture are referred to as programs 
the majority of our sales are made to customers outside of the united states  and therefore sales volumes may be impacted by customer program and product mix changes as well as delivery schedule changes imposed on us by our customers 
all sales from our irvine  california executive office  singapore regional office and our united kingdom facility are denominated in us dollars 
all sales from our china facilities are denominated in us dollars for sales outside china or rmb for sales made in china 
cost of sales cost of sales consisted of four major categories material  overhead  labor and purchased process services 
material cost relates primarily to the purchase of copper foil  gold  polyimide substrates and electronic components 
overhead costs included all materials and facility costs associated with manufacturing support  processing supplies and expenses  support personnel costs  stock based compensation expense related to such personnel  utilities  amortization of facilities and equipment and other related costs 
labor cost included the cost of personnel related to the manufacture of the completed product 
purchased process services related to the subcontracting of specific manufacturing processes to outside contractors 
cost of sales may be impacted by timing of wage increases at our manufacturing facilities  capacity utilization  manufacturing yields  product mix and production efficiencies 
also  we may be subject to increased costs as a result of changing material prices because we do not have long term fixed supply agreements  inflation may occur in countries in which we produce and market wage rate increases may also occur in these countries 
research and development research and development costs are incurred in the development of new products and processes  including significant improvements and refinements to existing products and processes and are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense included commissions paid to sales representatives  personnel related and travel costs associated with sales and marketing  program management  corporate development and engineering support groups  sales support  trade shows  freight out  costs to warehouse and manage hub inventories positioned near our customers  market studies and promotional and marketing brochures 
general and administrative general and administrative expense primarily included personnel related and travel costs associated with finance accounting  tax  internal audit  legal  human resources  information services and executive personnel along with other expenses related to external accounting  legal and professional expenses  business insurance  management information systems  investor relations  board of directors and other corporate office expenses 

table of contents impairment and restructuring asset impairment is the difference between the fair market value  based on the estimated future cash flows of the underlying assets  and the carrying value  or net book value  of the assets 
impairment occurs when the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the underlying assets 
restructuring expense represents severance  relocation  and other costs and recoveries related to the closure or disposal of a business unit or location 
interest income interest income consisted primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest expense interest expense consisted of expense incurred on unused line fees on our revolving facilities and interest related to our deferred financing costs 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  consisted primarily of the gain or loss on foreign currency exchange and the gain or loss on derivative financial instruments 
provision for income taxes we record a provision for income taxes based on the statutory rates applicable in the countries in which we do business  subject to any tax holiday periods granted by the respective governmental authorities 
we account for income taxes under the financial accounting standards board fasb authoritative guidance which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to inventories  income taxes  accounts receivable allowance and warranty 
we base our estimates on historical experience  performance metrics and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  inventories and income taxes 
refer to note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a complete list of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenues  which we refer to as net sales  are generated from the sale of flexible printed circuit boards and assemblies  which are sold to oems  subcontractors and ems providers to be included in other electronic products 
an ems provider may or may not be an oem subcontractor 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer that includes a fixed or determinable sales price  when title and risk of loss transfers  when delivery of the 
table of contents product has occurred in accordance with the terms of the sale and collectability of the related account receivable is reasonably assured 
our remaining obligation to customers after delivery is limited to our warranty obligations on our product 
we report sales net of an accounts receivable allowance  refunds and credits  which we estimate based on historical experience 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory and write down our inventory based on historical usage and our estimate of expected and future product demand 
actual results may differ from our judgments  and additional write downs may be required 
income taxes 
we determine if our deferred tax assets and liabilities are realizable on an ongoing basis by assessing our need for a valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  as necessary 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we have considered taxable income in prior carry back years  expected future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets for which we previously provided a valuation allowance  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance 
conversely  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase the valuation allowance would be charged to our results of operations in the period such conclusion was reached 
we operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although we believe that adequate consideration has been made for such issues  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of such issues could be significantly different than originally estimated

currently  our long lived assets at our operating and production facilities are classified as held for use within mflex s asset grouping and are evaluated for impairment using the held for use model 
if the forecasted undiscounted cash flows significantly decline in the future  we may be required to record long lived asset impairment charges 
in addition  if we decide to close certain operating or production facilities in the future while meeting the held for sale classification criteria  impairment charges may be required for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the long lived assets to be disposed of 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september   from million in the fiscal year ended september   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily a result of decreased interest rates on our cash held by foreign institutions

income taxes 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal years ended september  and was and  respectively 
the change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets related to one of our entities in fiscal as well as our income and tax expense distribution by region 
guidance net sales 
for our first quarter of fiscal  we expect net sales to be between and million based on the anticipated product mix  net sales volume and production build plans 
cost of sales and gross profit 
for our first quarter of fiscal  we expect gross margin to be break even based on the anticipated product mix  net sales volume and production build plans 
operating expenses 
we expect operating expenses to be approximately between and million during our first fiscal quarter of income taxes 
we expect the effective tax rate  on average  to be in the low twenties in the long term 
capital expenditures 
for our first quarter of fiscal  we are anticipating capital expenditures to be less than million 
for the foreseeable future  we intend to limit our capital expenditures to normal equipment replacement and investments in automation 
these projections are subject to substantial uncertainty

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and our ability to borrow under our various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance working capital  facility expansions  stock repurchases and other capital expenditures 
we anticipate these uses will continue to be our principal uses of cash in the future 
global financial and credit markets have been volatile in recent years  and future adverse conditions of these markets could negatively affect our ability to secure funds or raise capital at a reasonable cost  if needed 
we believe that funds generated from our operations and available from our borrowing facilities will be sufficient to fund current business operations as well as anticipated growth over at least the next fiscal year  without the need to repatriate earnings 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately   and  for the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively

due to the timing of new program ramps  a substantial portion of our fourth fiscal quarter revenues were recognized late in the quarter  which resulted in a large accounts receivable balance not due until the first fiscal quarter of our net inventory balance increased to million as of september  versus million as of september  the increase was primarily the result of customer requests to stock finished goods inventory at our hub locations that are close in proximity to electronic manufacturing services ems facilities where the end product handset or tablet is assembled in preparation for our increased volume during our first fiscal quarter of our accounts payable balance increased to million as of september  from million as of september   an increase of 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily the result of the timing of inventory purchases and more favorable vendor payment terms 
purchases increased towards the end of our fourth fiscal quarter of to support increased production volumes and the corresponding payables are not due until the latter half of the first quarter of fiscal depreciation and amortization expense was million for the fiscal year ended september   versus million for the comparable period of the prior year  an increase of million 
this was primarily due to an increased fixed asset base in manufacturing operations in china

we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the liability on uncertain tax positions has not been included in the contractual obligations table 
recent accounting pronouncements refer to note basis of presentation and significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in liquidity  market rates and foreign exchange rates 
at september   no amounts were outstanding under our loan agreements with bank of china co  ltd  jpmorgan chase bank  na  agricultural bank of china or china construction bank 
the amounts outstanding under these loan agreements at any time may fluctuate and we may  from time to time  be subject to refinancing risk 
we do not believe that a change of basis points in the interest rate would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition based on our current borrowing level 
foreign currency risk we derive a substantial portion of our sales outside of the us approximately million  or  of total shipments to these foreign manufacturers during fiscal were made in us dollars with the remaining balance of our net sales denominated in rmb 
we currently have a significant portion of our expenses  more specifically cost of sales  denominated in rmb  whereby a significant appreciation or depreciation in the rmb could materially affect our reported expenses in us dollars 
the exchange rate for the rmb to the us dollar has been an average of rmb per us dollar for fiscal to date  we attempt to manage our working capital in a manner to minimize foreign currency exposure and from time to time  we may engage in currency hedging activities through use of forward contracts  but such activities may not be able to limit the risks of currency fluctuations and we continue to be vulnerable to appreciation or depreciation of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
the changes in fair value of the outstanding forward contracts are recognized in earnings during the period of change as other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
we recognized a gain of million during the fiscal year ended september  related to these forward contracts 
liquidity risk we believe our anticipated cash flows from operations are sufficient to fund our operations  including capital expenditure requirements  through at least the next fiscal year 
if there was a need for additional cash to fund our operations  we would access our global credit lines
