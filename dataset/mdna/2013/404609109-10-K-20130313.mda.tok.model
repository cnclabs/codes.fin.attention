in the following discussion  hackett represents our total company 
the hackett group encompasses our benchmarking  business transformation and executive advisory groups  and includes epm technologies 
erp solutions encompasses our erp technology groups  which include sap and oracle 
the acquisition of archstone in late brought a strong epm transformation group to hackett 
this allowed us to combine the acquired transformation skills with our existing epm technology group  which has been one of the hackett group s growth drivers 
the transformation and technology groups both adopted the hackett group brand in  and in moved to a combined incentive plan 
therefore  the revenue of the epm technology group is reflected in the hackett group service line to best reflect this integration of brand and go to market focus in the company report 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies 
these policies require management to exercise judgment on issues that are often difficult  subjective and complex due to the necessity of estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition our revenue is principally derived from fees for services generated on a project by project basis 
revenue for services rendered is recognized on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee or capped fee basis 
revenue for time and materials contracts is recognized based on the number of hours worked by our consultants at an agreed upon rate per hour and is recognized in the period in which services are performed 
revenue related to fixed fee or capped fee contracts is recognized on the proportional performance method of accounting based on the ratio of labor hours incurred to estimated total labor hours 
this percentage is multiplied by the contracted dollar amount of the project to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized in an accounting period 
the contracted dollar amount used in this calculation excludes the amount the client pays us for reimbursable expenses 
there are situations where the number of hours to complete projects may exceed our original estimate  as a result of an increase in project scope  unforeseen events that arise  or the inability of the client or the delivery team to fulfill their responsibilities 
on an on going basis  our project delivery  office of risk management and finance personnel review hours incurred and estimated total labor hours to complete projects 
any revisions in these estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
if our estimates indicate that a contract loss will occur  a loss provision will be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct costs of the contract exceed the estimated total revenue that will be generated by the contract 
these costs are included in total cost of service 
revenue from advisory services is recognized ratably over the life of the client agreements 
revenue for contracts with multiple elements is allocated based on the selling price of the elements 
additionally  we earn revenue from the resale of software licenses and maintenance contracts 
revenue for the resale of software and software licenses is recognized upon contract execution and customer receipt of software 
revenue from maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the agreements 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for services performed that have not been invoiced 
if we do not accurately estimate the scope of the work to be performed  or we do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time  or we do not meet our clients expectations under the contracts  then future consulting margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
sales tax collected from customers and remitted to the applicable taxing authorities is accounted for on a net basis  with no impact on revenue 
revenue before reimbursements excludes reimbursable expenses charged to clients 
reimbursements  which include travel and out of pocket expenses  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of service 
the agreements entered into in connection with a project  whether time and materials  or fixed fee or capped fee based  typically allow our clients to terminate early due to breach or for convenience with days notice 
in the event of termination  the client is contractually required to pay for all time  materials and expenses incurred by us through the effective date of the termination 
in addition  from time to time we enter into agreements with our clients that limit our right to enter into business relationships with specific competitors of that client for a specific time period 
these provisions typically prohibit us from performing a defined range of services which we might otherwise be willing to perform for potential clients 
these provisions are generally limited to six to twelve months and usually apply only to specific employees or the specific project team 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients not making required payments 
periodically  we review accounts receivable to assess our estimates of collectability 
management critically reviews accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  past due accounts  client credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets excluding goodwill and other intangible assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if there has been an impairment 
the amount of an impairment is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on management s view of growth rates for the related business  anticipated future economic conditions and estimates of residual values 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but rather are tested for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives and are subject to impairment evaluations 
the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level utilizing the market and income approaches 
the reporting units are the hackett group including benchmarking  business transformation  business transformation enterprise performance management epm  strategy and operations and executive advisory programs and hackett technology solutions including sap  oracle and oracle epm 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  we make estimates based on assumptions regarding various factors to determine if impairment tests are met 
these estimates contain management s judgment  using appropriate and customary assumptions available at the time 
as of december   neither of our reporting units were at risk of failing step one 
other intangible assets are tested for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if there has been an impairment 
the amount of an impairment is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value 
estimates of future undiscounted cash flows are based on management s view of growth rates for the related business  anticipated future economic conditions and estimates of residual values 
other intangible assets arise from business combinations and consist of customer relationships  customer backlog and trademarks that are amortized on a straight line or accelerated basis over periods of up to five years 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards  with limited exceptions  over the requisite service period 
restructuring reserves restructuring reserves reflect judgments and estimates of our ultimate costs of severance  closure and consolidation of facilities and settlement of contractual obligations under our operating leases  including sublease rental rates  absorption period to sublease space and other related costs 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
if these estimates change in the future or actual results differ from our estimates  we may be required to record additional charges 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting carrying values and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured by using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of certain state operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance  if any  that results from a change in circumstances  and which causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset  is included in the current tax provision 
we adopted a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
we report penalties and tax related interest expense as a component of income tax expense 
contingent liabilities we have certain contingent liabilities that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities 
we accrue contingent liabilities when it is probable that future expenditures will be made  and when such expenditures can be reasonably estimated 
reserves for contingent liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements based on management s assessment  along with legal counsel  of the expected outcome of the contingencies 
if the final outcome of our contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in income or a charge to earnings when determined 
the foregoing list was not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for us to judge the application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap
