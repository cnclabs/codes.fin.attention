item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
securitizations expose us to additional risks 
based on our manager s assessment of market conditions  we may acquire residential mortgage loans with the intention of securitizing them and retaining all or a part of the securitized assets in our portfolio 
to the extent that we securitize residential mortgage loans  we will often hold the most junior certificates associated with a securitization 
as a holder of the most junior certificates  we are more exposed to losses on the portfolio investments because the equity interest we retain in the issuing entity would be subordinate to the more senior notes typically issued to investors and we would  therefore  absorb all of the losses sustained with respect to a securitized pool of assets before the owners of the more senior notes experience any losses 
moreover  we believe that the return of an active private rmbs market is going to take some time to develop as rating agencies recalibrate risk metrics and sort through the evolving regulatory landscape for the private rmbs market  and we cannot be assured that we will be able to access the securitization market in the future  or be able to do so at favorable rates 
the inability to securitize our assets could hurt our performance and our ability to grow our business 
see market and business update  included under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our hedging we may enter into hedging transactions that could expose us to contingent liabilities in the future and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit  part of our strategy involves entering into hedging transactions that could require us to fund cash payments in certain circumstances eg  the early termination of the hedging instrument caused by an event of default or other early termination event  or the decision by a counterparty to request margin securities it is contractually owed under the terms of the hedging instrument 
the amount due would be equal to the unrealized loss of the open swap positions with the respective counterparty and could also include other fees and charges 
such losses would be reflected in our results of operations as realized losses 
our ability to fund these obligations will depend on the liquidity of our assets and access to capital at the time 
the need to fund these obligations could adversely impact our financial condition 
hedging against interest rate exposure may adversely affect our earnings  which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
our hedging activity varies in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates  the type of assets held and other changing market conditions 
our hedging transactions  which are intended to limit losses  may actually adversely affect our earnings  which could reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
in addition  hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges  guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house  or regulated by any us or foreign governmental authorities 
consequently  there are no requirements with respect to record keeping  financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions 
furthermore  the enforceability of agreements underlying hedging transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory  commodity and other regulatory requirements and  depending on the identity of the counterparty  applicable international requirements 
the business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in its default 
default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover our commitments  if any  at the then current market price 
although we generally seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions  it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order to cover our risk 
we cannot assure stockholders that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold  and we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration  which could result in losses 
our operating results may suffer because losses on the derivatives may not be offset by a change in the fair value of the related hedged transaction 
in order to mitigate interest rate risk resulting from our floating rate borrowings we enter into interest rate derivatives  currently comprised of swaps and swaptions 
our interest rate derivatives are intended to hedge the floating rate borrowings through the expected maturity of the underlying collateral 
we chose not to pursue hedge accounting for these derivative instruments for generally accepted in the us or  gaap purposes  and therefore record the change in estimated fair value of such instruments in earnings 
as a result  changes in the fair value of such instruments may result in us reporting losses on such instruments on our statement of operations 
to the extent that we invest in msrs and excess msrs in the future  the value of such msrs and excess msrs may be reduced substantially by changes in interest rates unless we are able to hedge against that uncertainty 
changes in interest rates are a key driver of the performance of msrs and excess msrs since the values of such assets are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates 
historically  the value of msrs and excess msrs has generally increased when interest rates rise and generally decreased when interest rates decline due to the effect those changes in interest rates have on prepayment estimates 
we may pursue various hedging strategies to seek to reduce our exposure to adverse changes in interest rates 
our hedging activity will vary in scope based on the level and volatility of interest rates  the type of assets held and other changing market conditions 
interest rate hedging may fail to protect us and or could adversely affect us 
to the extent we do not utilize derivatives to hedge against changes in fair value of the msrs or excess msrs that we may acquire  our balance sheet  financial condition and results of operations would be susceptible to volatility due to changes in the fair value of  or cash flows from  msrs and excess msrs as interest rates change 
risks related to our assets we may not realize gains or earn income from our assets  which could cause the value of our capital stock to decline 
we seek to generate attractive risk adjusted returns from our assets to our stockholders over the long term  primarily through dividend distributions and secondarily through capital appreciation 
however  the assets we acquire may not appreciate in value and may in fact decline in value  and the debt securities we acquire may default on interest and or principal payments 
accordingly  we may not be able to realize gains or income from our assets 
any gains that we do realize may not be sufficient to offset any other losses we experience 
any income that we realize may not be sufficient to offset our expenses 
we may acquire alt a and subprime mortgage loans and rmbs collateralized by alt a and subprime mortgage loans  which are subject to increased risks 
we may acquire alt a  subprime mortgage loans and rmbs backed by collateral pools of alt a and subprime mortgage loans  which are mortgage loans that have been originated using underwriting standards that are less restrictive than those used in underwriting prime mortgage loans 
these lower standards include mortgage loans made to borrowers having imperfect or impaired credit histories  mortgage loans where the amount of the loan at origination is or more of the value of the mortgage property  mortgage loans made to borrowers with low credit scores  mortgage loans made to borrowers who have other debt that represents a large portion of their income and mortgage loans made to borrowers whose income is not required to be disclosed or verified 
due to economic conditions  including increased interest rates and lower home prices  as well as aggressive lending practices  alt a and subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency  foreclosure  bankruptcy and loss  and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency  foreclosure  bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher  and that may be substantially higher  than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner 
thus  because of the higher delinquency rates and losses associated with alt a and subprime mortgage loans  the performance of rmbs backed by alt a and subprime mortgage loans that we may acquire could be correspondingly adversely affected  which could adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and business 
our portfolio of assets may be concentrated and may be subject to risk of default 
we have initially focused our strategy on acquiring and managing a portfolio of agency rmbs and non agency rmbs 
over time  we may further diversify to cover a broader range of other residential mortgage and mortgage related assets  including  but not limited to  residential mortgage loans  which we expect to source through bulk acquisitions of pools of whole loans originated by third parties  msrs and excess msrs 
however  we are not required to observe specific diversification criteria  except as may be set forth in the investment guidelines adopted by our board of directors 
therefore  our portfolio of assets may at times be concentrated in certain property types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure  or secured by properties concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations 
to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in any one region or type of security  downturns relating generally to such region or type of security may result in defaults on a number of our assets within a short time period  which may reduce our net income and the value of our shares and accordingly reduce our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
difficult conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage related assets as well as the broader financial markets have resulted in a significant contraction in liquidity for mortgages and mortgage related assets  which may adversely affect the value of the assets in which we invest 
our manager s use of models in connection with the valuation of our assets subjects us to potential risks in the event that such models are incorrect  misleading or based on incomplete information 
as part of the risk management process  our manager uses detailed proprietary models to evaluate  depending on the asset class  house price appreciation and depreciation by region  prepayment speeds and foreclosure frequency  cost and timing 
models and data are used to value assets or potential assets and also in connection with hedging our acquisitions 
many of the models are based on historical trends 
these trends may not be indicative of future results 
furthermore  the assumptions underlying the models may prove to be inaccurate  causing the models to also be incorrect 
in the event models and data prove to be incorrect  misleading or incomplete  any decisions made in reliance thereon expose us to potential risks 
for example  by relying on incorrect models and data  especially valuation models  our manager may be induced to buy certain assets at prices that are too high  to sell certain other assets at prices that are too low or to miss favorable opportunities altogether 
similarly  any hedging based on faulty models and data may prove to be unsuccessful 
our investments in non agency rmbs or other investment assets of lower credit quality involve credit risk  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
the holder of a mortgage or non agency rmbs assumes a risk that the borrowers may default on their obligations to make full and timely payments of principal and interest 
pursuant to our investment guidelines  we have the ability to acquire non agency rmbs and other investments that involve credit risk 
in general  non agency rmbs carry greater investment risk than agency rmbs because they are not guaranteed as to principal and or interest by the us government  any federal agency or any federally chartered corporation 
unexpectedly high rates of default eg  in excess of the default rates forecasted and or higher than expected loss severities on the mortgages collateralizing our non agency rmbs may adversely affect the value of such assets 
accordingly  non agency rmbs and other investment assets of lower credit quality could cause us to incur losses of income from  and or losses in market value relating to  these assets if there are defaults of principal and or interest on these assets 
we may have significant credit risk  especially on non agency rmbs  in certain geographic areas and may be disproportionately affected by economic or housing downturns  natural disasters  terrorist events  adverse climate changes or other adverse events specific to those markets 
a significant number of the mortgages collateralizing our rmbs may be concentrated in certain geographic areas 
for example  with respect to our non agency rmbs portfolio  we have significantly higher exposure in california  florida  new york  texas and illinois 
certain markets within these states particularly california and florida experienced significant decreases in residential home value during the recent housing crisis and continue to experience challenging economic and real estate conditions 
any event that adversely affects the economy or real estate market in these states could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our non agency rmbs portfolio 
in general  any material decline in the economy or significant difficulties in the real estate markets would be likely to cause a decline in the value of residential properties securing the mortgages in the relevant geographic area 
this  in turn  would increase the risk of delinquency  default and foreclosure on real estate collateralizing our non agency rmbs in this area 
this may then materially adversely affect our credit loss experience on our non agency rmbs in such area if unexpectedly high rates of default eg  in excess of the default rates forecasted and or higher than expected loss severities on the mortgages collateralizing such securities were to occur 
the occurrence of a natural disaster such as an earthquake  tornado  hurricane or a flood or a significant adverse climate change may cause a sudden decrease in the value of real estate and would likely reduce the value of the properties securing the mortgages collateralizing our non agency rmbs 
since certain natural disasters may not typically be covered by the standard hazard insurance policies maintained by borrowers  the borrowers may have to pay for repairs due to the disasters 
borrowers may not repair their property or may stop paying their mortgages under those circumstances 
this would likely cause defaults and credit loss severities to increase on the pool of mortgages securing our non agency rmbs which  unlike agency rmbs  are not guaranteed as to principal and or interest by the us government  any federal agency or federally chartered corporation 
we have some investments in non agency rmbs collateralized by alt a loans and subprime mortgage loans  which  due to lower underwriting standards  are subject to increased risk of losses 
we have certain investments in non agency rmbs backed by collateral pools containing mortgage loans that have been originated using underwriting standards that are less strict than those used in underwriting prime mortgage loans 
these lower standards permit mortgage loans made to borrowers having impaired credit histories  mortgage loans where the amount of the loan at origination is or more of the value of the mortgage property  mortgage loans made to borrowers with low credit scores  mortgage loans made to borrowers who have other debt that represents a large portion of their income and mortgage loans made to borrowers whose income is not required to be disclosed or verified 
due to economic conditions  including increased interest rates and lower home prices  as well as aggressive lending practices  alt a and subprime mortgage loans have in recent periods experienced increased rates of delinquency  foreclosure  bankruptcy and loss  and they are likely to continue to experience delinquency  foreclosure  bankruptcy and loss rates that are higher  and that may be substantially higher  than those experienced by mortgage loans underwritten in a more traditional manner 
thus  because of higher delinquency rates and losses associated with alt a and subprime mortgage loans  the performance of non agency rmbs backed by these types of loans that we may acquire could be correspondingly adversely affected  which could materially adversely impact our results of operations  financial condition and business 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect the value of our assets and cause our interest expense to increase  which could result in reduced earnings or losses and negatively affect our profitability as well as the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
we focus primarily on investing in  financing and managing agency rmbs  non agency rmbs  residential mortgage loans and other residential mortgage assets in the united states 
in a normal yield curve environment  some of these types of assets will generally decline in value if long term interest rates increase 
declines in market value may ultimately reduce earnings or result in losses to us  which may negatively affect cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
a significant risk associated with these assets is the risk that both long term and short term interest rates will increase significantly 
if long term rates increased significantly  the market value of these assets could decline  and the duration and weighted average life of the assets could increase 
we could realize a loss if the securities were sold 
at the same time  an increase in short term interest rates would increase the amount of interest owed on the repurchase agreements we may enter into to finance the purchase of these securities 
market values of our assets may decline without any general increase in interest rates for a number of reasons  such as increases or expected increases in defaults  increases or expected increases in voluntary prepayments for those assets that are subject to prepayment risk or widening of credit spreads 
in addition  in a period of rising interest rates  our operating results will depend in large part on the difference between the income from our assets  net of credit losses  and financing costs 
in most cases  the income from such assets will respond more slowly to interest rate fluctuations than the cost of our borrowings 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net income 
increases in these rates will tend to decrease our net income and the market value of our assets 
interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect the value of our assets  net income and capital stock 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
interest rate fluctuations present a variety of risks  including the risk of a narrowing of the difference between asset yields and borrowing rates  flattening or inversion of the yield curve and fluctuating prepayment rates  and may adversely affect our income and the value of our capital stock 
additionally  our operating results and prospects may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors or may be lower than those of companies with comparable market capitalizations  which could lead to a material decline in the market price of our capital stock 
our investments are recorded at fair value and  as a result  there may be uncertainty as to the value of these assets 
the assets in our investment portfolio are comprised of securities that trade in a market that may experience periods of illiquidity or market dislocation 
we value our investments at fair value  as defined by gaap  which valuations may from time to time  require us to use assumptions that may not be unobservable in the marketplace  particularly in periods of market dislocation or illiquidity for such investments 
our assumptions  could cause our estimate of value for our investments to be subjective  with the fair value of such investments differing materially from the values in a liquid market 
there can be no assurance that the values that we arrive at for our investments can be realized upon the sale of such investments in the marketplace  due both to the potential subjectivity of our valuations and the fact that market values of our investments can be become very volatile depending on market conditions and the performance of certain investments 
the failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying certain of the assets in our portfolio could materially and adversely affect our investments in non agency rmbs and mortgage loans 
most residential mortgage loans and securitizations of residential mortgage loans require a servicer to manage collections on each of the underlying loans 
both default frequency and default severity of loans may depend upon the quality of the servicer 
if servicers are not vigilant in encouraging borrowers to make their monthly payments  the borrowers may be far less likely to make these payments  which could result in a higher frequency of default 
if servicers take longer to liquidate non performing assets  loss severities may tend to be higher than originally anticipated 
the failure of servicers to effectively service the mortgage loans underlying certain assets in our portfolio could negatively impact the value of our investments and our performance 
many servicers have gone out of business in recent years  requiring a transfer of servicing to another servicer 
this transfer takes time and loans may become delinquent because of confusion or lack of attention 
in the case of pools of securitized loans  servicers may be required to advance interest on delinquent loans to the extent the servicer deems those advances recoverable 
in the event the servicer does not advance  interest may be interrupted even on more senior securities 
servicers may also advance more interest than is in fact recoverable once a defaulted loan is disposed  and the loss to the trust may be greater than the outstanding principal balance of that loan greater than loss severity 
any credit ratings assigned to our assets will be subject to ongoing evaluations and revisions and we cannot assure investors that those ratings will not be downgraded 
some of our assets are rated by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations 
any credit ratings on our assets are subject to ongoing evaluation by rating agencies  and we cannot assure investors that any such ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if  in its judgment  circumstances warrant 
if rating agencies assign a lower than expected rating or reduce or withdraw  or indicate that they may reduce or withdraw  their ratings of our assets in the future  the value of these assets could significantly decline  which would adversely affect the value of our portfolio and could result in losses  our disposition  or the failure of borrowers to satisfy their debt service obligations to us 
a prolonged economic slowdown  a lengthy or severe recession or declining real estate values could impair our assets and harm our operations 
we believe the risks associated with our business will be more severe during periods of economic slowdown or recession  especially if these periods are accompanied by declining real estate values 
our non agency rmbs and residential mortgage loans will be particularly sensitive to these risks 
a decline in real estate values will likely reduce the level of new mortgage loan originations since borrowers often use appreciation in the value of their existing properties to support the purchase of additional properties 
borrowers may also be less able or inclined to continue to honor their mortgage obligations if the value of real estate weakens  particularly in situations where balance of the mortgage loan exceeds the value of the mortgaged property 
as a result  a decline in real estate values significantly increases the likelihood that we will incur losses on our non agency rmbs and mortgage loans in the event of default because the value of property securing such investments may be insufficient for us to recover our investment 
any sustained period of increased payment delinquencies  foreclosures or losses could adversely affect both our net interest income from non agency rmbs and residential mortgage loans in our portfolio  as well as our manager s ability to acquire  sell and securitize residential mortgage loans  which would significantly harm our revenues  results of operations  financial condition  business prospects and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
prepayment rates may adversely affect the value of our portfolio of assets 
the value of our assets may be affected by prepayment rates on mortgage loans 
if we purchase assets at a premium to par value  when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans faster than expected  the corresponding prepayments on the mortgage related securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will have to amortize the related premium on faster than anticipated when we invested in such securities 
conversely  if we purchase assets at a discount to par value  when borrowers prepay their mortgage loans slower than expected  the decrease in corresponding prepayments on the mortgage related securities may reduce the expected yield on such securities because we will not be able to accrete the related discount as quickly as originally anticipated 
prepayment rates on loans may be affected by a number of factors including  but not limited to  the availability of mortgage credit  the relative economic vitality of the area in which the related properties are located  the servicing of the mortgage loans  possible changes in tax laws  other opportunities for investment  homeowner mobility and other economic  social  geographic  demographic and legal factors and other factors beyond our control 
consequently  such prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty and no strategy can completely insulate us from prepayment or other such risks 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayment rates on mortgage loans generally increase 
in addition  prepayments received during periods of declining interest rates are likely to be reinvested by us in assets with yields that are lower than the investments that prepaid 
in addition  the market value of the assets may  because of the risk of prepayment  benefit less than other fixed income securities from declining interest rates 
we invest in agency io and inverse io securities  which are highly sensitive to prepayments and or changes in interest rates 
as the underlying mortgages are paid off  the future stream of interest on such securities is reduced 
faster prepayments than we anticipated on the underlying loans backing our io and inverse io securities will have an adverse effect on our returns on these investments 
the mortgage loans that we acquire  and the mortgage and other loans underlying the rmbs that we acquire  are subject to delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
residential mortgage loans are secured by one to four family residential properties and are subject to risks of delinquency  foreclosure and loss 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by a residential property typically is dependent upon the income or assets of the borrower 
a number of factors  including a general economic downturn  natural disasters  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances  may impair borrowers abilities to repay their loans 
in addition  we intend to acquire non agency rmbs  which are backed by residential real property but  in contrast to agency rmbs  their principal and interest are not guaranteed by federally chartered entities such as fannie mae and freddie mac and  in the case of ginnie mae  the us government 
the ability of a borrower to repay these loans or other financial assets is dependent upon the income or assets of these borrowers 
in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held directly by us  we bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow from operations 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy as determined by the bankruptcy court  and the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
certain investments in whole mortgage loans may require us to purchase less desirable mortgage assets as part of an otherwise desirable pool of mortgage assets  which could subject us to additional risks relating to the less desirable mortgage assets 
if we acquire whole mortgage loans  we may be required to purchase other types of mortgage assets as part of an available pool of mortgage assets in order to acquire the desired whole loans 
these other mortgage assets may include mortgage assets that subject us to additional risks 
acquisition of less desirable mortgage assets may impair our performance and reduce the return on our investments 
we are subject to counterparty risk and may be unable to seek indemnity or require our counterparties to repurchase mortgage loans if they breach representations and warranties  which could cause us to suffer losses 
when selling mortgage loans  sellers typically make customary representations and warranties about such loans 
our residential mortgage loan purchase agreements may entitle us to seek indemnity or demand repurchase or substitution of the loans in the event our counterparty breaches a representation or warranty given to us 
however  there can be no assurance that our mortgage loan purchase agreements will contain appropriate representations and warranties  that we will be able to enforce our contractual right to repurchase or substitution  or that our counterparty will remain solvent or otherwise be able to honor its obligations under its mortgage loan purchase agreements 
our inability to obtain indemnity or require repurchase of a significant number of loans could harm our business  financial condition  liquidity  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our real estate assets are subject to risks particular to real property  which may reduce our return from an affected property or asset and reduce or eliminate our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we own assets secured by real estate and may own real estate directly in the future  either through direct acquisitions or upon a default of mortgage loans 
real estate investments are subject to various risks  including natural disasters  including earthquakes  floods and other natural disasters  which may result in uninsured losses  acts of war or terrorism  including the consequences of terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   adverse changes in national and local economic and market conditions  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances  costs of remediation and liabilities associated with environmental conditions such as indoor mold  and the potential for uninsured or under insured property losses 
if any of these or similar events occur  it may reduce our return from an affected property or asset and reduce or eliminate our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
liability relating to environmental matters may impact the value of properties that we may acquire or the properties underlying our investments 
under various us federal  state and local laws  an owner or operator of real property may become liable for the costs of removal of certain hazardous substances released on its property 
these laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous substances 
the presence of hazardous substances may adversely affect an owner s ability to sell real estate or borrow using real estate as collateral 
to the extent that an owner of a property underlying one of our debt investments becomes liable for removal costs  the ability of the owner to make payments to us may be reduced  which in turn may adversely affect the value of the relevant mortgage asset held by us and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in the course of our business  we may take title to real estate  and if so  could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the presence of hazardous substances  if any  on our properties may adversely affect our ability to sell the affected properties and incur substantial remediation costs  thus harming our financial condition 
the discovery of material environmental liabilities attached to such properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
to the extent that we invest in msrs in the future  the value that we may realize from msrs and excess msrs may be significantly less than the fair values of such assets reflected on our balance sheet 
we may invest in msrs  which arise from contractual agreements between us and the investors or their agents in mortgage securities and mortgage loans 
excess msrs are interests in mortgage servicing rights  representing a portion of the fee paid to mortgage servicers 
the fee that a mortgage servicer is entitled to receive for servicing a pool of mortgages generally exceeds the reasonable compensation that would be charged in an arm s length transaction 
for example  fannie mae and freddie mac generally require mortgage servicers to be paid a minimum servicing fee that significantly exceeds the amount a servicer would charge in an arm s length transaction 
the portion of the fee in excess of what would be charged in an arm s length transaction is commonly referred to as the excess mortgage servicing fee 
subject to maintaining our qualification as a reit and our exclusion from registration as an investment company under the act  we may acquire msrs from the sale of mortgage loans where we assume the obligation to service the loan in connection with the sale transaction or we may purchase msrs and excess msrs 
any msrs and excess msrs that we acquire will be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
the determination of the fair value of msrs and excess msrs will require our management to make numerous estimates and assumptions 
such estimates and assumptions include  without limitation  estimates of future cash flows associated with msrs based upon assumptions involving interest rates as well as the prepayment rates  delinquencies and foreclosure rates of the underlying serviced mortgage loans 
the ultimate realization of the value of msrs and excess msrs may be materially different than the fair values of such assets as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as of any particular date 
the use of different estimates or assumptions in connection with the valuation of these assets could produce materially different fair values for such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
accordingly  there may be material uncertainty about the fair value of any msrs or excess msrs we acquire 
furthermore  msrs  excess msrs and the related servicing activities are subject to numerous us federal  state and local laws and regulations and may be subject to various judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions on our business 
our failure to comply  or the failure of the servicer to comply  with the laws  rules or regulations to which we or they are subjected by virtue of ownership of msrs or excess msrs  whether actual or alleged  could expose us to fines  penalties or potential litigation liabilities  including costs  settlements and judgments  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be affected by deficiencies in foreclosure practices of third parties  as well as related delays in the foreclosure process 
allegations of deficiencies in foreclosure documentation and servicing and foreclosure practices by among others  several large servicers of residential mortgage loans that surfaced recently raised various concerns relating to such practices 
as a result of these alleged deficiencies in foreclosure practices  a number of servicers temporarily suspended foreclosure proceedings beginning in the second half of while they evaluated their foreclosure practices 
in addition  on february   a group consisting of state attorneys general and state bank and mortgage regulators in states reached a settlement with the largest mortgage servicers regarding foreclosure practices in the states various jurisdictions 
on january  the office of the comptroller of the currency and the board of governors of the federal reserve system announced a settlement with a number of mortgage servicers in lieu of continuing a foreclosure review process  under which borrowers who believed they were financially harmed by the foreclosure process in and were able to request an independent review of the process 
the settlement  which includes funds for both direct payments to eligible borrowers and for other assistance such as loan modifications and forgiveness of deficiency judgments  ended the case by case reviews 
the extension of foreclosure timelines increases the inventory backlog of distressed homes on the market and creates greater uncertainty about housing prices 
we may incur substantial legal fees and court costs in acquiring a property through contested foreclosure or bankruptcy proceedings 
we intend to continue to monitor and review the issues raised by the alleged improper foreclosure practices 
we cannot predict exactly how the servicing and foreclosure matters or the resulting litigation or settlement agreements will affect our business and cannot assure you that these matters will not impair our performance and reduce the return on our investments 
the lack of liquidity of our assets may adversely affect our business  including our ability to value and sell our assets 
we may acquire assets or other instruments that are not liquid  including securities and other instruments that are not publicly traded 
moreover  turbulent market conditions  could significantly and negatively impact the liquidity of our assets 
illiquid assets typically experience greater price volatility  as a ready market does not exist  and can be more difficult to value 
in addition  validating third party pricing for illiquid assets may be more subjective than more liquid assets 
the illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult to sell such assets if the need or desire arises 
in addition  if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly  we may realize significantly less than the value at which we had previously recorded such assets 
to the extent that we utilize leverage to finance our purchase of assets that are or become illiquid  the negative impact on us related to trying to sell assets quickly could be greatly exacerbated 
as a result  our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be relatively limited  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
although the immediate effect of the federal reserves third round of quantitative easing or  qe was an increase of agency and non agency rmbs prices  there is no certainty as to what effect qe and other recently announced governmental actions might have in the future on the price and liquidity of the securities in which we invest 
however  the confluence of such factors as qe and further governmental efforts to increase home loan refinancing opportunities could simultaneously raise agency rmbs prices and increase prepayment activity  which could place downward pressure on our net interest margin 
on september   the federal reserve announced a third round of quantitative easing  or qe  which is an open ended program designed to expand the federal reserve s holdings of long term securities by purchasing an additional billion of agency rmbs per month until key economic indicators  such as the unemployment rate  show signs of improvement 
when combined with programs to extend the average maturity of the federal reserve s holdings of securities  which is known as operation twist and described below  and reinvest principal and interest payments from the federal reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency rmbs into agency rmbs  qe was expected to increase the federal reserve s holdings of long term securities by billion each month through the end of the federal reserve also announced that it would keep the target range for the federal funds rate between zero and through at least mid  which is six months longer than previously expected 
the federal reserve provided further guidance to the market in december by stating that it intended to keep the federal funds rate close to zero while the unemployment rate is above and as long as inflation does not rise above 
in december  the federal reserve also announced that it would initially begin buying billion of long term treasury bonds each month and noted that such amount may increase in the future 
this bond purchase program replaced the program known as operation twist  in which the federal reserve repurchased approximately billion of long term treasury bonds each month and sold approximately the same amount of short term treasury bonds 
the federal reserve expects these measures to put downward pressure on long term interest rates 
the immediate impact of the announcement of qe was an increase in agency and non agency rmbs prices 
this effect was especially pronounced on agency rmbs that the federal reserve was expected to target for acquisition under qe since the initial price spike  prices for all but the target securities have receded below the price levels that existed before the announcement of qe to the extent that the scope and effectiveness of government sponsored refinancing programs increases  prepayments on our target securities could increase accordingly 
the combination of higher prices and higher refinancing activity on our agency rmbs could decrease our interest rate spread and net interest margin 
to the extent qe decreases the liquidity in the market for agency rmbs with the attributed we focus on  which has yet to be the case  we might not be able to acquire the securities we target or acquire them in the quantities we desire 
we maintain cash balances in our bank accounts that exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation limitation 
we regularly maintain cash balances at a single bank domiciled in the united states in excess of the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limit 
the failure of such bank could result in the loss of a portion of such cash balances in excess of the federally insured limit  which could materially and adversely affect our financial position 
risks related to our capital stock common stock and preferred stock eligible for future sale may have adverse effects on our share price 
subject to applicable law  our board of directors has the power  without further stockholder approval  to authorize us to issue additional authorized shares of common stock and preferred stock on the terms and for the consideration it deems appropriate 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  of future sales of our capital stock  or the availability of shares for future sales  on the market price of our common stock or preferred stock 
the market price of our common stock may decline significantly when the restrictions on resale by certain of our stockholders lapse 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock  preferred stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock 
if our portfolio of assets generates insufficient income and cash flow  we could be required to sell assets  borrow funds  make a portion of our distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities to fund our distributions 
we are generally required to distribute to our stockholders at least of our taxable income each year for us to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code  which requirement we currently satisfy through quarterly distributions of all or substantially all of our reit taxable income in such year  subject to certain adjustments 
our ability to make distributions may be adversely affected by a number of factors 
although we make quarterly distributions to our stockholders  our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing  form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders 
if our portfolio of assets generates insufficient income and cash flow to fund our dividends  we could be required to sell assets  borrow funds or make a portion of our distributions in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities 
to the extent that we are required to sell assets in adverse market conditions or borrow funds at unfavorable rates  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our board of directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon various factors  including our earnings  our financial condition  our liquidity  our debt and preferred stock covenants  maintenance of our reit qualification  applicable provisions of the maryland general corporation law or  mgcl and other factors as our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
we believe that a change in any one of the following factors could adversely affect our results of operations and impair our ability to make distributions to our stockholders our ability to make profitable investments  margin calls or other expenses that reduce our cash flow  defaults in our asset portfolio or decreases in the value of our portfolio  and a significant increase in our operating expenses 
as a result  no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders at any time in the future or that the level of any distributions we do make to our stockholders will achieve a market yield  increase or even be maintained over time  any of which could materially and adversely affect the value of our common stock 
in addition  distributions that we make to our stockholders will generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary income 
however  a portion of our distributions may be designated by us as long term capital gains to the extent that they are attributable to capital gain income recognized by us or may constitute a return of capital to the extent that they exceed our earnings and profits as determined for tax purposes 
a return of capital is not taxable  but has the effect of reducing the basis of a stockholder s investment in shares of our common stock 
future offerings of debt or equity securities  which may rank senior to our common stock  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and result in dilution to owners of our common stock 
if we decide to issue debt securities in the future  which would rank senior to our common stock  it is likely that they will be governed by an indenture or other instrument containing covenants restricting our operating flexibility 
in september  we issued  of preferred stock 
no dividends may be paid on our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our preferred stock 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock  including in connection with conversions of our outstanding preferred stock  or other future issuances convertible securities  including outstanding options and warrants  or otherwise  will dilute the ownership interest of our common stockholders 
additionally  any equity securities or convertible or exchangeable securities that we issue in the future may have rights  preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our common stock and may result in dilution to owners of our common stock 
we and  indirectly  our stockholders  will bear the cost of issuing and servicing such securities 
because our decision to issue debt or equity securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our common stock will bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting the value of their stock holdings in us 
risks related to our organization and structure certain provisions of the mgcl could inhibit changes in control 
certain provisions of the mgcl may have the effect of deterring a third party from making a proposal to acquire us or of impeding a change in control under circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of our common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
we are subject to the business combination provisions of the mgcl that  subject to limitations  prohibit certain business combinations including a merger  consolidation  share exchange  or  in circumstances specified in the statute  an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities between us and an interested stockholder defined generally as any person who beneficially owns or more of our then outstanding voting stock or an affiliate or our associate who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of or more of our then outstanding voting stock or an affiliate thereof for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
after the five year prohibition  any business combination between us and an interested stockholder generally must be recommended by our board of directors and approved by the affirmative vote of at least i of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding shares of our voting stock and ii two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of our voting stock other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom or with whose affiliate the business combination is to be effected or held by an affiliate or associate of the interested stockholder 
these super majority vote requirements do not apply if our common stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined under mgcl  for their shares in the form of cash or other consideration in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for our shares 
these provisions of the mgcl do not apply  however  to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
pursuant to the statute  our board of directors has by resolution exempted business combinations i between us and any other person  provided that such business combination is first approved by our board of directors including a majority of our directors who are not affiliates or associates of such person  ii between us and apollo and its affiliates and associates and iii persons acting in concert with any of the foregoing 
as a result  any person described above may be able to enter into business combinations with us that may not be in the best interests of our stockholders  without compliance by us with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the statute 
there can be no assurance that our board of directors will not amend or revoke this exemption in the future 
the control share provisions of the mgcl provide that a holder of control shares of a maryland corporation defined as shares which  when aggregated with all other shares controlled by the stockholder  except solely by virtue of a revocable proxy  entitle the stockholder to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors acquired in a control share acquisition defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of ownership or control of issued and outstanding control shares has no voting rights with respect to such shares except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter  excluding votes entitled to be cast by the acquirer of control shares  our officers and personnel who are also directors 
our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our stock 
there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future 
the unsolicited takeover provisions of the mgcl permit our board of directors  without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws  to implement takeover defenses  some of which for example  a classified board we do not yet have 
our charter contains a provision whereby we have elected to be subject to the provisions of title  subtitle of the mgcl relating to the filling of vacancies on our board of directors as a result of which  vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by the remaining directors  even if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum 
these provisions may have the effect of inhibiting a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us or of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us under the circumstances that otherwise could provide the holders of shares of common stock with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then current market price 
our authorized but unissued shares of common and preferred stock may prevent a change in our control 
our charter permits our board of directors to authorize us to issue additional shares of our authorized but unissued common or preferred stock 
in addition  our board of directors may  without stockholder approval  amend our charter to increase the aggregate number of our shares of stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have the authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
as a result  our directors may establish a series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for shares of our common stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders 
our rights and the rights of our stockholders to take action against our directors and officers are limited  which could limit recourse available holders of our capital stock in the event of actions not in their best interests 
our charter limits the liability of our present and former directors and officers to us and our stockholders for money damages to the maximum extent permitted under maryland law 
under maryland law  our present and former directors and officers do not have any liability to us and our stockholders for money damages other than liability resulting from actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money  property or services  or active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was established by a final judgment and was material to the cause of action adjudicated 
our charter authorizes us to indemnify our directors and officers for actions taken by them in those and other capacities to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law 
our bylaws require us to indemnify each present and former director or officer  to the maximum extent permitted by maryland law  in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made  or threatened to be made  a party by reason of his or her service to us 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers pursuant to which we may be obligated to pay or reimburse the defense costs incurred by our present and former directors and officers without requiring a preliminary determination of their ultimate entitlement to indemnification 
our charter contains provisions that make removal of our directors difficult  which could make it difficult for stockholders to effect changes to our management 
our charter provides that  subject to the rights of any series of preferred stock  a director may be removed with or without cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast generally in the election of directors 
vacancies may be filled only by a majority of the remaining directors in office  even if less than a quorum 
these requirements make it more difficult to change our management by removing and replacing directors and may prevent a change in control of us that is in the best interests of stockholders 
ownership limitations may restrict change of control or business combination opportunities in which our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of any calendar year  and at least persons must beneficially own our stock during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate portion of a shorter taxable year 
individuals for this purpose include natural persons  private foundations  some employee benefit plans and trusts  and some charitable trusts 
to preserve our reit qualification  among other purposes  our charter generally prohibits any person from directly or indirectly owning more than in value or in number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the outstanding shares of our capital stock or more than in value or in number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
the articles supplementary for our preferred stock prohibits any stockholder from beneficially or constructively owning more than in value or in number of shares  whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding preferred stock 
these ownership limits could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price or which holders might believe to be otherwise in their best interests 
our board of directors have established exemptions from the ownership limits which permit apollo and certain of its affiliates to collectively hold up to of our common stock and certain private fund investors to collectively hold up to the greater of  shares of our common stock or of our common stock 
risks related to our taxation as a reit qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code  and our failure to qualify as a reit or remain qualified as a reit would subject us to us federal income tax and applicable state and local taxes  which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
we have elected to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we have not requested and do not intend to request a ruling from the internal revenue service or  irs that we qualify as a reit 
the us federal income tax laws governing reits are complex  and judicial and administrative interpretations of the us federal income tax laws governing reit qualification are limited 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet  on an ongoing basis  various tests regarding the nature and diversification of our assets and our income  the ownership of our outstanding shares  and the amount of our distributions 
even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification 
our ability to satisfy the reit asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets  some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination 
our compliance with the reit income and quarterly asset requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our income and assets on an ongoing basis 
moreover  new legislation  court decisions or administrative guidance  in each case possibly with retroactive effect  may make it more difficult or impossible for us to qualify as a reit 
in addition  our ability to satisfy the requirements to qualify as a reit depends in part on the actions of third parties over which we have no control or only limited influence  including in cases where we own an equity interest in an entity that is classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes 
thus  while we currently operate so that we will qualify as a reit  given the highly complex nature of the rules governing reits  the ongoing importance of factual determinations  and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  no assurance can be given that we will so qualify for any particular year 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  and we do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  we would be required to pay us federal income tax on our taxable income  and distributions to our stockholders would not be deductible by us in determining our taxable income 
in such a case  we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay our taxes 
our payment of income tax would decrease the amount of our income available for distribution to stockholders 
furthermore  if we fail to maintain our qualification as a reit  we no longer would be required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to stockholders 
in addition  unless we were eligible for certain statutory relief provisions  we could not re elect to qualify as a reit for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify 
complying with reit requirements may force us to liquidate or forego otherwise attractive investments 
to qualify as a reit  we must ensure that we meet the reit gross income tests annually and that  at the end of each calendar quarter  at least of the value of our assets consists of cash  cash items  government securities  shares in reits and other qualifying real estate assets  including certain mortgage loans and certain kinds of mortgage backed securities 
the remainder of our investments in securities other than government securities and reit qualified real estate assets generally cannot include more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
in addition  in general  no more than of the value of our assets other than government securities and securities that are qualifying real estate assets can consist of the securities of any one issuer  and no more than of the value of our total securities can be represented by securities of one or more trss 
if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter  we must correct the failure within days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences 
as a result  we may be required to liquidate from our portfolio  or contribute to a trs  otherwise attractive investments  and may be unable to pursue investments that would be otherwise advantageous to us in order to satisfy the source of income or asset diversification requirements for qualifying as a reit 
these actions could have the effect of reducing our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders 
reit distribution requirements may cause us to forego attractive investment opportunities and or may require us to incur debt or sell assets to make such distributions 
in order to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our stockholders  each calendar year  at least of our reit taxable income including certain items of non cash income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy the distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed income 
in addition  we will incur a nondeductible excise tax on the amount  if any  by which our distributions in any calendar year are less than a minimum amount specified under us federal income tax laws 
we distribute our net income to our stockholders in a manner intended to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax 
our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined based on gaap because  for example  realized capital losses will be deducted in determining our gaap net income  but may not be deductible in computing our taxable income 
in addition  we may invest in assets that generate taxable income in excess of economic income or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from the assets  referred to as phantom income 
although some types of phantom income are excluded in determining the distribution requirement  we will incur corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax with respect to any phantom income items if we do not distribute those items on an annual basis 
in addition  our taxable income may substantially exceed our net income as determined by gaap or differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash may occur 
for example  we may be required to accrue interest and discount income on mortgage loans  rmbs  and other types of debt securities or interests in debt securities before we receive any payments of interest or principal on such assets 
we may also acquire distressed debt instruments that are subsequently modified by agreement with the borrower 
if the amendments to the outstanding debt are significant modifications under the applicable treasury regulations  the modified debt may be considered to have been reissued to us at a gain in a debt for debt exchange with the borrower  with gain recognized by us to the extent that the principal amount of the modified debt exceeds our cost of purchasing it prior to modification 
we may be required under the terms of the indebtedness that we incur  whether to private lenders or pursuant to government programs  to use cash received from interest payments to make principal payment on that indebtedness  with the effect that we will recognize income but will not have a corresponding amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
as a result of the foregoing  we may generate less cash flow than taxable income in a particular year and find it difficult or impossible to meet the reit distribution requirements in certain circumstances 
in such circumstances  we may be required to i sell assets in adverse market conditions  ii borrow on unfavorable terms  iii distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions  capital expenditures or repayment of debt or iv make a taxable distribution of our shares as part of a distribution in which stockholders may elect to receive shares or subject to a limit measured as a percentage of the total distribution cash  in order to comply with the reit distribution requirements and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
thus  compliance with the reit distribution requirements may hinder our ability to grow  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
even if we qualify as a reit  we may face tax liabilities that reduce our cash flow 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain us federal  state and local taxes on our income and assets  including taxes on any undistributed income  tax on income from some activities conducted as a result of a foreclosure  and state or local income  franchise  property and transfer taxes  including mortgage recording taxes 
we also could  in certain circumstances  be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the internal revenue code to maintain our qualification as a reit 
in addition  any trs we own will be subject to us federal  state and local corporate taxes 
in order to meet the reit qualification requirements  or to avoid the imposition of a tax that applies to certain gains derived by a reit from sales of inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  we may hold some of our assets through trss 
any taxes paid by us or our trss would decrease the cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
the failure of mortgage loans or rmbs subject to a repurchase agreement to qualify as a real estate asset would adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
when we enter into repurchase agreements  we will nominally sell certain of our assets to a counterparty and simultaneously enter into an agreement to repurchase the sold assets 
we believe that we will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the owner of the assets that are the subject of any such agreements notwithstanding that such agreements may transfer record ownership of the assets to the counterparty during the term of the agreement 
it is possible  however  that the irs could assert that we did not own the assets during the term of the repurchase agreement  in which case we could fail to qualify as a reit 
we may be required to report taxable income for certain investments in excess of the economic income we ultimately realize from them 
we have acquired and intend to continue to acquire non agency rmbs at prices that reflect significant market discounts on their unpaid principal balances 
under gaap  we generally establish a portion of this market discount as a credit deserve 
this credit deserve is generally not accreted into income for financial statement reporting purposes 
for tax purposes  however  we are not permitted to anticipate  or establish a reserve for  credit losses prior to their occurrence 
as a result  the entire market discount is accreted into income in determining taxable income during periods in which no actual losses are incurred 
losses are only recognized for tax purposes when incurred thus lowering taxable income in periods in which losses are incurred 
these differences between tax and gaap in recognizing revenue can lead to significant timing variances in the recognition of income and losses 
taxable income on non agency rmbs purchased at a discount to their par value may be higher than gaap earnings in early periods before losses are actually incurred 
because we distribute dividends to our stockholders based on our taxable income  our dividend distributions could exceed our gaap income in periods during which our taxable income exceeds our gaap income on our non agency rmbs purchased at discount to par value 
similarly  some of the rmbs that we acquire may have been issued with original issue discount or  oid 
we will be required to report such original issue discount based on a constant yield method and will be taxed based on the assumption that all future projected payments due on such rmbs will be made 
if such rmbs turns out not to be fully collectible  an offsetting loss deduction will become available only in the later year that uncollectability is provable 
finally  in the event that any debt instruments or rmbs acquired by us are delinquent as to mandatory principal and interest payments  or in the event payments with respect to a particular debt instrument are not made when due  we may nonetheless be required to continue to recognize the unpaid interest as taxable income as it accrues  despite doubt as to its ultimate collectability 
similarly  we may be required to accrue interest income with respect to subordinate mortgage backed securities at its stated rate regardless of whether corresponding cash payments are received or are ultimately collectable 
in each case  while we would in general ultimately have an offsetting loss deduction available to us when such interest was determined to be uncollectible  the utility of that deduction could depend on us having taxable income in that later year or thereafter 
we may acquire excess msrs  which means the portion of an msr that exceeds the arm s length fee for services performed by the mortgage service 
based on internal revenue service guidance concerning the classification of excess msrs to the extent we acquire excess msrs  we intend to treat such excess msrs as ownership interests in the interest payments made on the underlying mortgage loans  akin to an interest only strip 
under this treatment  for purposes of determining the amount and timing of taxable income  each excess msr is treated as a bond that was issued with oid on the date we acquired such excess msr 
in general  we will be required to accrue oid based on the constant yield to maturity of each excess msr  and to treat such oid as taxable income in accordance with the applicable us federal income tax rules 
the constant yield of an excess msr will be determined  and we will be taxed  based on a prepayment assumption regarding future payments due on the mortgage loans underlying the excess msr 
if the mortgage loans underlying an excess msr prepay at a rate different than that under the prepayment assumption  our recognition of oid will be either increased or decreased depending on the circumstances 
thus  in a particular taxable year  we may be required to accrue an amount of income in respect of an excess msr that exceeds the amount of cash collected in respect of that excess msr 
furthermore  it is possible that  over the life of the investment in an excess msr  the total amount we pay for  and accrue with respect to  the excess msr may exceed the total amount we collect on such excess msr 
no assurance can be given that we will be entitled to a deduction for such excess  meaning that we may be required to recognize phantom income over the life of an excess msr  which will impact our reit distribution requirements 
the interest apportionment rules may affect our ability to comply with the reit asset and gross income tests 
the interest apportionment rules under treasury regulation section c provide that  if a mortgage is secured by both real property and other property  a reit is required to apportion its annual interest income to the real property security based on a fraction  the numerator of which is the value of the real property securing the loan  determined when the reit commits to acquire the loan  and the denominator of which is the highest principal amount of the loan during the year 
irs revenue procedure interprets the principal amount of the loan to be the face amount of the loan  despite the internal revenue code requiring taxpayers to treat any market discount  that is the difference between the purchase price of the loan and its face amount  for all purposes other than certain withholding and information reporting purposes as interest rather than principal 
the interest apportionment regulations apply only if the mortgage loan in question is secured by both real property and other property 
we expect that all or most of the mortgage loans that we acquire will be secured only by real property and no other property value is taken into account in our underwriting process 
accordingly  it is not contemplated that we will invest in mortgage loans to which the interest apportionment rules described above would apply 
nevertheless  if the irs were to assert successfully that our mortgage loans were secured by property other than real estate  the interest apportionment rules applied for purposes of our reit testing  and that the position taken in irs revenue procedure should be applied to certain mortgage loans in our portfolio  then depending upon the value of the real property securing our mortgage loans and their face amount  and the sources of our gross income generally  we may fail to meet the reit gross income test 
if we do not meet this test  we could potentially lose our reit qualification or be required to pay a penalty to the irs 
in addition  the internal revenue code provides that a regular or a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit or  remic is generally treated as a real estate asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests  and any amount includible in our gross income with respect to such an interest is generally treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the reit gross income tests 
if  however  less than of the assets of a remic in which we hold an interest consist of real estate assets determined as if we held such assets  we will be treated as holding our proportionate share of the assets of the remic for the purpose of the reit asset tests and receive directly our proportionate share of the income of the remic for the purpose of determining the amount of income from the remic that is treated as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property 
in connection with the expanded home affordable refinance program  the irs issued guidance providing that  among other things  if a reit holds a regular interest in an eligible remic  or a residual interest in an eligible remic that informs the reit that at least of the remic s assets constitute real estate assets  then i the reit may treat of the value of the interest in the remic as a real estate asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests and ii the reit may treat of the gross income received with respect to the interest in the remic as interest on an obligation secured by a mortgage on real property for the purpose of the reit gross income test 
for this purpose  a remic is an eligible remic if i the remic has received a guarantee from fannie mae or freddie mac that will allow the remic to make any principal and interest payments on its regular and residual interests and ii all of the remic s mortgages and pass through certificates are secured by interests in single family dwellings which includes one t four family dwellings 
if we were to acquire an interest in an eligible remic less than of the assets of which constitute real estate assets  the irs guidance described above may generally allow us to treat of our interest in such a remic as a qualifying asset for the purpose of the reit asset tests and of the gross income derived from the interest as qualifying income for the purpose of the reit gross income test 
although the portion of the income from such a remic interest that does not qualify for the reit gross income test would likely be qualifying income for the purpose of the reit gross income test  the remaining of the remic interest generally would not qualify as a real estate asset  which could adversely affect our ability to satisfy the reit asset tests 
accordingly  owning such a remic interest could adversely affect our ability to qualify as a reit 
the taxable mortgage pool rules may increase the taxes that we or our stockholders may incur  and may limit the manner in which we effect future securitizations 
securitizations by us or our subsidiaries could result in the creation of taxable mortgage pools for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  we could have excess inclusion income 
certain categories of stockholders  such as non us stockholders eligible for treaty or other benefits  stockholders with net operating losses  and certain tax exempt stockholders that are subject to unrelated business income tax  could be subject to increased taxes on a portion of their dividend income from us that is attributable to any such excess inclusion income 
in the case of a stockholder that is a reit  a regulated investment company or  ric  common trust fund or other pass through entity  our allocable share of our excess inclusion income could be considered excess inclusion income of such entity 
in addition  to the extent that our common stock is owned by tax exempt disqualified organizations  such as certain government related entities and charitable remainder trusts that are not subject to tax on unrelated business income  we may incur a corporate level tax on a portion of any excess inclusion income 
because this tax generally would be imposed on us  all of our stockholders  including stockholders that are not disqualified organizations  generally will bear a portion of the tax cost associated with the classification of us or a portion of our assets as a taxable mortgage pool 
a ric  or other pass through entity owning our common stock in record name  will be subject to tax at the highest us federal corporate tax rate on any excess inclusion income allocated to their owners that are disqualified organizations 
moreover  we could face limitations in selling equity interests in these securitizations to outside investors  or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes 
finally  if we were to fail to qualify as a reit  any taxable mortgage pool securitizations would be treated as separate taxable corporations for us federal income tax purposes that could not be included in any consolidated us federal corporate income tax return 
historically  we have not generated excess inclusion  however  despite our efforts  we may not be able to avoid creating or distributing excess inclusion income to our stockholders in the future 
in addition  we could face limitations in selling equity interests to outside investors in securitization transactions that are taxable mortgage pools or selling any debt securities issued in connection with these securitizations that might be considered to be equity interests for tax purposes 
these limitations may prevent us from using certain techniques to maximize our returns from securitization transactions 
although our use of trss may be able to partially mitigate the impact of meeting the requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a reit  our ownership of and relationship with our trss is limited and a failure to comply with the limits would jeopardize our reit qualification and may result in the application of a excise tax if our transaction with a trs is not conducted on an arm s length basis 
a reit may own up to of the stock of one or more trss 
subject to certain exceptions  a trs may hold assets and earn income that would not be qualifying assets or income if held or earned directly by a reit 
both the subsidiary and the reit must jointly elect to treat the subsidiary as a trs 
a corporation of which a trs directly or indirectly owns more than of the voting power or value of the stock will automatically be treated as a trs 
overall  no more than of the value of a reit s total assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more trs 
in addition  the trs rules limit the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by a trs to its parent reit to assure that the trs is subject to an appropriate level of corporate taxation 
the rules also impose a excise tax on certain transactions between a trs and its parent reit that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
trss that we may form will pay us federal  state and local income or franchise tax on their taxable income  and their after tax net income will be available for distribution to us but will not be required to be distributed to us  unless necessary to maintain our reit qualification 
we will monitor the aggregate value of the securities of our trss and intend to conduct our affairs so that such securities will represent less than of the value of our total assets 
in addition  we will scrutinize our transactions with our trss to ensure that they are entered into on arm s length terms to avoid incurring the excise tax 
there can be no assurance however  that we will be able to comply with the trs limitation or avoid the excise tax in all situations 
dividends payable by reits generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates on dividend income from regular corporations  which could adversely affect the value of our common stock 
the maximum us federal income tax rate for certain qualified dividends payable to domestic stockholders that are individuals  trusts and estates is 
dividends payable by reits  however  are generally not eligible for the reduced rates and therefore may be subject to the maximum us federal income tax rate on ordinary income 
although the reduced us federal income tax rate applicable to dividend income from regular corporate dividends does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals  trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the shares of reits  including our shares 
complying with reit requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively 
the reit provisions of the internal revenue code may limit our ability to hedge our assets and operations 
under these provisions  any income that we generate from transactions intended to hedge our interest rate exposure will be excluded from gross income for purposes of the reit and gross income tests if the instrument hedges interest rate risk on liabilities used to carry or acquire real estate assets  or certain other specified types of risk  and such instrument is properly identified under applicable treasury regulations 
income from hedging transactions that do not meet these requirements will generally constitute non qualifying income for purposes of both the reit and gross income tests 
as a result of these rules  we may have to limit our use of hedging techniques that might otherwise be advantageous or implement those hedges through a trs 
this could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our trs would be subject to tax on gains or the limits on our use of hedging techniques could expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates than we would otherwise want to bear 
in addition  losses in our trs will generally not provide any tax benefit to us  although such losses may be carried forward to offset future taxable income of the trs 
the tax on prohibited transactions will limit our ability to engage in transactions  including certain methods of securitizing mortgage loans that would be treated as sales for us federal income tax purposes 
a reit s net income from prohibited transactions is subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property  other than foreclosure property  but including mortgage loans  held as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
we might be subject to this tax if we were to sell or securitize loans in a manner that was treated as a sale of the loans as inventory for us federal income tax purposes 
therefore  in order to avoid the prohibited transactions tax  we may choose not to engage in certain sales of loans  other than through a trs  and we may be required to limit the structures we use for our securitization transactions  even though such sales or structures might otherwise be beneficial for us 
we may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock 
at any time  the us federal income tax laws or regulations governing reits or the administrative interpretations of those laws or regulations may be changed  possibly with retroactive effect 
we cannot predict if or when any new us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  or any amendment to any existing us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation  will be adopted  promulgated or become effective or whether any such law  regulation or interpretation may take effect retroactively 
we and our stockholders could be adversely affected by any such change in  or any new  us federal income tax law  regulation or administrative interpretation 
liquidation of our assets may jeopardize our reit qualification 
to qualify as a reit  we must comply with requirements regarding our assets and our sources of income 
if we are compelled to liquidate our assets to repay obligations to our lenders  we may be unable to comply with these requirements  thereby jeopardizing our qualification as a reit  or we may be subject to a tax on any resultant gain if we sell assets that are treated as inventory or property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
our qualification as a reit and exemption from us federal income tax with respect to certain assets may be dependent on the accuracy of legal opinions or advice rendered or given or statements by the issuers of assets that we acquire  and the inaccuracy of any such opinions  advice or statements may adversely affect our reit qualification and result in significant corporate level tax 
when purchasing securities  we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel for the issuer of such securities  or statements made in related offering documents  for purposes of determining whether such securities represent debt or equity securities for us federal income tax purposes  and also to what extent those securities constitute reit real estate assets for purposes of the reit asset tests and produce income which qualifies under the reit gross income test 
in addition  when purchasing the equity tranche of a securitization  we may rely on opinions or advice of counsel regarding the qualification of the securitization for exemption from us corporate income tax and the qualification of interests in such securitization as debt for us federal income tax purposes 
the inaccuracy of any such opinions  advice or statements may adversely affect our reit qualification and result in significant corporate level tax 
our ability to invest in to be announced forward contracts could be limited by our reit qualification  and we could fail to qualify as a reit as a result of these investments 
we may purchase forward settling agency rmbs through to be announced forward contracts or  tbas 
pursuant to these tbas  we will agree to purchase  for future delivery  agency rmbs with certain principal and interest terms and certain types of underlying collateral  but the particular agency rmbs to be delivered is not identified until shortly before the tba settlement date 
as with any forward purchase contract  the value of the underlying agency rmbs may decrease between the contract date and the settlement date  which may result in the recognition of income or gains or loss 
the law is unclear regarding whether tbas are qualifying assets for the reit asset test 
accordingly  our ability to purchase agency rmbs through tbas or to dispose of tbas  through these transactions or otherwise  could be limited 
we do not expect tbas to comprise a significant portion of our assets and  therefore  do not expect tbas to adversely affect our ability to meet the reit assets tests 
no assurance can be given that the irs would treat tbas as qualifying assets 
in the event that such assets are determined to be non qualifying  we could be subject to a penalty tax or we could fail to qualify as a reit if the value of our tbas  together with our non qualifying assets for the asset test  exceeded of our total assets at the end of any calendar quarter or any income from the disposition of tbas exceeded of our gross income for any taxable year
