item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion and analysis contains certain statements that are not historical facts  including  among others  those relating to our anticipated financial performance for fiscal  cash requirements  and our expected store openings and preopening costs 
such statements are forward looking and speak only as of the date on which they are made 
actual results are subject to various risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  those discussed in item a of this k under risk factors 
information included in this discussion and analysis includes commentary on company owned and franchised restaurant units  restaurant sales  same store sales  and average weekly sales volumes 
management believes such sales information is an important measure of our performance  and is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of the buffalo wild wings grill bar concept and the overall health of the concept 
franchise information also provides an understanding of our revenues because franchise royalties and fees are based on the opening of franchised units and their sales 
however  franchise sales and same store sales information does not represent sales in accordance with u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may not be comparable to financial information as defined or used by other companies 
overview as of december   we owned and operated company owned and franchised an additional buffalo wild wings grill bar restaurants in north america 
we believe that we will grow the buffalo wild wings brand to about  locations in north america  continuing the strategy of developing both company owned and franchised restaurants 
we believe we will open company owned and franchised restaurants in and have set an annual net earnings growth goal of based on a week basis 
our growth and success depend on several factors and trends 
first  we will continue our focus on trends in company owned and franchised same store sales as an indicator of the continued acceptance of our concept by consumers 
we also review the overall trend in average weekly sales as an indicator of our ability to increase the sales volume and  therefore  cash flow per location 
we remain committed to high quality operations and guest experience 
our revenue is generated by sales at our company owned restaurants  which represented of total revenue in food and nonalcoholic beverages accounted for of restaurant sales 
the remaining of restaurant sales was from alcoholic beverages 
the menu items with the highest sales volumes are traditional and boneless wings at and  respectively  of total restaurant sales 
royalties and franchise fees received from our franchisees 
a second factor is our success in developing restaurants in new markets 
there are inherent risks in opening new restaurants  especially in new markets  including the lack of experience  logistical support  and brand awareness 
these factors may result in lower than anticipated sales and cash flow for restaurants in new markets along with higher preopening costs 
we believe our focus on our new restaurant opening procedures  along with our expanding north american presence  will help to mitigate the overall risk associated with opening restaurants in new markets 
third  we continue to monitor and react to changes in our cost of goods sold 
the costs of goods sold is difficult to predict  as it ranged from to of restaurant sales per quarter in and  mostly due to the price and yield fluctuation in chicken wings 
we work to counteract the volatility of chicken wing prices with the introduction of new menu items  marketing promotions  focused efforts on food costs and waste  and menu price increases 
we will continue to monitor the cost of chicken wings  as it can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow from company owned restaurants 
we continue to explore purchasing strategies to lessen the severity of cost increases and fluctuations  and are reviewing menu additions and other strategies that may decrease the volatility of our cost of sales percentage and decrease the percentage that chicken wings represent in terms of total restaurant sales 
current month chicken wing prices are determined based on the average of the previous month s spot rates 
the market price for traditional wings reached its lowest price in several years during the second quarter of the market price trended substantially higher toward the end of the chart below illustrates the fluctuation in chicken wing prices from quarter to quarter in the last five years 
we generate cash from the operation of our company owned restaurants and from franchise royalties and fees 
we highlight the specific costs associated with the on going operation of our company owned restaurants in the consolidated statement of earnings under restaurant operating costs 
nearly all of our depreciation expense relates to assets used by our company owned restaurants and amortization of reacquired franchise rights 
preopening costs are those costs associated with opening new company owned restaurants and will vary annually based on the number of new locations opening and under construction 
loss on asset disposals and store closures expense is related to company owned restaurants and includes the costs associated with closures of locations and normal asset retirements 
general and administrative expenses are related to home office and field support provided to both company owned restaurant and franchising operations 
we operate on a or week fiscal year ending on the last sunday in december 
each of the fiscal years in the four years ended december  were week years 
the fiscal year ended december  was a week year 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with gaap 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following discussion represents our more critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although it is not all inclusive 
valuation of long lived assets and store closing reserves we review long lived assets quarterly to determine if triggering events have occurred which would require a test to determine if the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is at the individual restaurant level 
in the absence of extraordinary circumstances  restaurants are included in the impairment analysis after they have been open for months 
we evaluate the recoverability of a restaurant s long lived assets  including intangibles  leasehold improvements  equipment and fixtures over the remaining life of the primary asset in the asset group  after considering the potential impact of planned operational improvements  marketing programs  and anticipated changes in the trade area 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of each restaurant over its remaining lease term 
if assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value based on our estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
no impairments were recognized in fiscal  or in addition to the valuation of long lived assets  we also record a store closing reserve when a restaurant is abandoned due to closure or relocation 
the store closing reserve is subject to significant judgment as accruals are made for lease obligations on abandoned leased facilities 
many factors  including the local business environment  other available lease sites  the willingness of lessors to negotiate lease buyouts  and the ability to sublease our sites are considered in making the accruals 
we estimate future lease obligations based on these factors and evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the estimated reserve based on current market conditions 
during   and  we recorded expenses of   and  respectively  for restaurants that closed 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually  or whenever circumstances change in a way which could indicate that impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
we identify potential goodwill impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  which includes goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the reporting unit is calculated using a market approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  this is an indication that impairment may exist 
we calculate the amount of the impairment by comparing the fair value of the assets and liabilities to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the value of the assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if this amount is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  impairment is recognized for the difference 
as of december   our estimate of the fair value of our goodwill substantially exceeded the carrying value and therefore we concluded that our goodwill was not impaired 
no goodwill impairment charges were recognized during   or vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances and other funds received from vendors 
certain of these funds are determined based on various quantitative contract terms 
we also receive vendor allowances from certain manufacturers and distributors calculated based upon purchases made by franchisees 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction of the related expense 
amounts that represent a reduction of inventory purchase costs are recorded as a reduction of inventoriable costs 
we record an estimate of earned vendor allowances that are calculated based upon monthly purchases 
we generally receive payment from vendors approximately days after the end of a month for that month s purchases 
during fiscal   and  vendor allowances were recorded as a reduction in inventoriable costs  and cost of sales was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively 
revenue recognition franchise operations our franchise agreements have terms ranging from to years 
these agreements also convey extension terms of or years depending on contract terms and if certain conditions are met 
we provide training  preopening assistance and restaurant operating assistance in exchange for area development fees  franchise fees and royalties of of the franchised restaurant s sales 
franchise fee revenue from individual franchise sales is recognized upon the opening of the restaurant when we have performed all of our material obligations and initial services 
area development fees are dependent upon the number of restaurants granted in the agreement as are our obligations under the area development agreement 
consequently  as our obligations are met  area development fees are recognized in relation to the expenses incurred with the opening of each new restaurant and any royalty free periods 
royalties are accrued as earned and are calculated each period based on reported franchisees sales 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  and employee health benefits 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims that may have arisen but have not yet been reported to us as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  and claims development history 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure for each of these programs 
significant judgment is required to estimate claims incurred but not reported as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the frequency or severity of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions  under which we use the black scholes merton pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected life of the options  expected volatility over the expected term  the risk free interest rate  and the expected forfeitures 
compensation expense for restricted stock units is recognized for the expected number of shares vesting at the end of each annual period 
restricted stock units granted in  and are subject to three year cliff vesting and a cumulative three year earnings target 
the number of units that vest is based on performance against the target 
stock based compensation is recognized for the expected number of shares vesting at the end of the three year period and is expensed over that period 
for these restricted stock unit grants  significant assumptions are made to estimate the expected net earnings levels for future years

liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity and capital requirements have been for constructing  remodeling and maintaining our new and existing company owned restaurants  working capital  acquisitions  and other general business needs 
we fund these expenses  except for acquisitions and emerging brands  primarily with cash from operations 
depending on the size of the transaction  acquisitions or investments in emerging brands would generally be funded from cash and marketable securities balances or using our line of credit 
the cash and marketable securities balance at december  was million 
we invest our cash balances in debt securities with the focus on protection of principal  adequate liquidity and return on investment based on risk 
as of december   nearly all excess cash was invested in high quality municipal securities and mutual funds 
during fiscal   and  net cash provided by operating activities was million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accrued expenses and decrease in refundable income taxes partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accrued expenses was primarily due to the timing of our bi weekly payroll 
the decrease in refundable income taxes was due to the timing of payments 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to an increase in credit card receivable due to the timing of the holidays near our fiscal year ends 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in the number of restaurants and the timing of payments 
the increase in accrued expenses was due to higher payroll related costs including incentive compensation and wages 
net cash provided by operating activities in consisted primarily of net earnings adjusted for non cash expenses and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in refundable income taxes and trading securities 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to an increase in the number of restaurants and the timing of payments 
the increase in refundable income taxes was due to benefits received from tax laws changed in late the increase in trading securities was due to additional contributions to and investment returns on our deferred compensation plan 
net cash used in investing activities for   and  was million  million  and million  respectively 
investing activities included acquisitions of property and equipment related to the additional company owned restaurants and restaurants under construction in all periods 
in   and  we opened or purchased   and restaurants  respectively 
in  we expect capital expenditures of approximately million for the cost of new or relocated company owned restaurants  million for technology improvements on our restaurant and corporate systems  and million for capital expenditures at existing restaurants

net cash provided by financing activities for resulted primarily from the issuance of common stock for options exercised and employee stock purchases of million and excess tax benefits from stock issuances of million partially offset by tax payments for restricted stock units of million 
no additional funding from the issuance of common stock other than from the exercise of options and employee stock purchases is anticipated in our liquidity is impacted by minimum cash payment commitments resulting from operating lease obligations for our restaurants and our corporate offices 
lease terms are generally to years with renewal options and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area maintenance and other operating costs 
some restaurant leases provide for contingent rental payments based on sales thresholds 
we own the buildings in which of our restaurants operate and therefore have the limited ability to enter into sale leaseback transactions as a potential source of cash 
the following table presents a summary of our contractual operating lease obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than one year years years after years operating lease obligations commitments for restaurants under development total we believe the cash flows from our operating activities and our balance of cash and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and building commitments and meet our obligations in the foreseeable future 
in february  to allow us to remain nimble for future investment in franchised acquisitions and emerging brands as we build the foundation for continued growth  we entered into a three year million unsecured revolving credit facility 
there is a commitment fee on the average unused portion of the facility at a rate per annum equal to  if our consolidated total leverage ratio is less than or equal to  or if our consolidated total leverage ratio is greater than or equal to 
our future cash outflows related to income tax uncertainties amount to  as of december  these amounts are excluded from the contractual obligations table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of these liabilities 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu intangibles goodwill and other topic testing indefinite lived assets for impairment 
asu gives companies the option to perform a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset 
under the guidance in asu  if this option is selected  a company is not required to calculate the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible unless the entity determines it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount 
the provisions of asu are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september   but early adoption is permitted 
we have elected not to early adopt the provisions of asu and do not expect asu to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation in the last three years we have not operated in a period of high general inflation  however  the cost of commodities  labor and certain utilities have generally increased or experienced price volatility 
our restaurant operations are subject to federal and state minimum wage laws governing such matters as working conditions  overtime and tip credits 
significant numbers of our food service and preparation personnel are paid at rates related to the federal and or state minimum wage and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage have increased our labor costs in the last three years 
in addition  costs associated with our operating leases  such as taxes  maintenance  repairs and insurance  are often subject to upward pressure 
to the extent permitted by competition  we have mitigated increased costs by increasing menu prices and may continue to do so if deemed necessary in future years 
quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth  by quarter  the unaudited quarterly results of operations for the two most recent years  as well as the same data expressed as a percentage of our total revenue for the periods presented 
restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the information for each quarter is unaudited and we have prepared it on the same basis as the audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results 
all amounts  except per share amounts  are expressed in thousands 
quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including increases or decreases in same store sales  changes in commodity prices  the timing and number of new restaurant openings and related preopening expenses  asset impairment charges  store closing charges  general economic conditions  stock based compensation  and seasonal fluctuations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to international market risk related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
we invest with a strategy focused on principal preservation 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we also have trading securities  which are held to generate returns that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to the equity market risk of our deferred compensation arrangements 
financial instruments financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of municipal securities 
we do not believe there is a significant risk of non performance by these municipalities because of our investment policy restrictions as to acceptable investment vehicles 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor  and restaurant operating costs 
substantial increases in these costs in any country that we operate in could impact operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along through higher menu prices 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable federal and state minimum wages  and increases in the minimum wage rates and tip credit wage rates could directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
commodity price risk many of the food products purchased by us are affected by weather  production  availability and other factors outside our control 
we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food product and supply risks 
we negotiate directly with independent suppliers for our supply of food and other products 
domestically  we use members of unipro food services  inc  a national cooperative of independent food distributors  to distribute these products from the suppliers to our restaurants 
we have signed a new distribution contract that covers food  paper  and non food products and began transitioning locations to the new provider in december with full rollout expected to be completed by june we have minimum purchase requirements with some of our vendors  but the terms of the contracts and nature of the products are such that our purchase requirements do not create a market risk 
the primary food product used by company owned and franchised restaurants is chicken wings 
we work to counteract the effect of the volatility of chicken wing prices  which can significantly change our cost of sales and cash flow  with the introduction of new menu items  effective marketing promotions  focused efforts on food costs and waste  and menu price increases 
we also explore purchasing strategies to reduce the severity of cost increases and fluctuations 
current month chicken wing prices are determined based on the average of the previous month s spot rates 
chicken wings accounted for approximately   and of our cost of sales in   and  respectively  with an annual average price per pound of   and  respectively 
a increase in traditional chicken wing costs during  would have increased restaurant cost of sales by approximately million for fiscal additional information related to chicken wing prices and our approaches to managing the volatility thereof is included in item under results of operations
