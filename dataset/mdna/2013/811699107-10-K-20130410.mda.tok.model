similarly  discussion of other matters in our consolidated financial statements refers to continuing operations unless otherwise indicated 
the results of the divested portions of our former broadcast servers and storage and media services businesses are reported in discontinued operations 
business overview we are a global leader in the delivery of multi screen video 
our products and services facilitate the aggregation  licensing  storage  management and distribution of video  television programming  and advertising content primarily to cable system operators and telecommunications companies 
during fiscal  our strategy was to transform the company into a software company  position ourselves to grow our revenues and streamline our operating cost structure 
we accomplished these objectives through the following actions we successfully divested two business segments that were non core to our strategy to allow us to focus solely on our software business while eliminating significant operating costs  we shifted our research and development resources from our declining legacy products to our next generation products and continue to invest and expand our current resources to our platform products adrenalin and nitro  advertising products infusion and adpulse and our in home gateway nucleus product 
we also announced numerous worldwide wins for these new products as we help our customers achieve their goals of reducing operating and capital costs as well as customer churn  we solidified our ongoing leadership of the company by appointing raghu rau as our permanent chief executive officer on may   we reduced the size of our accounting finance and manufacturing departments as well as the executive management team  and appointed new leadership in key positions  including the chief financial officer  chief accounting officer  general counsel  vp of engineering  vp of marketing  general manager of emea apac  general manager of americas sales  and a chief architect  we achieved significant non headcount cost savings throughout the organization  especially in the areas of outside legal and accounting costs as well as our general insurance plans  we are enhancing our business systems through an investment in a new cloud based erp crm system which is expected to go live in the second quarter of fiscal which will allow us to manage our business in real time and reduce our overall information technology costs  we are ensuring that we build quality into everything we do and are monitoring our results for continuous improvement  and we are executing and producing the financial and operational results that we as a management team have set out to achieve 
our focus in fiscal will be to grow our revenues as existing customers purchase or upgrade our next generation product offerings while also seeking out new customer opportunities  expand to new and adjacent markets such as mobile and internet protocol television iptv operators  increase our selling efforts into new geographical areas  and invest in new technologies through acquisition or direct investment 
we will also continue to review our overall cost structure as we continue to invest in our next generation products 
lastly  our key focus will be to continue to work closely with our customers and provide them with quality products and superior customer service as we help them achieve their business goals 
following the divesture of the broadcast servers and storage and media services businesses  our remaining businesses were organized into one reporting segment 
we will not report multiple business segments due to the nature of the products offered to customers  the market characteristics of each operating segment and our management structure 
we have experienced fluctuations in our revenues from quarter to quarter due to the following factors budgetary approvals by our customers for capital purchases  the ability of our customers to process the purchase order within their organization in a timely manner  availability of the product  the time required to deliver and install the product  and the customer s acceptance of the products and services 
in addition  many customers may delay or reduce capital expenditures 
this  together with other factors  could result in the reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  difficulties in collection of accounts receivable  excess and obsolete inventory  gross margin deterioration  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products  and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business  we expect movements in foreign exchange rates to have a greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the future 
results of operations the following discussion summarizes the key factors our management believes are necessary for an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
revenues the components of our total revenues are described in the following table for the fiscal years ended january  fy vs 
fy fy vs 
fy change change change change amounts in thousands  except for percentage data software revenues products     services     total revenues     cost of product revenues    cost of service revenues    inventory write down    total cost of revenues     gross profit     gross product profit margin gross service profit margin gross profit margin fiscal as compared to fiscal product revenues 
product revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  over fiscal  primarily due to the following a million decrease in back office platform revenue  which was primarily due to a million decrease in legacy product revenues to domestic customers 
included in this decrease is a million decrease relating to the revenue recorded from our subscription agreement with comcast from fiscal the agreement included specific product enhancements in fiscal and therefore was recorded as product revenues 
the current agreement with comcast signed in the second quarter of fiscal contains no specified product enhancements and therefore revenue recognized under this agreement was recorded as service revenue  and a million decrease in advertising revenues which was primarily due to lower license revenue from our legacy products of million offset by higher revenues from our newer products in fiscal of million 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in our in home gateway revenue which was due to a significant gateway licensing transaction with a customer in europe and higher legacy middleware product revenues resulting from the signing of an amendment with a european customer during the third quarter of fiscal  and a million increase in vod servers revenues during fiscal  as compared to the same period of fiscal  primarily due to a higher number of shipments of vod servers to north american customers in fiscal that was partially offset by lower revenues from a customer in asia 
service revenues 
service revenues for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a million increase in our in home revenues primarily due to a million increase in gateway service revenues from several domestic customers along with revenues from flashlight engineering and consulting  llc flashlight  which we acquired in june these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in legacy middleware service revenues which was a result of the recent amendment with a european customer which resulted in a higher portion of revenue recognized as product revenue  and a million increase in back office platform service revenue which was primarily due to the comcast agreement being recorded as service revenues  as mentioned above  along with increased service revenues from european customers due to a higher number of deployments this year 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in advertising service revenues due to lower product revenues of our legacy products 
for fiscal and  two customers each accounted for more than  and collectively accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately  or million  and  or million  of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
gross profit and margin 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses  and labor and overhead costs related to software development contracts 
our gross profit margin decreased approximately four percentage points for fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the following our gross product profit margin remained relatively stable for fiscal  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
higher product margins from our in home gateway products were due to significant license revenue recognized from a large european customer as well as higher legacy middleware license revenue as a result of the signing of an amendment with a european customer  as mentioned above 
in addition  we had higher product margins from our streaming business  which was a result of the restructuring of our manufacturing operations during fiscal these increases were offset by lower advertising license revenues which typically carry higher margins and a product mix of lower margins from reselling certain third party back office platform products 
for fiscal  our gross service profit margins decreased three percentage points from fiscal  primarily as a result of lower advertising and back office platform technical support revenues and lower legacy middleware service margins due to the signing of a new amendment  as mentioned above  and a million charge for inventory write downs incurred in fiscal due to lower foreseeable demand for some of our legacy product lines  in particular  hardware components related to certain discontinued vod server product lines  as we focus on selling the new products being developed 
we will continue to review our inventory levels and may record additional inventory write downs in future periods 
fiscal as compared to fiscal product revenues 
in fiscal  product revenues decreased to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
the million decrease in product revenues compared to fiscal was primarily due to decreased shipments of vod servers to north and south american customers of approximately million  a portion of middleware revenues from a european customer that were recorded as service revenues during the fiscal year ended january  totaling million  while recorded entirely as product revenue in the prior fiscal year 
in the prior fiscal year  the agreement with this european customer provided for licensing rights and specified enhancements to the software and therefore the associated revenues were classified as product revenues 
however  the agreement in the first quarter of fiscal provided for software licensing rights and software maintenance services  and was accordingly split between product and services revenues 
service revenues 
service revenues were relatively flat compared to fiscal service revenues increased million due to the reclassification of a portion of middleware revenues from a european customer from product revenues to service revenues as mentioned above  and we achieved higher service revenues from our in home gateway business 
this increase was offset due to fiscal service revenues having included million of maintenance revenues resulting from a deactivation of vod software and equipment by a us customer  and our comcast software subscription agreement extension being classified as service revenues for the period of february through may for fiscal  two customers each accounted for more than  and collectively accounted for 
for fiscal  three customers accounted for more than and collectively accounted for of our total revenues 
international products and service revenues accounted for approximately  or million  and  or million  of total revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
gross profit and margin 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses  and labor and overhead costs related to software development contracts

during fiscal  our total research and development expenses decreased by million as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower employee costs as our headcount decreased by employees in the vod server product line  which resulted in a million decrease in research and development expense  and by another employees in the philippines  which resulted in a million reduction in engineering costs relating to our legacy software products 
in addition  we had higher absorption of research and development reclassified to cost of sales of million as a result of higher in home gateway service revenues thatrequire greater customization work 
these decreases were substantially offset by an increase in outside contract labor costs which allowed us to more aggressively roll out our next generation product offerings in order to meet market demands 
fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal and  respectively  and decreased million from million to million year over year 
the year over year decrease is primarily due to lower domestic headcount related costs primarily related to our vod server and legacy middleware product lines

we expect to finalize our earn out costs during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we made cash earn out payments of million and anticipate paying out approximately million in cash in may  which will be the final cash earn out payments to both the eventis and the vividlogic shareholders 
fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal  we recorded earn out expenses of million for changes in contingent liabilities for estimated earn out payments that were to be made to the former shareholders of vividlogic and eventis to reflect estimated future financial performance and amounts earned in fiscal in accordance with the respective earn out criteria

fy fy vs 
fy change change change change amounts in thousands  except for percentage data income tax benefit provision    effective tax rate fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded income tax benefits of million on a loss before tax of million for fiscal primarily due to a tax benefit of million resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations and other reversals for uncertain tax positions in our foreign jurisdictions 
the statute of limitations varies by the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in any given year  statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions may lapse without examination and any uncertain tax position taken in these years will result in reduction of the liability for unrecognized tax benefits for that year 
we also generated a million tax benefit in the netherlands from qualifying innovative activities  innovation box 
earnings that qualify for the innovation box are taxed at a lower rate than the dutch statutory rate of 
we received a dutch tax ruling from the dutch authorities confirming that a portion of our earnings for the past three years is eligible for innovation box treatment 
we regularly review our tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating our unrecognized tax benefits 
we make adjustments to our unrecognized tax benefits when i facts and circumstance regarding a tax position change  causing a change in management s judgment regarding that tax position  ii a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority  and or iii the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position 
at january  we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the us net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets 
we will continue to assess the need for the valuation allowance at each balance sheet date based on all available evidence 
if we determine that we can realize some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reversed and a corresponding increase in net income would be recognized during the period

in any given year  the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions may lapse without examination and any uncertain tax positions taken in these years will result in a reduction of liability for unrecognized tax benefits for that year 
non gaap measures beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our reported non gaap measure of financial performance to both non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda 
we define non gaap income from operations as us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap operating income or loss plus stock based compensation expenses  amortization of intangible assets  inventory write downs  earn outs and change in fair value of earn outs  professional fees associated with acquisitions  divestitures  litigation and strategic alternatives and severance and other restructuring costs 
we define adjusted ebitda as us gaap operating income or loss before depreciation expense  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  inventory write downs  earn outs and change in fair value of earn outs  professional fees associated with acquisitions  divestitures  litigation and strategic alternatives  and severance and other restructuring costs 
we believe that non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda are both important measures that are not calculated according to us gaap 
we use non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda in internal forecasts and models when establishing internal operating budgets  supplementing the financial results and forecasts reported to our board of directors  determining a component of bonus compensation for executive officers and other key employees based on operating performance and evaluating short term and long term operating trends in our operations 
we believe that non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda financial measures assist in providing an enhanced understanding of our underlying operational measures to manage the business  to evaluate performance compared to prior periods and the marketplace  and to establish operational goals 
we believe that these non gaap financial adjustments are useful to investors because they allow investors to evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by management in our financial and operational decision making 
non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda are non gaap financial measures and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information provided in accordance with us gaap 
these non gaap financial measures may not be computed in the same manner as similarly titled measures used by other companies 
we expect to continue to incur expenses similar to the non gaap income from operations and adjusted ebitda financial adjustments described above  and investors should not infer from our presentation of this non gaap financial measure that these costs are unusual  infrequent or non recurring 
the following tables include the reconciliations of our us gaap income or loss from operations  the most directly comparable us gaap financial measure  to our non gaap income from operations and the reconciliation of our us gaap income or loss from operations to our adjusted ebitda for fiscal  and amounts in thousands  except per share and percentage data for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january  for the fiscal year ended january  gaap gaap gaap as reported adjustments non gaap as reported adjustments non gaap as reported adjustments non gaap revenues products    services    total revenues    cost of revenues products    services    amortization of intangible assets   stock based compensation inventory write down   total cost of revenues    gross profit     gross profit percentage operating expenses research and development    selling and marketing    general and administrative    amortization of intangible assets   stock based compensation expense   earn outs and change in fair value of earn outs   professional fees acquisitions  divestitures  litigation and strategic alternatives     severance and other restructuring costs   total operating expenses    loss income from operations    loss income from operations percentage weighted average common shares outstanding basic      diluted      non gaap operating loss income per share basic diluted adjusted ebitda loss income from operations  depreciation expense  amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation expense  earn outs and changes in fair value  professional fees acquisitions  divestitures  etc 
inventory write down  severance and other restructuring  adjusted ebitda   adjusted ebitda we have revised our calculation of adjusted ebitda for fiscal furnished to the sec in our form k dated december  for the correction of an error in depreciation expense 
specifically  the calculation of adjusted ebitda we provided on december  overstated depreciation expense by million which was related to discontinued operations 
the effect of this revision has no impact on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss for fiscal or fiscal the consolidated statements of cash flows have been adjusted for discontinued operations 
see the table below for details on the error amounts in thousands for the fiscal year ended for the fiscal year ended january  january  as furnished revision as revised depreciation expense    in managing and reviewing our business performance  we exclude a number of items required by us gaap 
management believes that excluding these items is useful in understanding the trends and managing our operations 
we provide these supplemental non gaap measures in order to assist the investment community to see seachange through the eyes of management  and therefore enhance the understanding of seachange s operating performance 
non gaap financial measures should be viewed in addition to  not as an alternative to  our reported results prepared in accordance with us gaap 
our non gaap financial measures reflect adjustments based on the following items amortization of intangible assets 
we incur amortization expense of intangible assets related to various acquisitions that have been made in recent years 
these intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition  are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by management after the acquisition 
we believe that exclusion of these expenses allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent over time for the company s newly acquired and long held businesses 
stock based compensation expense 
we incur expenses related to stock based compensation included in our us gaap presentation of cost of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense and research and development expense 
although stock based compensation is an expense we incur and is viewed as a form of compensation  the expense varies in amount from period to period  and is affected by market forces that are difficult to predict and are not within the control of management  such as the market price and volatility of our shares  risk free interest rates and the expected term and forfeiture rates of the awards 
inventory write down 
we incur inventory write downs of our legacy product lines as we end the life of certain product lines to focus on selling the new products being developed 
earn outs and change in fair value of earn outs 
earn outs and the change in the fair value of the earn outs are considered by management to be non recurring expenses to the former shareholders of the businesses we acquire 
we also incur expense due to changes in fair value related to contingent consideration that we believe would otherwise impair comparability among periods 
professional fees acquisitions  divestitures  litigation  and strategic alternatives 
we have excluded the effect of legal professional costs associated with our acquisitions  divestitures  litigation and strategic alternatives because the amount and timing of the expenses are largely non recurring 
severance and other restructuring 
we incurred charges due to the restructuring of our business  including severance charges and facility reductions resulting from our restructuring and streamlining efforts and any changes due to revised estimates  which we generally would not have otherwise incurred in the periods presented as part of our continuing operations 
we also incurred charges for the hiring and appointment of the chief executive officer 
depreciation expense 
we incur depreciation expense related to capital assets purchased to support the ongoing operations of the business 
these assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over the useful life of the asset 
purchases of such assets may vary significantly from period to period and without any correlation to underlying operating performance 
management believes that exclusion of depreciation expense allows comparisons of operating results that are consistent across past  present and future periods

cash  restricted cash and marketable securities increased from million at january  to million at january  the increase in our cash and marketable securities of million was primarily due to the proceeds from the sale of the broadcast servers and storage and media service businesses  which resulted in us receiving total net proceeds of million  and non cash expenses of million 
these proceeds were primarily offset by a use of cash from our net losses of million  changes in operating assets and liabilities of million  capital expenditures of million  earn out payments of million and the purchase of million of stock under a share repurchase program 
at the end of fiscal  our cash and marketable securities balance was million  or a million increase over the balance at january  the increase was primarily related to cash generated from operations 
our working capital also increased million to million at january  from million at january  we believe that existing funds combined with available borrowings under our new demand note payable and cash provided by future operating activities are adequate to satisfy our working capital  potential acquisitions  capital expenditure requirements and other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future  including at least the next months 
given our cash and marketable securities and working capital balances  we believe that repatriation of cash from outside the united states will not be a material factor for us

debt instruments and related covenants our million revolving line of credit with rbs citizens a subsidiary of the royal bank of scotland group plc rbs citizens expired on october  on november   we entered into a letter agreement with jp morgan chase bank  na jp morgan for a demand discretionary line of credit and a demand promissory note in the aggregate amount of million the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit will be used to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
the line of credit expires on november  we currently do not have any borrowings nor are there any financial covenants under this line 
contractual obligations the following table reflects our current and contingent contractual obligations to make potential future payments as of january  less than one to three to over five total one year three years five years years amounts in thousands purchase obligations   non cancelable lease obligations    contingent consideration   total    the purchase obligations include open  non cancelable purchase commitments from our suppliers 
we have excluded from the table above uncertain tax liabilities as defined by authoritative guidance due to the uncertainty of the amount and period of payment 
as of january   we have gross unrecognized tax benefits of million 
on september   we completed the acquisition of eventis from a holding company in which erwin van dommelen  who was employed by us from march to september  had a interest in the holding company 
under the terms of the definitive agreement  we paid million upon the closing of the transaction on september  in addition  we were obligated to pay million approximately million in cash to the former eventis shareholders on each of the first three anniversary dates following the acquisition 
we were also obligated on each of the aforementioned anniversary dates to issue shares of restricted stock of seachange equating to million approximately million annually to the former eventis shareholders 
the purchase price also included a performance based component principally related to the achievement of certain annual revenue targets for eventis and seachange products and services 
the revenue performance metrics cover the three year period ending january  with payment upon achievement of these metrics occurring annually 
we have made cash payments to date to the holding company of approximately million and issued approximately  restricted common shares 
on september   we amended the eventis share purchase agreement with the holding company and as a result  we will accelerate approximately  restricted shares on september  the amendment did not change the total amount of payments payable under the purchase agreement 
we estimate earn out payments will be made during the first half of fiscal for amounts earned based on the respective earn out criteria 
under the share purchase agreement with the former shareholders of vividlogic  we were obligated to make a fixed payment of million on february  which was paid on february  additional earn out payments may be earned for the year ending january   if certain performance goals are met 
we estimate earn out payments will be made in the first half of fiscal for amounts earned based on the respective earn out criteria 
we are occasionally required to post customer performance bonds  issued by a financial institution  to secure certain sales contracts 
customer performance bonds generally authorize the financial institution to make a payment to the beneficiary upon the satisfaction of a certain event or the failure to satisfy an obligation 
the customer performance bonds are generally posted for one year terms and are usually automatically renewed upon maturity until such time as we have satisfied the commitment secured by the customer performance bond 
we are obligated to reimburse the issuer only if the beneficiary collects on the customer performance bond 
we currently have a customer performance bond outstanding totaling million which was previously secured under the rbs citizens line of credit 
we are holding million in restricted cash with rbs citizens on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  to cover this outstanding customer performance bond until this performance bond is transferred under the jp morgan demand line 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements set forth in part ii  item of this form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates  judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
principles of consolidation we consolidate the financial statements of our wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
we also hold minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
we evaluate our equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines regarding the consolidation of variable interest entities vie should be applied in the financial statements 
consolidation guidelines address consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the vie 
we have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  our investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  our proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
revenue recognition our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from these activities is deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed 
revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support agreements is recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract 
accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed 
revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of intercompany profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies are eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership 
we have historically applied the software revenue recognition rules as prescribed by accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update number asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  which amended asc this asu removes tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
in the case of our hardware products with embedded software  we have determined that the hardware and software components function together to deliver the product s essential functionality  and therefore  the revenue from the sale of these products no longer falls within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
revenue from the sale of software only products remains within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules 
maintenance and support  training  consulting  and installation services no longer fall within the scope of the software revenue recognition rules  except when they are sold with and relate to a software only product 
revenue recognition for products that no longer fall under the scope of the software revenue recognition rules are similar to that for other tangible products and asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which amended asc and was also issued in october  which is applicable for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu allows companies to allocate revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement in a manner that better reflects the transaction s economics 
asu and asu are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in our fiscal year and thereafter 
under the software revenue recognition rules  the fee is allocated to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
where fair value of undelivered service elements has not been established  the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services are performed 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include project management  training  installation  maintenance and technical support and certain hardware and software components  are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and project management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
these services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification or customization and systems sales where vsoe of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support  percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support 
all multiple deliverable revenue arrangements negotiated prior to february  and the sale of all software only products and associated services have been accounted for under this guidance 
under the revenue recognition rules for tangible products as amended by asu  the fee from a multiple deliverable arrangement is allocated to each of the deliverables based upon their relative selling prices as determined by a selling price hierarchy 
a deliverable in an arrangement qualifies as a separate unit of accounting if the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
a delivered item that does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting is combined with the other undelivered items in the arrangement and revenue is recognized for those combined deliverables as a single unit of accounting 
the selling price used for each deliverable is based upon vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  and best estimate of selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe are available 
tpe is the price of the company s  or any competitor s  largely interchangeable products or services in stand alone sales to similarly situated customers 
besp is the price at which we would sell the deliverable if it were sold regularly on a stand alone basis  considering market conditions and entity specific factors 
all multiple deliverable revenue arrangements negotiated after february   excluding the sale of all software only products and associated services  have been accounted for under this guidance 
the selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method for certain of our services are based upon vsoe 
the selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method for third party products from other vendors are based upon tpe 
the selling prices used in the relative selling price allocation method for our hardware products  software  subscriptions  and customized services for which vsoe does not exist are based upon besp 
we do not believe tpe exists for these products and services because they are differentiated from competing products and services in terms of functionality and performance and there are no competing products or services that are largely interchangeable 
management establishes besp with consideration for market conditions  such as the impact of competition and geographic considerations  and entity specific factors  such as the cost of the product  discounts provided and profit objectives 
management believes that besp is reflective of reasonable pricing of that deliverable as if priced on a stand alone basis 
allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue for products and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally do not require collateral 
for some international customers  we may require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
we monitor payments from customers and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for specific doubtful accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and record these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
we base our allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements we measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available  which may include quoted market prices  market comparables and discounted cash flow projections 
financial instruments include money market funds  corporate debt investments  asset backed securities  government sponsored enterprises and state municipal obligations 
in general  and where applicable  we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value 
if quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value  then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
inventories and reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of our hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
the value of inventories is reviewed quarterly to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
we record charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when impairment is identified through the quarterly review process 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for the years ended january   and  we recorded million  million and million in inventory write downs  respectively 
accounting for business combinations in our business combinations  we are required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
the purchase price allocation process requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially at acquisition date with respect to intangible assets  estimated contingent consideration payments and pre acquisition contingencies 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made have been reasonable and appropriate  they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired company and are inherently uncertain 
examples of critical estimates in accounting for acquisitions include but are not limited to the estimated fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration  which is calculated using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model based upon the forecasted achievement of post acquisition bookings targets  the future expected cash flows from product sales  support agreements  consulting contracts  other customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  and the relevant discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
additionally  any change in the fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration subsequent to the acquisition date  including changes from events after the acquisition date  such as changes in our estimate of the bookings that are expected to be achieved  will be recognized in earnings in the period of the estimated fair value change 
a change in fair value of the acquisition related contingent consideration could have a material effect on the statement of operations and financial position in the period of the change in estimate 
acquired intangible assets and goodwill acquired intangible assets we use significant judgment in determining the fair value of acquired intangible assets  whether the assets are amortizable or non amortizable and the period and method by which the intangible asset will be amortized 
intangible assets completed technology  licensing agreements  non compete agreements and customer relationships 
acquired intangible assets are reported at cost  net of accumulated amortization and are either amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives during the period the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
we review definite lived intangible assets for impairment when indication of a potential impairment exists 
goodwill goodwill is the amount by which the cost of the acquired net assets in a business acquisition exceeded the fair values of the net identifiable assets on the date of purchase 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment annually  in our third quarter beginning august st 
goodwill may be tested for impairment on an interim basis  in addition to the annual evaluation  if an event occurs or circumstances change which would more likely than not reduce our fair value below our carrying amount  indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired 
we test goodwill for impairment by evaluating our fair value compared to the book value 
if the book value of the company exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess long lived assets we review property and equipment  investments and other long lived assets on a regular basis for impairment when indication of potential impairment exists 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compare that value to the carrying value of the assets 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
with the divestiture of our broadcast servers and storage business  we determined we would no longer utilize our facility in new hampshire as an active operation and have placed the building on the market for sale 
we originally placed it on the market for million 
to be more competitive in the real estate market in which the property is located  we reduced the selling price in fiscal to million 
as a result  we recorded a million restructuring charge to reduce the carrying value of this building 
software development costs we develop software for resale in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
the time period during which software development costs can be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short  and consequently  the amounts are not capitalized because they are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
software development costs relating to sales of software requiring significant modification or customization are charged to costs of product revenues 
we also purchase software for resale and capitalize those costs associated with projects that meet technological feasibility 
amortization expense is recorded over the period of economic consumption or the life of the agreement  whichever results in the higher expense  starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
amortization expense of capitalized software is recorded over the period of economic consumption or the life of the agreement  whichever results in the higher expense  starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
amortization expense of capitalized software was million  million and approximately  for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  we accelerated amortization totaling million of purchased software resulting from discontinued use 
in addition  as a result of the divestiture of the broadcast servers and storage business and our restructuring  in fiscal we recorded an impairment charge to restructuring expenses of million for purchased software that will no longer be used 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax provision  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
we do not provide for us federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside the united states 
authoritative guidance as it relates to income tax liabilities states that the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than 
the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
we file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves as well as the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
the changes in estimate could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results 
in addition  settlement of any particular position could have a material and adverse effect on our cash flows and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for all employee and non employee director stock based compensation awards using the authoritative guidance regarding share based payments 
we continue to use the black scholes pricing model as we feel it is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of the majority of applicable awards 
we also use the monte carlo pricing model for our market based option awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the estimated fair value of our stock based options and performance based restricted stock units rsus  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis  whereas the rsus are amortized on a straight line basis 
foreign currency translation for subsidiaries where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency of the entity  we translate that entity s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies into us dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates  as of each balance sheet date 
non monetary assets eg  inventories  property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts eg  cost of sales  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency the us dollar and the local currency 
revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal period 
translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and any unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
for subsidiaries where the local currency is designated as the functional currency  we translate the subsidiaries assets and liabilities into us dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date 
revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
the aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses included as other expense  net  on the consolidated statement of operations was approximately  million and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
recent accounting standard updates impact of recently adopted accounting guidance goodwill impairment test in september  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing goodwill for impairment  which provided additional guidance on the annual and interim goodwill impairment testing 
the guidance became effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal this guidance provides entities with an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if it is determined  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  the two step goodwill impairment test will be required 
the adoption of this update had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  for further information on the company s annual impairment tests 
fair value measurements in may  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurement amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrs  which amended previous guidance clarifying how to measure and disclose fair value 
the guidance became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal the update amends the application of the highest and best use concept to be used only in the measurement of the fair value of nonfinancial assets  clarifies that the measurement of the fair value of equity classified financial instruments should be performed from the perspective of a market participant who holds the instrument as an asset  clarifies that an entity that manages a group of financial assets and liabilities on the basis of its net risk exposure to those risks can measure those financial instruments on the basis of its net exposure to those risks  and clarifies when premiums and discounts should be taken into account when measuring fair value 
this guidance results in a consistent definition of fair value and common requirements for the measurement of and disclosure about fair value between international financial reporting standards ifrs and us gaap 
the guidance also changes some fair value measurement principles and enhances disclosure requirements related to activities in level of the fair value hierarchy 
besides a change in disclosure requirements  the adoption of this update had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting guidance not yet effective amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in february  the fasb issued asu  reporting of amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income  this update requires us to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
in addition  we are required to present  either on the face of the consolidated financial statements or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required to be reclassified in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for amounts that are not required to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  we are required to cross reference to other disclosures that provide additional details about these amounts 
this update is effective prospectively for our fiscal and early adoption is permitted 
besides changes to disclosures  we do not expect the adoption of this update to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
balance sheet offsetting in january  the fasb issued asu  balance sheet topic clarifying the scope of disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities  which amends previous guidance on the disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities on the balance sheet to clarify that the scope of this guidance applies to derivatives including bifurcated embedded derivatives  repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions that are offset or subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement or similar agreement 
the guidance becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal and should be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
indefinite lived intangible assets in july  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment  which amends previous guidance on the annual and interim testing of indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the guidance becomes effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  although early adoption is permitted 
the update provides entities with the option of first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more than likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount 
if it is determined  on the basis of qualitative factors  that the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount  a quantitative impairment test would still be required 
we perform annual impairment tests as of august st of each fiscal year 
the adoption of this update is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our foreign currency exchange exposure is primarily associated with product sales arrangements or settlement of intercompany payables and receivables among subsidiaries and their respective parent company  and or investment equity contingency considerations denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar 
substantially all of our international product sales are payable in us dollars or in the case of our eventis operations in the netherlands  payable in local currencies  providing a natural hedge for receipts and local payments 
in light of the high proportion of our international businesses  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have an impact on our translated results within the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
in addition  for the year ended january   we generated a foreign currency translation gain of million  million of which was related to the disposition of retained currency translation losses related to the divestitures of our broadcast servers and media services businesses 
we recorded this gain in accumulated other comprehensive loss  increasing the equity section of the balance sheet 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and do not currently have outstanding derivative financial instruments related to payment obligations of the company 
while we do not anticipate that near term changes in exchange rates will have a material impact on our operating results  financial position and liquidity  a sudden and significant change in the value of foreign currencies could harm our operating results  financial position and liquidity 
the us dollar is the functional currency for a majority of our international subsidiaries 
all foreign currency gains and losses are included in interest and other income  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income loss 
in fiscal year  we recorded approximately  in losses due to international subsidiary translations and cash settlements of revenues and expenses 
interest rate risk exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable debt securities of various issuers  types and maturities and to our borrowings under our demand note payable 
we do not use derivative instruments in our investment portfolio  and our investment portfolio only includes highly liquid instruments 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of nine months or less 
there is risk that losses could be incurred if we were to sell any of its securities prior to stated maturity 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable securities  which are carried at the lower of cost or market  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are subject to changes in fair value 
at january   we had million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities
