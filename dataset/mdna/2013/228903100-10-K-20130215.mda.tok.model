item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview cryolife  inc cryolife  the company  we  or us  incorporated in in florida  preserves and distributes human tissues for transplantation and develops  manufactures  and commercializes medical devices for cardiac and vascular applications 
the cardiac and vascular human tissues distributed by cryolife include the cryovalve sg pulmonary heart valve cryovalve sgpv and the cryopatch sg pulmonary cardiac patch tissue cryopatch sg  both processed using cryolife s proprietary synergraft technology 
cryolife s surgical sealants and hemostats include bioglue surgical adhesive bioglue  biofoam surgical matrix biofoam  and perclot  an absorbable powdered hemostat  which the company distributes for starch medical  inc smi in the european community and other select international markets 
cryolife s subsidiary  cardiogenesis corporation cardiogenesis  specializes in the treatment of coronary artery disease using a laser console system and single use  fiber optic handpieces to treat patients with severe angina 
cryolife and its subsidiary  hemosphere  inc hemosphere  market the hemodialysis reliable outflow graft hero graft  which is a solution for end stage renal disease in certain hemodialysis patients 
for the year ended december  cryolife had record annual revenues of million 
during cryolife reported its highest revenues ever for a first  second  third  and fourth quarter  with each quarter exceeding million in revenues 
the company s acquisition of hemosphere in may coupled with its acquisition of cardiogenesis in may continued to add revenue generating product lines to the company s existing tissue services and products portfolio 
the company also reported new record annual revenues for its vascular preservation services and bioglue 
the company s cash position was strong as the company generated million in cash flows from operations during this cash was used to fund the company s acquisition of hemosphere  the common stock buyback  and the per share quarterly cash dividend that the company initiated in the third quarter of the company experienced increases in selling  general  and administrative expenses during due to increased spending on business development activities and additional general  administrative  and marketing costs related to the company s recent acquisitions of hemosphere and cardiogenesis 
see the results of operations section below for additional analysis of the fourth quarter and full year results 
see part i  item  business  for further discussion of the company s business and activities during recent events on january  cryolife received a warning letter warning letter dated january  from the us food and drug administration fda 
the warning letter followed a form  notice of inspectional observations from the fda form related to the company s processing  preservation  and distribution of human tissue and the manufacture of medical devices 
the form followed a routine quality system inspection of the company s facilities by the fda during the period september  to october  the warning letter relates to certain observations from the form that the fda believes were either inadequately addressed by the company s responses or for which the fda required further information to fully assess the company s corrective actions 
the company intends to respond fully to the fda s requests and believes that it will be able to address the fda s notice of violations contained in the warning letter  however  it is possible that the company may not be able to do so in a manner satisfactory to the fda 
the company believes that the warning letter and its actions regarding the warning letter and form will not have a material impact on the company 
however  it is possible that actions it may be required to take in response to the form and warning letter could materially  adversely impact the availability of the company s tissues and products and cost structure  which could impact the company s revenues  financial condition  profitability  or cash flows 
see also part i  item a  risk factors critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in part ii  item  note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
fair value measurements the company records certain financial instruments at fair value  including cash equivalents  certain marketable securities  certain restricted securities  contingent consideration  and derivative instruments 
the company may make an irrevocable election to measure other financial instruments at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis  although as of december  the company has not chosen to make any such elections 
fair value financial instruments are recorded in accordance with the fair value measurement framework 
the company also measures certain non financial assets at fair value on a non recurring basis 
these non recurring valuations include evaluating assets such as cost method investments  long lived assets  and non amortizing intangible assets for impairment  allocating value to assets in an acquired asset group  and applying accounting for business combinations 
the company uses the fair value measurement framework to value these assets and reports these fair values in the periods in which they are recorded or written down 
the fair value measurement framework includes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair values in their broad levels 
these levels from highest to lowest priority are as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities  level quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities or observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets  but corroborated by market data  and level unobservable inputs or valuation techniques that are used when little or no market data is available 
the determination of fair value and the assessment of a measurement s placement within the hierarchy requires judgment 
level valuations often involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
level valuations may require the use of various cost  market  or income valuation methodologies applied to unobservable management estimates and assumptions 
management s assumptions could vary depending on the asset or liability valued and the valuation method used 
such assumptions could include estimates of prices  earnings  costs  actions of market participants  market factors  or the weighting of various valuation methods 
the company may also engage external advisors to assist it in determining fair value  as appropriate 
although the company believes that the recorded fair value of its financial instruments is appropriate  these fair values may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values 
deferred preservation costs by federal law  human tissues cannot be bought or sold  therefore  the tissues the company preserves are not held as inventory 
the costs the company incurs to procure and process cardiac and vascular tissues are accumulated and deferred 
deferred preservation costs are stated at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out basis and are deferred until revenue is recognized 
upon shipment of the tissue to an implanting facility  revenue is recognized and the related deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services 
cost of preservation services also includes  as applicable  lower of cost or market write downs and impairments for tissues not deemed to be recoverable  and includes  as incurred  idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  extra freight  and rehandling costs 
the calculation of deferred preservation costs involves judgment and complexity and uses the same principles as inventory costing 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by tissue banks and organ procurement organizations otpos  which consign the tissue to the company for processing  preservation  and distribution 
deferred preservation costs consist primarily of the procurement fees charged by the otpos  direct labor and materials including salary and fringe benefits  laboratory supplies and expenses  and freight in charges and indirect costs including allocations of costs from support departments and facility allocations 
fixed production overhead costs are allocated based on actual tissue processing levels  to the extent that they are within the range of the facility s normal capacity 
total deferred preservation costs are then allocated among tissues processed during the period based on cost drivers  such as the number of donors or number of tissues processed 
at each balance sheet date  a portion of the deferred preservation costs relates to tissues currently in active processing or held in quarantine pending release to implantable status 
the company applies a yield estimate to all tissues in process and in quarantine to estimate the portion of tissues that will ultimately become implantable 
management estimates quarantine yields based on its experience and reevaluates these estimates periodically 
actual yields could differ significantly from the company s estimates  which could result in a change in tissues available for shipment  and could increase or decrease the balance of deferred preservation costs 
these changes could result in additional cost of preservation services expense or could increase per tissue preservation costs  which would impact gross margins on tissue preservation services in future periods 
the company regularly evaluates its deferred preservation costs to determine if the costs are appropriately recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
the company also evaluates its deferred preservation costs for costs not deemed to be recoverable  including tissues not expected to ship prior to the expiration date of their packaging 
lower of cost or market value write downs are recorded if the tissue processing costs incurred exceed the estimated market value of the tissue services  based on recent average service fees at the time of the evaluation 
impairment write downs are recorded based on the book value of tissues deemed to be impaired 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
write downs of deferred preservation costs are expensed as cost of preservation services  and these write downs are permanent impairments that create a new cost basis  which cannot be restored to its previous levels if the company s estimates change 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and tax return purposes 
the company periodically assesses the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
management provides a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset when  as a result of this analysis  management believes it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets involves judgment and complexity 
estimates and judgments used in the determination of the need for a valuation allowance and in calculating the amount of a needed valuation allowance include  but are not limited to  the following projected future operating results  anticipated future state tax apportionment  timing and amounts of anticipated future taxable income  timing of the anticipated reversal of book tax temporary differences  evaluation of statutory limits regarding usage of certain tax assets  and evaluation of the statutory periods over which certain tax assets can be utilized 
significant changes in the factors above  or other factors  could materially  adversely impact the company s ability to use its deferred tax assets 
such changes could have a material  adverse impact on the company s operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
the company will continue to assess the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  as necessary  when the company experiences changes that could materially affect its prior determination of the recoverability of its deferred tax assets 
the company believes that the realizability of its acquired net operating loss carryforwards will be limited in future periods due to a change in control of its subsidiaries hemosphere and cardiogenesis  as mandated by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company believes that its acquisition of hemosphere constituted a change in control and that prior to the company s acquisition  hemosphere had experienced other equity ownership changes that should be considered a change in control 
the company also believes that its acquisition of cardiogenesis constituted a change in control 
the deferred tax assets recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets do not include amounts that it expects will not be realizable due to these changes in control 
a portion of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards is related to state income taxes and can only be used by the company s subsidiaries hemosphere and cardiogenesis 
due to the history of losses of these subsidiaries when operated as stand alone companies  management believes it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
therefore  the company recorded a valuation allowance against these state net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s tax years through generally remain open to examination by the major taxing jurisdictions to which the company is subject 
however  certain returns from years prior to  in which net operating losses and tax credits have arisen  are still open for examination by the tax authorities 
valuation of acquired assets or businesses as part of its corporate strategy  the company is seeking to identify and evaluate acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies 
the company evaluates and accounts for acquired patents  licenses  distribution rights  and other tangible or intangible assets as the purchase of an asset or asset group  or as a business combination  as appropriate 
the determination of whether the purchase of a group of assets should be accounted for as an asset group or as a business combination requires significant judgment based on the weight of available evidence 
for the purchase of an asset group  the company allocates the cost of the asset group  including transaction costs  to the individual assets purchased based on their relative estimated fair values 
in process research and development acquired as part of an asset group is expensed upon acquisition 
the company accounts for business combinations by allocating the purchase price to the assets and liabilities acquired at their estimated fair value 
transaction costs related to a business combination are expensed as incurred 
in process research and development acquired as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the related research and development project gains regulatory approval or is discontinued 
the company engages external advisors to assist it in determining the fair value of acquired asset groups or business combinations  using cost  market  or income valuation methodologies  as appropriate  including the excess earnings  the discounted cash flow  or the relief from royalty methods 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgments and estimates  including  but not limited to timing of product life cycles  estimates of future revenues  estimates of profitability for new or acquired products  cost estimates for new or changed manufacturing processes  estimates of the cost or timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  estimates of the success of competitive products  and discount rates 
management  in consultation with its advisor s  makes these estimates based on its prior experiences and industry knowledge 
management believes that its estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ significantly from the company s estimates 
a significant change in management s estimates used to value acquired asset groups could result in future write downs of tangible or intangible assets acquired by the company and  therefore  could materially impact the company s financial position and profitability 
if the value of the liabilities assumed by the company  including contingent liabilities  is determined to be significantly different from the amounts previously recorded in purchase accounting  the company may need to record additional expenses or write downs in future periods  which could materially impact the company s financial position and profitability 
new accounting pronouncements in january the company adopted accounting standards update asu  fair value measurement topic amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap and ifrss  which clarifies some existing concepts and expands the disclosures for fair value measurements that are estimated using significant unobservable level inputs 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
in january the company adopted asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  and asu related to presentation of comprehensive income in interim and annual financial statements 
in january the company adopted asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing goodwill for impairment  which gives entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit in step of the goodwill impairment test 
the adoption of asu did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  profitability  and cash flows 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the three months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the three months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase revascularization technologies hero graft total products other total revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues as a percentage of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  preservation services cardiac tissue vascular tissue total preservation services products bioglue and biofoam perclot hemostase revascularization technologies hero graft total products other total revenues increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
preservation services revenues from preservation services increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac preservation services revenues 
see further discussion of cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services consisting of revenues from the distribution of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by  and by the aggregate impact of an increase in volume and tissue mix  which increased revenues by 
revenues from cardiac preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to the aggregate impact of an increase in volume and tissue mix  which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in revenues from volume and tissue mix for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac patch shipments  partially offset by a decrease in shipments of pulmonary valves  and the increase for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in cardiac valve shipments 
changes in unit shipments of cardiac valves and patches in any one quarter can be impacted by the timing of release of these tissues for shipment  which can vary from quarter to quarter 
the company believes that the increase in unit shipments of cardiac valves for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the activities of its expanded cardiac sales staff and the company s ongoing physician education activities  and may have also benefited from the guidance issued by the society of thoracic surgeons  which indicates that human aortic valves are the ideal replacement in certain cardiac reconstructive procedures involving endocarditis 
the company s cardiac valves are primarily used in cardiac replacement and reconstruction surgeries for patients with congenital heart defects 
revenues from synergraft processed tissues  including the cryovalve sgpv and cryopatch sg  accounted for and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for of total cardiac preservation services revenues for both the three and twelve months ended december   and and of total cardiac preservation services revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
vascular preservation services revenues from vascular preservation services for the three months ended december  were comparable to revenues for the three months ended december  revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by  partially offset by a decrease in average service fees  which decreased revenues by 
the increase in vascular tissue volume for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins and aortoiliac grafts  which increased due to improved availability of certain tissues 
saphenous veins are primarily used in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations  and aortoiliac grafts are primarily used in surgeries to treat abdominal aortic aneurisms 
these tissues are primarily distributed in domestic markets 
the decrease in average service fees for the twelve months ended december  was due in part to a list fee decrease for certain vascular tissues in and fee differences due to physical characteristics of vascular tissues  partially offset by the routine negotiation of pricing contracts with certain customers 
products revenues from products increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the increase for the three months ended december  was primarily due to the addition of hero graft revenues as a result of the company s acquisition of hemosphere in the second quarter of  and an increase in bioglue revenues 
the increase for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in bioglue revenues  the addition of hero graft revenues  and an increase in revascularization technologies revenues as a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in the second quarter of  partially offset by a lack of hemostase revenues as the company is no longer distributing this product 
a detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for bioglue and biofoam  perclot and hemostase  revascularization technologies  and hero grafts are presented below 
bioglue and biofoam revenues from the sale of surgical sealants  consisting of bioglue and biofoam  increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average sales prices  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of surgical sealants increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average sales prices  which increased revenues by  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which decreased revenues by 
the increase in sales volume of surgical sealants for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in shipments of bioglue in certain international markets 
for the three months ended december  these increases were primarily in europe  and for the twelve months ended december  these increases were primarily in japan and europe 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in the volume of milliliters sold in the company s more mature domestic markets of for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three months and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the company began shipping bioglue to japan in late april  following the japanese approval of bioglue for use in the repair of aortic dissections 
revenues from shipments to japan for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and million  respectively 
management believes that the decrease in bioglue shipments in its domestic markets is a result of various factors  including poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  the resulting attempts by hospitals to control costs by reducing spending on consumable items such as bioglue  the efforts of some large competitors in imposing and enforcing contract purchasing requirements for competing non cryolife products  and the us market introduction of sealant products with approved indications for use in clinical applications in which bioglue has been used off label previously 
the company s sales of surgical sealants through its direct sales force to uk hospitals are denominated in british pounds  and its sales to german  austrian  and irish hospitals and certain distributors are denominated in euros and are  therefore  subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 
if the exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound or euro decline materially in the future  this would have a material  adverse impact on the company s revenues denominated in these currencies 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
biofoam sales accounted for less than of surgical sealant sales for the three and twelve months ended december  biofoam is currently approved for sale in certain international markets 
bioglue is a mature product in the us and europe that has experienced increasing competitive pressures 
management believes that bioglue sales volume in domestic markets will continue to be impacted by the factors discussed above  and that poor economic conditions in europe could negatively impact sales in future periods 
management also believes that international bioglue sales will be positively impacted by increased shipments to japan in as compared to the corresponding periods in  although this increase will be less than the increase experienced in over perclot and hemostase revenues from the sale of perclot increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of grams sold  which increased revenues by  partially offset by a decrease in average sales prices and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
revenues during these three month periods were for sales in certain international markets  as perclot has not yet been approved for domestic distribution or widespread international distribution 
this increase was primarily due to increased sales in the company s markets in europe and due to the recent approval of perclot in additional countries 
hemostase was not distributed during the three months ended december  or revenues from the sale of hemostats  consisting of perclot and hemostase  decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the revenue decrease in the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decrease in hemostat sales volume in domestic markets  as discussed further below  and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which decreased revenues by 
international hemostat revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase in international hemostat revenues was primarily due to increased perclot sales into the company s markets in europe and due to the recent approval of perclot in additional countries  partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates 
international perclot sales for the twelve months ended december  exceeded combined perclot and hemostase international sales for the twelve months ended december   which included large hemostase orders filled in the first quarter of in anticipation of a disruption in the availability of hemostats to the company s distributors in these countries beginning in this disruption was due to the company s planned march discontinuance of hemostase sales subsequent to the termination of its exclusive distribution agreement eda for this product 
the decrease in domestic sales volume for the twelve months ended december  was due to the company s discontinuation of sales of hemostase as discussed above 
the company recognized domestic hemostat sales in the first quarter of and recognized no domestic hemostat sales in the corresponding period in domestic hemostat sales ended with the discontinuance of hemostase sales  as perclot has not yet been approved for commercial distribution in domestic markets 
the company will not be able to sell perclot in the us in future years unless and until fda approval is granted 
on march  cryolife refiled for an investigational device exemption ide with the fda seeking approval to begin clinical trials for the purpose of obtaining premarket approval to distribute perclot in the us the fda responded to the company s ide during the second quarter of  and the company filed a revised ide in november cryolife has received questions from the fda related to this filing and is currently working to address the questions and expects to respond to the fda in the first quarter of the company s sales of hemostats through its direct sales force to uk hospitals are denominated in british pounds  and its sales to german  austrian  and irish hospitals and certain distributors are denominated in euros and are  therefore  subject to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange rates for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to a decline in the value of the euro when compared to the corresponding periods in if the exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound or euro decline materially in future periods  this would have a material  adverse impact on the company s revenues denominated in these currencies 
changes in exchange rates will have a more material impact on hemostat revenues than the company s other product lines  as a larger percentage of the company s hemostat sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
management believes that competitive pressures and economic conditions in europe could negatively impact perclot sales in poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets are expected to drive continued pricing pressures  especially due to the many hemostatic agents currently competing for market share in europe 
revascularization technologies revenues from revascularization technologies include revenues related to the sale of handpieces and accessories and  in certain periods  revenues from the sale of laser consoles 
revenues from revascularization technologies decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  revenues from the sale of laser consoles were zero and  in the three months ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from the sale of handpieces and accessories increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in average sales prices  which increased revenues by  and an increase in volume  which increased revenues by 
revenues from revascularization technologies increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   as revascularization technologies were not marketed by the company for the full twelve month prior year period 
the company began marketing revascularization technologies following its acquisition of cardiogenesis in may revenues from the sale of laser consoles were  and  in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
revascularization technologies revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased when compared to the combined pre and post acquisition revenues for the twelve months ended december  revenues from the sale of laser consoles were  in the twelve months ended december  and million in the combined pre and post acquisition period ended december  revenues from the sale of handpieces and accessories decreased for the twelve months ended december  when compared to the combined pre and post acquisition revenues for the twelve months ended december  these decreases were primarily due to increasing competitive pressures and challenges in selling laser consoles in recent periods  both of which have negatively impacted handpiece revenues 
revenues from laser consoles have been negatively impacted by the current economic environment  which makes hospitals reluctant to invest in large capital purchases 
the company believes that the effects of competitive pressures and challenges in selling laser consoles may continue to negatively impact handpiece sales and laser console sales into the amount of revenues from the sale of laser consoles can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to the long lead time required to generate sales of capital equipment and due to the higher selling price of consoles as compared to handpieces 
handpieces and laser consoles are primarily distributed in domestic markets 
hero graft revenues from hero grafts for the three and twelve months ended december  were a result of the company s acquisition of hemosphere in may revenues from hero grafts include revenues related to the sale of vascular grafts  venous outflow components  and accessories  which are generally sold together as a kit 
hero grafts are primarily distributed in domestic markets 
other revenues other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  and included revenues related to funding allocated from us congress defense appropriations conference reports in through  collectively the dod grants 
as of december  cryolife had been awarded million and had received a total of million for the development of protein hydrogel technology  which the company is currently developing for use in organ sealing 
at december  cryolife had million included in deferred income on the company s consolidated balance sheet from the dod grants  of which  remains in unspent cash advances recorded as cash and cash equivalents 
in early the dod grants were amended to reduce the total award to million 
the company has discontinued its biofoam us clinical trial and  after the trial is formally closed out  any remaining unspent funds will be returned to the us department of defense dod 
cost of preservation services and products cost of preservation services three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of preservation services cost of preservation services increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december   as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
cost of preservation services includes costs for cardiac and vascular tissue preservation services 
the increase in cost of preservation services in the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increased shipments of cardiac and vascular tissues during these periods  partially offset by a decrease in costs 
cost of preservation services for the three and twelve months ended december  included  in unusual processing expenses due to certain supplies of processing solutions used in the processing of tissues that did not meet the company s quality requirements 
cost of products three months ended december  twelve months ended december  cost of products cost of products increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
cost of products in includes costs related to bioglue  biofoam  perclot  revascularization technologies  and hero grafts 
cost of products in includes costs related to bioglue  biofoam  perclot  hemostase  and revascularization technologies 
the increase in cost of products in the three months ended december  was primarily due to the addition of hero graft revenues 
the increase in cost of products in the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the addition of hero graft and revascularization technologies handpiece revenues  and the increase in bioglue sales volume  partially offset by the discontinuation of hemostase sales 
gross margin three months ended december  twelve months ended december  gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenues gross margin increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
gross margin increased primarily due to an increase in revenues during the periods 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a change in service and product mix as the company s higher margin medical devices segment made up a larger percentage of its business in operating expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  general  administrative  and marketing expenses general  administrative  and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the twelve months ended december  include a million gain on the settlement of the lawsuit with medafor  inc medafor and a million loss for the settlement of the lawsuit with cardiofocus  inc cardiofocus related to a claim of patent infringement by the company s cardiogenesis laser products 
both of these lawsuits were settled in the second quarter of legal fees related to lawsuits  primarily the medafor and cardiofocus lawsuits  were million for the twelve months ended december   and reductions to legal fees for insurance reimbursements for certain litigation expenses were million for the twelve months ended december  business development costs  primarily related to the acquisition and integration of hemosphere  were  and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
business development costs  primarily related to the acquisition and integration of cardiogenesis  were  and million for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the company does not anticipate that it will have significant business development costs related to the acquisitions of hemosphere and cardiogenesis in general  administrative  and marketing expenses for the three and twelve months ended december  also increased due to an increase in marketing expenses  including the costs of the company s expanded sales staff from its recent acquisitions of hemosphere and cardiogenesis and increases in spending on advertising 
the company expects that its general  administrative  and marketing expenses will increase in as compared to due to increased costs related to its acquisition of hemosphere and due to the excise tax on the sale of medical devices in the us that went into effect on january  as part of the patient protection and affordable care act passed in the company believes that its synergraft processed tissues and the majority of its medical devices will be subject to the tax and that its traditionally processed tissues will not be subject to the tax 
research and development expenses three months ended december  twelve months ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues research and development expenses increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
research and development spending for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily focused on perclot  hero graft  revascularization technologies  the company s synergraft tissues and products  and biofoam 
the company expects that research and development spending will increase materially in due to planned increases in spending on clinical studies related to perclot 
earnings three months ended december  twelve months ended december  income before income taxes income tax expense net income diluted income per common share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding income before income taxes decreased for the three months and increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the decrease in income before income taxes for the three months ended december  was primarily caused by an increase in operating expenses as discussed above  partially offset by an increase in gross margin 
the increase in income before income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was primarily caused by an increase in gross margin  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as discussed above 
the company s effective income tax rate was approximately for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  the company s income tax rates for the three and twelve months ended december  were favorably impacted by  in adjustments to valuation allowances on certain of the company s state net operating loss carryforwards  based on revised estimates of utilization of these carryforwards 
actual usage will be dependent on a variety of factors and could change  although this favorable impact is not expected to recur in future periods 
the company s income tax rates for the three and twelve months ended december  were also impacted by the unfavorable tax treatment of certain acquisition related expenses due to the acquisition of hemosphere and by the research and development tax credit  which had not been enacted for the tax year 
the company s effective income tax rate for the twelve months ended december  was impacted by the discrete and favorable effect of deductions taken on the company s federal tax returns  which were filed in the third quarter of this favorable effect was largely offset by the unfavorable tax treatment  recognized in the second quarter of  of certain acquisition related expenses  which the company incurred related to its acquisition of cardiogenesis 
the company anticipates that its tax rate will be favorably impacted by the research and development tax credit 
as this credit was enacted for the tax year in january  the company will record the favorable impact of the full year credit in the first quarter of net income and diluted income per common share increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december   primarily due to the decrease in income tax expense 
net income and diluted income per common share increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to the increase in income before income taxes  as discussed above 
diluted income per common share could be unfavorably impacted in future periods by the issuance of additional shares of common stock and favorably impacted by the company s repurchase of its common stock 
stock repurchases are impacted by many factors  including stock price  available funds  and competing demands for such funds  and as a result  may be suspended or discontinued at any time

a detailed discussion of the changes in preservation services revenues  product revenues  and other revenues for the three and twelve months ended december  is presented below 
preservation services revenues from preservation services increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  the increase for the three months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in vascular preservation services revenues 
preservation services revenues for the twelve months ended december  were comparable to revenues for the twelve months ended december  see further discussion of cardiac and vascular preservation services revenues below 
cardiac preservation services revenues from cardiac preservation services consisting of revenues from the distribution of heart valves and cardiac patch tissues decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the aggregate impact of a decrease in volume and tissue mix  which decreased revenues by  partially offset by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by

revenues from vascular preservation services increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   primarily due to a increase in unit shipments of vascular tissues  which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
the increase in vascular tissue volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increases in shipments of saphenous veins  resulting from the strong demand for these tissues in domestic markets  primarily for use in peripheral vascular reconstruction surgeries to avoid limb amputations 
products revenues from products increased for the three months and for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
these increases were primarily due to revenues from revascularization technologies as a result of the company s acquisition of cardiogenesis in the second quarter of and  to a lesser extent  due to an increase in perclot and bioglue revenues  partially offset by a decrease in hemostase revenues 
a detailed discussion of the changes in product revenues for bioglue and biofoam  perclot and hemostase  and revascularization technologies is presented below 
bioglue and biofoam revenues from the sale of surgical sealants  consisting of bioglue and biofoam  increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by  and by an increase in average service fees  which increased revenues by 
revenues from the sale of surgical sealants increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily due to a increase in the volume of milliliters sold  which increased revenues by  and the favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  which increased revenues by the increase in sales volume of surgical sealants for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to an increase in shipments of bioglue in certain international markets  primarily japan 
the company began shipping bioglue to japan in late april  following the japanese approval of bioglue for use in the repair of aortic dissections 
revenues from shipments to japan for the three and twelve months ended december  were  and million  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by volume decreases in the company s more mature domestic and european markets 
management believes that the decrease in bioglue shipments in its domestic markets is a result of various factors  including the us market introduction of sealant products with approved indications for use in clinical applications in which bioglue has been used off label previously  poor economic conditions and their constraining effect on hospital budgets  the resulting attempts by hospitals to control costs by reducing spending on consumable items such as bioglue  and the efforts of some large competitors in imposing and enforcing contract purchasing requirements for competing non cryolife products 
management believes that the decline in european volume may be due to general economic conditions in europe  specifically in the euro zone countries 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  and and of total bioglue revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
biofoam sales accounted for less than of surgical sealant sales for the three and twelve months ended december  biofoam is currently approved for sale in certain international markets 
perclot and hemostase revenues from the sale of hemostats  consisting of perclot and hemostase  decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  revenues from the sale of hemostats decreased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  the revenue decreases in the three and twelve months ended december  were primarily due to a decrease in hemostat sales volume in domestic markets  as discussed further below 
for the twelve months ended december  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volume in international markets in the year to date period 
international hemostat revenues decreased for the three months ended december  as compared to the three months ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in sales in certain international markets  particularly in canada and south america due to large orders filled in the fourth quarter of in anticipation of a disruption in the availability of hemostats to the company s distributors in these countries beginning in early this disruption was due to the company s planned march discontinuance of hemostase sales subsequent to the termination of its eda for this product  discussed further below 
international hemostat revenues increased for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december  this increase is primarily due to an increase in international sales of perclot in the periods over the international sales of hemostase in the corresponding periods 
management believes that international perclot revenues were favorably impacted by the company s ability to market perclot for all surgical specialties  expanding the direct european sales force into austria  and perclot s product performance when compared to other hemostatic agents 
the decrease in domestic sales volume for the three and twelve months ended december  was due to the company s planned discontinuation of sales of hemostase in late march  as a result of medafor s termination of its eda with the company 
the company recognized no domestic hemostat sales in the second  third  or fourth quarters of  subsequent to the discontinuance of hemostase sales  as perclot has not yet been approved for commercial distribution in domestic markets

management believes this trend for vascular preservation services is primarily due to fewer surgeries being scheduled during the winter holiday months 
the company believes the demand for bioglue is seasonal  with a decline in demand generally occurring in the third quarter followed by stronger demand in the fourth quarter 
management believes that this trend for bioglue may be due to the summer holiday season in europe and fewer surgeries being performed on adult patients in the summer months in the us the company is uncertain whether the demand for perclot will be seasonal  as perclot is a new product and the nature of any seasonal trends in perclot sales may be obscured 
the company is uncertain whether the demand for revascularization technologies will be seasonal  as the company only recently acquired this product line in may  and the historical data does not indicate a significant trend 
the company is uncertain whether the demand for hero grafts will be seasonal  as the company only recently acquired this product line in may  and the historical data does not indicate a significant trend
