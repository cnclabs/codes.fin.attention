overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients 
we have three product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen  ogx and ogx  each of which has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development 
of the product candidates in our pipeline  custirsen and ogx are clinical stage assets 
our product candidates custirsen  ogx and ogx focus on mechanisms of treatment resistance in cancer patients and are designed to block the production of specific proteins that we believe promote survival of tumor cells and are over produced in response to a variety of cancer treatments 
our aim in targeting these particular proteins is to disable the tumor cell s adaptive defenses  thereby rendering the tumor cells more susceptible to attack with a variety of cancer therapies 
we believe this approach will increase survival time and improve the quality of life for cancer patients 

table of contents product candidate custirsen as discussed above  in december  we announced our entry into the collaboration agreement with teva for the development and global commercialization of custirsen and related compounds targeting clusterin  excluding ogx and ogx 
we and teva have developed an amended clinical development plan under which the following three phase clinical trials have been initiated the synergy trial the phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with first line docetaxel treatment in patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer  or crpc 
during discussions with the us food and drug administration  or fda  the fda informed us that an application supported primarily by the results of synergy alone would be acceptable for submission for market approval 
synergy patient enrollment was completed in the fourth quarter of over  men have now been enrolled in order to show a survival benefit with power based on a hazard ratio of 
the expected timing of results is based on a pre specified number of death events that is projected to occur in the fourth quarter of  with data results expected to be announced in the first half of the affinity trial the phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel treatment as second line chemotherapy in patients with crpc 
we expect to enroll approximately patients to show a survival benefit with power based on a hazard ratio of 
we initiated this phase clinical trial in august the enspirit trial the phase clinical trial to evaluate a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel treatment as second line chemotherapy in patients with non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we expect to enroll approximately  patients in order to show a survival benefit with power based on a hazard ratio of 
this trial was initiated by teva in september two formal interim analyses are planned for stopping the trial early based on inadequate evidence of clinical benefit or futility 
we will be evaluating both pfs and os during the interim analyses 
if both endpoints meet the predefined criteria for inadequate pfs clinical benefit and os futility the trial would be stopped 
the trial will not be stopped early in order to claim efficacy 
for detailed information regarding our relationship with teva and the collaboration agreement  refer to the discussion under the heading business license and collaboration agreements teva pharmaceutical industries ltd 
custirsen received fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of progressive metastatic prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel 
the fda has also agreed on the design of the synergy trial through the special protocol assessment process 
we have also received written  scientific advice from the european medicines agency  or ema  on our development plan for custirsen for treating patients with crpc in combination with docetaxel  which aligned with our development plan regarding the proposed preclinical studies and both the study design and analyses for the phase synergy trial 
in addition  the committee for medicinal products for human use agreed that the intended safety database would enable a sufficient qualified risk benefit assessment for market approval 
we and collaborating investigators have conducted five phase clinical trials to evaluate the ability of custirsen to enhance the effects of therapy in patients with prostate  non small cell lung and breast cancers 
results have been presented for each of these phase trials 
our phase registration trials have been designed based on our phase clinical trials 
data from these phase studies demonstrate the potential benefit of adding custirsen  a second generation antisense molecule  to existing cancer therapies 
refer to the discussion above under the headings our product candidates custirsen current custirsen development activities and our product candidates custirsen summary of results of custirsen phase clinical trials for further details 

table of contents product candidate ogx ogx is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of heat shock protein  or hsp  a cell survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder  prostate  breast and non small cell lung cancer 
hsp expression is stress induced  including by many anti cancer therapies 
for example  hsp levels increased four fold in prostate cancer patients after treatment with chemotherapy or hormone therapy 
overexpression of hsp is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis  negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types 
in  we initiated the orca on going studies evaluating treatment resistance in cancer program which encompasses clinical studies designed to evaluate whether inhibition of hsp can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients 
our goal is to advance cancer treatment by conducting clinical trials for ogx across multiple cancer indications including  but not limited to bladder cancer and crpc 
consistent with the strategy that we have followed for custirsen  we intend to conduct parallel clinical trials to evaluate ogx in several cancer indications and treatment combination to accelerate the development of ogx in addition to oncogenex sponsored trials  specific investigator sponsored trials will be supported to allow assessment of a broader range of clinical indications for future oncogenex sponsored trials for possible market approval 
logo our current ogx development activities for bladder cancer include the following clinical trials that have been initiated the bl trial an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial to evaluate ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with bladder cancer 
the trial is currently enrolling patients 
it is designed to determine the safety and potential benefit of ogx administered into the bladder using intravesical instillation 
in addition  the trial will measure the direct effect of ogx on expression of hsp in bladder tumor cells  as well as determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ogx when delivered by intravesical instillation 
this clinical trial is being funded by the national cancer institute of canada 
preliminary data were presented at the asco gu symposium in february 
table of contents the borealis trial an oncogenex sponsored phase clinical trial of ogx in patients with metastatic bladder cancer 
borealis is a three arm  randomized  placebo controlled phase trial evaluating ogx in combination with first line gemcitabine and cisplatin treatment in the metastatic setting 
each arm is currently enrolling approximately patients  the trial has been initiated in sites throughout the united states  canada and europe 
the trial will be conducted as an event driven trial such that the final analysis will have power to show a critical hazard ratio of approximately to 
this type of phase trial will allow us to better predict the potential size of and success for a phase trial where a survival benefit will be the primary endpoint 
this study is ongoing with an enrollment target of approximately patients 
we expect to complete patient accrual in the second half of the borealis trial the investigator sponsored  randomized  controlled phase study evaluating ogx in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have disease progression following initial platinum based chemotherapy 
this study is designed to have adequate power to detect a survival benefit in the docetaxel ogx arm corresponding to a hazard ratio docetaxel ogx docetaxel 
the primary analysis is to be performed at one sided significance level with power to detect this os difference 
we expect to enroll approximately patients to receive either ogx plus docetaxel treatment or docetaxel treatment alone 
patients may also continue weekly ogx infusions as maintenance treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity if they complete all cycles of docetaxel  or are discontinued from docetaxel due to docetaxel toxicity 
we expect this trial to be initiated in the first half of our current ogx development activities for prostate cancer include the following clinical trials that have been initiated the pr trial an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered with prednisone to patients with crpc 
pr has completed enrollment with data collection ongoing 
this randomized  controlled phase clinical trial enrolled patients who had minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic advanced prostate cancer and who had not yet received chemotherapy 
this trial is measuring the direct effect of ogx on prostate specific antigen  or psa  levels  time to progression by psa or measurable disease  numbers of circulating tumor cells  or ctcs  and other relevant secondary endpoints 
preliminary data were presented at several conferences throughout  most recently at the european society for medical oncology  or esmo  meeting in september the pacific trial an investigator sponsored  randomized phase study evaluating ogx in men with crpc who are experiencing a rising psa while receiving zytiga abiraterone acetate 
the aim of the study is to determine if adding ogx to zytiga treatment can reverse or delay treatment resistance 
approximately patients will be enrolled 
the trial was initiated in december additional phase investigator sponsored studies evaluating ogx in other malignancies are under development 
further details of these studies will be provided when the trials are initiated 
results of these studies may direct future company sponsored trials in indications that show promising clinical benefits 
refer to the discussion above under the headings our product candidates ogx summary of results of ogx clinical trials for further details 
product candidates ogx ogx  an inhibitor of insulin growth factor binding proteins and  is in preclinical development 
we are currently evaluating various alternatives  including partnering  which would allow us to further the development of this preclinical asset 
we have begun development activities for ogx and we expect to initiate toxicology studies in the second half of collaboration revenue we recorded million of collaboration revenue in connection with our collaboration agreement with teva in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  at december   the million upfront collaboration payment was fully expended resulting in a current deferred collaboration revenue balance of zero 
teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the amended clinical development plan 
we are eligible to receive payments of up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones set forth in the collaboration agreement 
at present  we are unable to predict the timing or likelihood of such milestone payments  although we did not receive any payments from teva resulting from the achievement of developmental or commercial milestones or royalties in  and we do not expect to receive any such payments from teva in moreover  isis has disclosed in its securities and exchange commission  or sec  filings that it is entitled to receive of the up to million in milestone payments we may receive from teva as part of the collaboration agreement 
we disagree with their assessment but believe there may be some lesser payment obligation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
research and development expenses research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of costs for clinical trials  contract manufacturing  personnel costs  milestone payments to third parties  facilities  regulatory activities  preclinical studies and allocations of other r d related costs 
external expenses for clinical trials include fees paid to clinical research organizations  clinical trial site costs and patient treatment costs 

table of contents currently  we manage our clinical trials through contract research organizations and independent medical investigators at their sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue 
through our clinical development programs  we are developing each of our product candidates in parallel for multiple disease indications 
due to the number of ongoing projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  we do not record or maintain information regarding the indirect operating costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program specific basis 
in addition  we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project 
as of december   we had spent the entire million related to the development of custirsen  as required under the collaboration agreement 
teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the amended clinical development plan 
we expect aggregate full time equivalent reimbursement of between and million annually from to  which will be reimbursed to us from teva 
a majority of our expenditures to date have been related to the development of custirsen 
until july   custirsen was being co developed with isis and r d expenses for custirsen were shared by us and by isis 
on july   we and isis amended the agreement to provide for unilateral development of custirsen by us 
in connection with the collaboration agreement and pursuant to the terms of agreements between us and isis relating to custirsen  we paid million to isis in the first quarter of  which was included in r d expenses in we also paid million to ubc in the first quarter of pursuant to the terms of the license agreement relating to custirsen  which was also included in r d expenses in several of our clinical trials have been supported by grant funding that was received directly by the hospitals and or clinical investigators conducting the clinical trials  thereby allowing us to complete these clinical trials at a lower cost to us 
since our drug candidates are in the early stages of development  we cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our r d projects  if ever 
our projects or intended r d activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
we expect our r d expenses to increase in and into the future  likely significantly  as we further expand development of custirsen  ogx and our other programs 
our programs or anticipated programs may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate our r d priorities and available resources 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive  business development  human resources  external communications  finance and other administrative functions  as well as consulting costs  including market research and business consulting and intellectual property 
other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services  insurance and facility costs 
while we believe that g a resources are sufficient to carry on existing development activities we anticipate that g a expenses will increase in the future as we continue to expand our operating activities 
excess lease liability on august   sonus pharmaceuticals  inc sonus completed a transaction the arrangement with oncogenex technologies inc  oncogenex technologies whereby sonus acquired all of the outstanding preferred shares  common shares and convertible debentures of oncogenex technologies 
sonus then changed its name to oncogenex pharmaceuticals  inc prior to the arrangement  sonus entered into a non cancellable lease arrangement for office space located in bothell  washington  which is considered to be in excess of the company s current requirements 
the liability is computed as the present value of the difference between the remaining lease 
table of contents payments due less the estimate of net sublease income and expenses and has been accounted for in accordance with the then effective eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination 
this represents the company s best estimate of the liability 
subsequent changes in the liability due to changes in estimates of sublease and occupancy assumptions are recognized as adjustments to the related liability with an offset to restructuring gain loss in future periods 
in december  we decided to expand our occupancy of the bothell facility and revised our assumptions used to estimate the excess lease facility liability 
as of december  the estimated value of the liability was million compared with million as of december  the change in the estimated liability resulted from million amortized into income through research and development expense and a reduction of the liability of million recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the updated assumptions related to occupancy of the bothell facility 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  from million for the year ended december  revenue was million for the year ended december  the increase in compared to was due to an increase in revenue earned through our strategic collaboration with teva  as a result of the clinical development activities associated with the affinity trial which was initiated in august revenue for includes recognition of million from the million upfront payment  as well as million earned through collaborative research 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the annual report on form k for further details on our collaboration with teva 
the decrease in compared to was due to lower reimbursement revenue earned through our strategic collaboration with teva resulting from manufacturing costs being paid directly by teva and lower clinical trial costs associated with the saturn trial 
research and development expenses r d expenses for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the year ended december  r d expenses for the year ended december  were million 
the increase in as compared to was due primarily to higher clinical study expenses associated with the startup of the affinity trial  increased patient enrollment in our clinical trial evaluating ogx in combination with initial chemotherapy in patients with metastatic bladder cancer and associated manufacturing costs and increased employee expenses  including stock based compensation expense 
these increases were partially offset by lower preclinical expenses 
the increase in as compared to was due primarily to higher ogx clinical trial and manufacturing costs  higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation 
these increases were largely offset by lower custirsen manufacturing costs  as these costs are being paid directly by teva 
certain costs for the custirsen phase clinical trials are applied against the non refundable upfront payments received from teva in december  while costs unassociated with the affinity trial  such as manufacturing costs and compensation for work performed by our employees on the synergy trial are reimbursed from teva 
we expect r d expenses to increase as we further develop custirsen and our proprietary product candidates 
our research and development expenses for our clinical development programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  clinical development programs custirsen ogx other research and development total research and development expenses 
table of contents general and administrative expenses g a expenses for the years ended december   and increased to million from million and from million  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was due primarily to higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation expenses and infrastructure related costs 
the increase in compared with was due primarily to higher employee expenses  including stock based compensation expenses 
restructuring gain expense restructuring gain for the year ended december  was million  as compared with zero in restructuring expense was million in the year ended december  in december  we decided to expand our occupancy of the bothell facility and revised our assumptions used to estimate the value of the excess lease facility liability 
this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in the value of our excess lease liability and a million restructuring gain recorded in the fourth quarter of to reflect this change in estimate 
in september  we revised our sublease income assumptions used to estimate the value of the excess lease facility liability 
this change in estimate resulted in an increase in the value of our excess lease liability and a million restructuring expense was recorded in the third quarter of to reflect this change in estimate 
revaluation of warrants we recorded a million gain on revaluation of the warrants for the year ended december   which is included on our consolidated statement of loss as a gain on warrants 
a million gain on revaluation of the warrants was recorded for the year ended december  we revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value 
if unexercised  the warrants will expire in october interest income interest income for the year ended december   and increased to million from million and million  respectively 
the increase in both years was due to higher average balances of interest bearing securities 
other income other income for the year ended december  increased to million  from  for the years ended december  and the income earned in the year ended december  relates primarily to a gain from a barter transaction  while income earned in december  and relate to gains on foreign exchange 
income tax recovery an income tax recovery of million was recorded in the second quarter of  as we received approval from the israeli tax authority  or ita  for its request for a withholdings tax exemption on amounts received from teva in relation to the collaboration 
under the collaboration agreement  teva paid us million in upfront payments  of which million was for an upfront milestone payment and subject to possible withholding taxes by the ita 
prior to the receipt of the approval  teva was granted a temporary exemption for a transfer of million of the million upfront milestone payment 
this temporary exemption was conditioned upon teva s depositing million  which represented of the upfront milestone payment paid according to the collaboration agreement  in a trust account in favor of the ita until a final decision would be made by the ita regarding the request 
accordingly  
table of contents prior to the receipt of the approval  we had recorded a million liability recognizing this amount as an uncertain tax position 
following this approval from the ita  this liability was released  and we recorded a million income tax recovery 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details on our collaboration with teva 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred an accumulated deficit of million through december   and we expect to incur substantial and increasing additional losses in the future as we expand our r d activities and other operations  as more fully described below 
we have not generated any revenue from product sales to date  and we do not expect to generate product sales revenue for several years  if ever 
in the year ended december   we generated million in collaboration revenue from the collaboration agreement with teva 
in march we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
the total net proceeds to us from the public offering and exercise of the overallotment option  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses from the sale of the shares  were approximately million 
all of our operations to date have been funded through the sale of our equity securities and payments received from teva 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments increased to million in the aggregate from million as of december  based on our current expectations  we believe our capital resources at december  will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into our currently planned operations are set forth below under the heading operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
cash flows operating activities for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities increased to million  from million in the year ended december  the increase in cash used in operations is primarily attributable to our custirsen phase clinical trial costs associated with the affinity trial  ogx clinical trial and manufacturing costs and higher employee expenses 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million 
the decrease in compared with was attributable primarily to payments made to isis and ubc in the first quarter of resulting from the collaboration agreement with teva and lower custirsen manufacturing costs  as these costs are now being paid directly by teva  partially offset by higher ogx clinical and manufacturing costs in financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities increased to million from million for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities in for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds we received from the public offering of our common stock that closed in march as well as proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was the result of proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was million  resulting from net proceeds we received from the issuance of common shares pursuant to the financing we completed in october and proceeds from stock option exercises 

table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared with net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million net cash used in and provided by investing activities in all years was due to transactions involving marketable securities in the normal course of business 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including for working capital purposes  capital expenditures  and various contractual obligations for at least the next months 
we also believe that our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and receivables from teva will be sufficient to fund our currently planned operations into including completing the synergy trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel as first line chemotherapy 
synergy patient enrollment was completed in the fourth quarter of over  men have now been enrolled  completing patient enrollment in the affinity trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with cabazitaxel as second line chemotherapy in approximately patients with crpc  which was initiated in august enrolling patients in the enspirit trial  a phase clinical trial that is evaluating a survival benefit for custirsen in combination with docetaxel as second line chemotherapy in approximately  patients with nsclc  which was initiated in september and is being conducted by our partner teva  completing patient enrollment in the borealis oncogenex sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx in combination with standard first line chemotherapy in approximately patients with metastatic bladder cancer called the borealis trial  initiating the borealis trial  an investigator sponsored  randomized  controlled phase study evaluating ogx in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have disease progression following initial platinum based chemotherapy first line treatment  completing the bl trial  an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx when administered directly into the bladder in patients with superficial or muscle invasive bladder cancer  completing the pr trial  an investigator sponsored phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in combination with prednisone in patients with prostate cancer who have not received chemotherapy  enrolling patients in the pacific trial  a phase clinical trial evaluating ogx treatment in combination with zytiga in patients with prostate cancer  and initiating other additional clinical trials evaluating ogx  and initiating ogx toxicology studies 
as of december   we had contributed million to the development of custirsen  as required under the collaboration agreement 
teva is required to fund all additional expenses under the amended clinical development plan 
while we currently have sufficient operating capital to fund our currently planned operations through the expected release of final data from the synergy trial  the final results from the affinity and enspirit phase trials may be released at a date that is beyond the period for which we currently project we have available cash resources 
in addition  if we were to conduct development activities with respect to our other product candidates beyond those development activities mentioned in the list above  including activities with respect to 
table of contents ogx  we would require additional funding to support such operations 
if we need to extend our cash availability  or to conduct any such currently unplanned development activities  we would seek such necessary funding through the licensing or sale of certain of our product candidates  by executing a partnership or collaboration agreement  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including timing  costs and results of clinical trials  preclinical development and regulatory approvals  success of custirsen including achieving milestones and royalties  maintaining our relationship with teva and teva s ongoing level of focus and efforts to develop custirsen  timing  costs and results of drug discovery and r d  entering into new collaborative or product license agreements for products in our pipeline  our ability to obtain additional funding through a partnership or collaboration agreement with a third party or licenses of certain of our product candidates  or through private or public offerings of our equity or debt  and costs related to obtaining  defending and enforcing patents 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands of us dollars total year years years thereafter bothell office operating lease vancouver office operating lease ubc license maintenance fees leased equipment total this operating lease  which commenced in  is for a year term and includes two five year option renewals 
this operating lease expires in we are obligated to pay an annual license maintenance fee of cad  to ubc  which has been converted to us dollars based on the december  exchange rate of us cad  and rounded to the nearest  off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements at december  inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business and results of operations during the periods presented 

table of contents material changes in financial condition in thousands december  december  total assets total liabilities total equity the increase in assets at december  from december  primarily relates to net proceeds received from the public offering of our common stock that closed in march the decrease in liabilities at december  from december  relates predominantly to the recognition of deferred collaboration revenue  revaluation of the warrant liability and amortization of restructuring related liabilities 
the increase in equity relates primarily to the issuance of common stock from the march public offering  partially offset by the net loss for the period 
critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions principally relate to estimates of the fair value of our warrant liability and excess lease facility liability  estimates of the initial fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options issued to employees and consultants and clinical trial and manufacturing accruals 
cash equivalents we consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  which we consider as available for sale and are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity 
short term investments short term investments consist of financial instruments purchased with an original maturity of greater than three months and less than one year 
we consider our short term investments as available for sale and they are carried at market value with unrealized gains and losses except other than temporary losses  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss  which is a separate component of shareholders equity 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities are recognized in net income or loss 
the cost of investments sold is based on the specific identification method 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities is based on quoted market prices and trade data for comparable securities 
we determine the fair value of its warrant liability based on the black scholes pricing model and using considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
other financial instruments including amounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities  are carried at cost  which we believe approximates fair value because of the short term maturities of these instruments 
intellectual property the costs of acquiring intellectual property rights to be used in the research and development process  including licensing fees and milestone payments  are charged to research and development expense as incurred in situations where we have not identified an alternative future use for the acquired rights  and are capitalized in situations where it has identified an alternative future use 
no costs associated with acquiring intellectual property rights have been capitalized to date 
costs of maintaining intellectual property rights are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition revenue recognized to date is attributable solely to the upfront payment we received in the fourth quarter of pursuant to our collaboration agreement with teva  as well as cash reimbursements from teva for certain costs incurred by us under the clinical development plan we and teva developed under which three phase clinical trials have been initiated 
under the collaboration agreement  we and teva share certain custirsen related development costs 
we have spent the required million in direct and indirect development costs  such as full time equivalent fte reimbursement for time incurred by our personnel for the benefit of the custirsen development plan 
on a quarterly basis teva will fund all other expenses under the clinical development plan 
our policy is to account for these reimbursements as collaboration revenue 
for a summary description of the collaboration agreement  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the collaboration agreement contains multiple elements and deliverables  and requires evaluation pursuant to asc  multiple element arrangements  or asc we evaluated the facts and circumstances of the collaboration agreement to determine whether it had obligations constituting deliverables under asc we concluded that it had multiple deliverables under the collaboration agreement  including deliverables relating to the grant of a technology license  and performance of manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services in the us and canada  and estimated that the period in which we would perform those deliverables began in the fourth quarter of and will be completed in the fourth quarter of because we were able to establish vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the fair value of the maintenance  regulatory  and clinical services  we concluded that these deliverables should be accounted as separate units of accounting under asc in establishing vsoe for the manufacturing  regulatory  and clinical development services  management relied on rates charged by other service providers providing similar development services 
we have now recognized the entire million allocated to the manufacturing  regulatory and clinical development services element as revenue on a proportional performance basis  as we incurred direct and indirect development costs under the collaboration agreement 
as the direct and indirect costs associated with the clinical development plan were incurred and the associated revenue was recognized  the current deferred collaboration revenue balance was reduced to zero as at december  because management was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of the technology license  it used the residual value approach to determine the amount of revenue to recognize 
based on this approach  we recognized million in relating to this element 
under the collaboration agreement  we are entitled to receive up to million upon the achievement of developmental and commercial milestones 
management evaluated the nature of the events triggering these contingent payments and concluded that these events constituted substantive milestones 
this conclusion was based primarily on the facts that each triggering event represents a specific outcome that can be achieved only through successful performance by us of one or more of our deliverables  and that achievement of each triggering event was 
table of contents subject to inherent risk and uncertainty and would result in additional payments becoming due to us 
management concluded that each of these milestones was substantive  based primarily on the facts that the payments they trigger are non refundable  that achievement of the milestone entails risk and was not reasonably assured at inception of the collaboration agreement  that substantial effort is required to complete each milestone  that the amount of each milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the value created in achieving the milestone  that a substantial amount of time is expected to pass between the upfront payment and the potential milestone payments  and that the milestone payments  once received  relate solely to past performance 
based on the foregoing  we will recognize any revenue from these milestone payments under the substantive milestone method in the period in which the underlying triggering event occurs 
under the collaboration agreement  we are also entitled to receive percentage royalties on sales of custirsen ranging from the mid teens to the mid twenties 
we will recognize any revenue from these events based on the revenue recognition criteria set forth in asc  revenue recognition 
based on those criteria  we consider these potential payments to be contingent revenue  and will recognize them as revenue in the period in which the applicable contingency is resolved

table of contents loss per common share basic loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period 
diluted loss per common share is computed in accordance with the treasury stock method 
the effect of potentially issuable common shares from outstanding stock options is anti dilutive for all periods presented 
warrants we account for warrants pursuant to the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities laws  the warrants require the issuance of registered securities upon exercise and therefore do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash settlement 
we classify warrants on the consolidated balance sheet as a liability which is revalued at each balance sheet date subsequent to the initial issuance 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of registered warrants requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and expected warrant life 
the computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of shares of the company s common stock for a period that coincides with the expected life of the warrants 
a small change in the estimates used may have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value the warrants 
changes in the fair market value of the warrants are reflected in the consolidated statement of loss as gain loss on revaluation of warrants

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values and future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of the changes in market interest rates 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars  and we monitor our exposure to interest rate changes is monitored 
we have very limited interest rate risk due to the few assets or liabilities subject to fluctuations in interests rates 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity 
due to the nature of our highly liquid marketable securities  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value 
we have estimated the effect on our portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  foreign currency exchange risk we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency transactions on certain contracts and payroll expenses related to our canadian subsidiary  oncogenex technologies  denominated in canadian dollars and we have not hedged these amounts 
as our unhedged foreign currency transactions fluctuate  our earnings might be negatively affected 
accordingly  changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar might have an adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial condition  and fluctuations in exchange rates might harm our reported results and accounts from period to period 
we have estimated the effect on our reported results of operations of a hypothetical increase of percent in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar to be million for the year ended december
