item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included in item of this report 
unless otherwise specified  all dollar amounts are us dollars 
overview we are an in vitro diagnostic company that has developed a proprietary tear testing platform  the tearlab osmolarity system 
the tearlab test measures tear film osmolarity for diagnosis of dry eye disease  or ded 
tear osmolarity is a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has been shown to correlate with ded 
the tearlab test enables the rapid measurement of tear osmolarity in a doctor office 
commercializing our point of care tear testing platform is now the focus of our business 
in october  the tearlab osmolarity system received ce mark approval  clearing the way for sales in the european union and all countries recognizing the ce mark 
in connection with the ce mark clearance  we have entered into multi year agreements with numerous distributors for distribution of the tearlab osmolarity system 
currently  we have signed distribution agreements in each of the following countries spain  portugal  germany  france  turkey  ukraine  bulgaria  belgium  netherlands  switzerland  finland  sweden  denmark  norway  south korea  australia  russia  hungary  greece  canada  slovakia  argentina  the czech republic  a sales representation agreement in japan and are selling directly to the customer in the united kingdom 
on may   we announced that we received k clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the k clearance allows us to market the tearlab osmolarity system to those reference and physician operated laboratories with clia certifications allowing them to perform moderate and high complexity tests 
considering that most of our target customers currently are eye care practitioners without such certifications  it was necessary that we obtained a clia waiver from the fda for the tearlab osmolarity system as well as assisting our customers in obtaining their moderate complexity clia certification or providing them with support from certified professionals 
a clia waiver greatly reduces the regulatory compliance for our customers 
on march   we announced that we received communication from the fda indicating that the data submitted by the company was not sufficient to gain approval of the clia waiver categorization application for the tearlab osmolarity system 
we appealed to the fda and on december   we announced that we had received a communication from the fda indicating that  based on a supervisory review of the company s appeal  the fda had granted our petition for a waiver under clia for the tearlab osmolarity system 
on january   we announced that after reviewing and accepting labeling submitted to it by the company  the fda had granted the waiver categorization under clia for the tearlab osmolarity system 
on december  we announced that health canada issued a medical device license for the tearlab osmolarity system 
the health canada license allowed us to immediately begin marketing the system in canada 
on august   we entered into an agreement with a distributor  science with vision  for exclusive distribution of the tearlab osmolarity system in canada 
we began selling products through the canadian distributor in on october  we announced that a unique new current procedural terminology  or cpt  code that will apply to the tearlab osmolarity test had been published by the american medical association  or ama 
the new code became effective january  the new cpt code for the tearlab osmolarity test is  microfluidic analysis utilizing an integrated collection and analysis device  tear osmolarity for microfluidic tear osmolarity of both eyes  report twice 
this code falls under the chemistry sub section of the pathology and laboratory section of the cpt codebook and was listed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule by the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms 
reimbursement by cms was set at per eye and was only available for offices that had a moderate complex clia certificate 
under the clinical laboratory fee schedule listed by cms the reimbursement rate was reduced to and was applicable to a majority of states in the us on december   we announced that cms published instructions for updates to the clinical laboratory fee schedule for  including a revised reimbursement rate for the tearlab osmolarity test  effective january  the payment code of that currently applies to the tearlab osmolarity test will be cross walked or paired with code at current reimbursement rates  payment code would be reimbursed in every state by cms at per eye 
this decision by cms provides level reimbursement for and equal access to the tearlab osmolarity test across all states which was not the case in our success is highly dependent on our ability to increase sales of our testing platform in europe and other countries recognizing the ce mark  in canada where we have a medical device license and with our receipt of the clia waiver early in which will enable us to begin full commercialization efforts in the united states 
meeting these objectives requires that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations 
while our cash of million as of december  may be insufficient to fund our planned operations and our ability to generate increased revenues is uncertain  management believes that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations at current levels for at least the next months 
in spite of having adequate funding at this time we continue to evaluate various financing possibilities 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to meet operational needs  we would be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
results of operations revenues  cost of goods sold and gross margin for the years ended december  in thousands change change revenue cost of goods sold gross margin percentage of total revenues revenues tearlab revenue consists of sales of the tearlab osmolarity system  which is a hand held tear film test for the measurement of tear osmolarity  a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has shown to correlate with ded 
the tearlab osmolarity system consists of the following three components the tearlab disposable  which is a single use microfluidic labcard  the tearlab pen  which is a hand held device that interfaces with the tearlab disposable  and the tearlab reader  which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the tearlab disposable and the tearlab pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator 
having received k approval from the fda in the united states  we have begun selling to customers in the united states who hold clia moderate and high complexity certificates and actively supported and assisted our customers to obtain their moderate complexity clia certificates or provided them with support from certified professionals 
having obtained a clia waiver certificate in early  we will continue to actively support our customers in obtaining their clia waiver documentation which will allow us to sell our product to the approximately  eye care practitioners in the united states that are candidates to operate under a clia waiver certification 
we are working with our established distributors in europe and asia to increase sales 
the ability for re imbursement to be obtained in many of those countries where we have distributors will facilitate our ability to increase sales and stimulate the commercialization process 
in countries where we have distributors  we are supporting physicians in local clinical trials and providing them with the required guidance to understand the relationship between ded and osmolarity and how to manage their patients with objective diagnostic data 
in the united kingdom  we are selling directly to the customer and will monitor the success of this approach to determine whether to expand direct selling on other european and asian countries 
having received a medical device license from health canada in december  we have been selling the tearlab osmolarity systems into canada via a distributor in  and and have established a co operative marketing agreement with amo canada to market our product and support the sale of amo drugs related to ded in canada 
we believe that it is important that eye care professionals in the united states develop a clinical understanding of the tearlab osmolarity system 
in december  we put in place a program to facilitate this education process in which we provide customers with test cards to allow them to perform initial studies to determine the prevalence of dry eye disease in their practices 
as a result of this program  clinical trial costs will increase to reflect the free cards being provided for clinical trial purposes 
during the years ended december   and  the company recognized revenue from the sale of tearlab equipment and test cards of   and  respectively 
cost of goods sold tearlab cost of sales includes costs of goods sold  warranty  and royalty costs 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs for the manufacture of the tearlab test  including the costs we incur for the purchase of component parts from our suppliers  applicable freight and shipping costs  fees related to warehousing and logistics inventory management 
also included in tearlab costs of goods sold for the year ended december  was the inventory reserve provision for excess inventory of  while in the year ended december  the inventory reserve provision was not material 
there were no inventory reserve costs or recoveries in the year ended december  gross margin during fiscal as compared with fiscal  our combined gross margin percentage increased from to primarily due to the recording of a  excess inventory reserve in the year ended december   offset by higher level of north american sales volume 
in the year ended december   there was a recovery of excess inventory reserves of  and increased north american sales volume primarily due to three year commitment contracts where upfront costs reduce initial margins on these contracts 
during fiscal as compared with fiscal  our combined gross margin decreased from to primarily due to a recording of a  excess inventory reserve in the year ended december  offset by a higher level of north american sales volume over the year ended december  did not include inventory reserve costs or recoveries 
operating expenses for the years ended december  in thousands change change amortization of intangible assets general and administrative clinical  regulatory and research and development sales and marketing total operating expenses amortization of intangible assets amortization expense of intangible assets remained unchanged for the years ended december    and  as there were no adjustments to the company s cost basis or estimated useful life of the underlying assets 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal employee salary expense increased by  including a non cash clia bonus accrual increase of  related to the increased market value of tearlab s shares  non cash stock option costs increased by  fees related to corporate activities increased by  adminstrative costs increased by  general and administrative expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal employee salary expense increased by  including a clia bonus accrual of  professional fees related to various corporate activities increased by  and were offset by non cash stock option expense which decreased by  in the current year 
we are continuing to focus our efforts on controlling costs by reviewing and improving upon our existing business processes and cost structure 
clinical  regulatory and research and development clinical  regulatory and research and development expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal non cash stock options expense increased by  employee related costs increased by  including a non cash clia bonus accrual increase of  related to the increased market value of tearlab s shares  increased product development costs of  increased clinical trial costs in of  offset by lower professional fees of  regarding regulatory and clinical activities 
clinical  regulatory and research and development expenses decreased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal non cash stock options expense related to consultants decreased by  along with a one time credit for clinical trials of  employee related compensation and bonus costs increased by  including a clia bonus accrual of 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal  non cash stock options expenses increased by  employee related costs increased by  including a non cash clia bonus accrual increase of  related to the increased market value of tearlab s shares primarily due to the transition from a contracted sales force to an internal tearlab sales team  associated increased internal travel costs of  increased advertising and marketing costs of  and increased administrative costs of  consistent with increased commercialization efforts in the united states 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  or during the year ended december   as compared with fiscal driven by the company s commercialization efforts in the united states 
the increase is due to  in sales and business development costs associated with the commercialization of the tearlab product in the united states that were not present in the prior year 
additionally there was a net  increase in marketing advertising and travel expense  reflecting additional marketing production and trade show activity over the prior year period 
also there was an accrual of  related to the clia bonus 
the cornerstone of our sales and marketing strategy to date has been to increase awareness of our products among eye care professionals and  in particular  the key opinion leaders in the eye care professions 
we assist key opinion leaders in performing clinical trials to generate increased data to provide an increased understanding in the use of the tearlab osmolarity system for diagnostic  treatment and monitoring of patients 
presently we are expanding our commercialization efforts in north america  europe  and asia 
we will continue to develop and execute our conference and podium strategy to ensure visibility and evidence based positioning of the tearlab osmolarity system among eye care professionals 
other income expense  net for the years ended december  in thousands change change interest income changes in fair value of warrant obligation warrant issue costs interest expense amortization of financing costs and beneficial conversion features other expense interest income interest income consists of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents 
the fluctuations in interest income during years ended december   and  are due to fluctuations in the company s average cash and variations in average interest rates 
changes in fair value of warrant obligation for the year ended december  the company recorded an expense of  related to changes in the fair value of warrant obligations  while recording income of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
at january   the company had a total of  warrants subject to fair value re measurement each quarter 
during the first quarter of certain holders of warrants exercised  warrants 
the company is required to record the outstanding warrants at fair value at the time of exercise  resulting in an adjustment to the warrant obligations  with any gain or loss recorded in earnings of the applicable reporting period 
the company  therefore  estimated the fair value of the exercised warrants during the first quarter to be  an increase of  from the previous value at december  this increase was recorded as a charge to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended march  during the second quarter of certain holders of warrants exercised  warrants 
the company estimated the fair value of the exercised warrants during the second quarter to be  an increase of  from the previous value at march  this increase was recorded as a charge to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended june  in addition  the company is also required to record the outstanding warrants at fair value at the end of each reporting period  resulting in an adjustment to the warrant obligations  with any gain or loss recorded in earnings of the applicable reporting period 
the company  therefore  estimated the fair value of the remaining warrants as of december  to be  an increase of  from the previous value at december  these amounts were recorded as a charge to other income expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december   the primary driver of this change being a change in black scholes valuation inputs for our increased stock price 
a decrease of  and  at december  and  respectively  in the fair value of warrant obligations are recorded as a gain in other income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense in the third quarter of  the company closed an agreement with certain investors whereby the investors agreed to provide financing  or the financing  to the company through the purchase of convertible secured notes  in the aggregate amount of million 
the convertible secured notes  or the notes  evidencing the financing  were to mature on the second anniversary of their issuance  bearing interest at a rate of per annum and were convertible into shares of the company s common stock upon the request of holders of or more of the outstanding principal amount of the notes at any time after august  and prior to maturity 
on june   the notes were converted to common stock  with interest expense of   and  recorded for the years ended december    and  respectively 
amortization of finance costs as a result of the financing that the company completed in july and august  or the financing  and which resulted in the purchase of million in convertible secured notes by the investors  or the notes  investors were in a position to convert the notes at a conversion price of per share at a time when the common shares of the company were trading at july th and august st providing them with a beneficial conversion feature 
the company valued this feature as  and the amortization of this amount was expensed over the term of the notes until conversion in june as such  amortization expense for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
investors in the financing received  warrants at an exercise price of upon conversion of the notes 
the company valued these warrants using the black scholes value model at a value of  the amortization of this amount was recorded over the term of the notes until they were converted in june and amounted to   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
issuance costs of the financing totaled  and have been allocated to cost of equity and to deferred finance charges 
the amortization of deferred finance charges was recorded over the term of the notes until they were converted in june and amounted to   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
other income expense other expense for the year ended december  consists primarily of foreign exchange loss of  due to exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
other expense for the year ended december  consists primarily of foreign exchange loss of  due to exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions  along with a one time adjustment of  related to an assessment by a canadian government entity 
other expense for the year ended december  consists primarily of foreign exchange loss of  due to exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions  offset by a gain totaling  for the disposal of fixed assets 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents percentage of total assets working capital deficiency financial condition management believes that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations at current levels for at least the next months 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to whether government and third party payers agree to reimburse the tearlab osmolarity system  whether eye care professionals engage in the process of obtaining their clia waiver certification  the costs and timing of building the infrastructure to market and sell the tearlab osmolarity system  the cost and results of continuing development of tearlab corp 
s tearlab osmolarity system  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
our purchases of test cards are in australian dollars and fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and australian dollar may be material 
in  exchange rate incurred to purchase australian dollar to pay our australian supplier fluctuated from usd to usd per aud 
at the present time  our only product is the tearlab osmolarity system  and although we have received k approval from the fda and a clia waiver approval from the fda  at this time  we do not know when we can expect to begin to generate significant revenues from the tearlab osmolarity system in the united states 
we believe that we have sufficient funding to meet operational needs until the company becomes cash flow positive from operations but if we are not able to achieve a cash positive operating position in the future we may need to raise additional funds  and our prospects for obtaining that capital are uncertain 
additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in addition  future financings could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders 
ongoing sources and uses of cash we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from increased revenues  will be sufficient to sustain our operations for at least the next months 
we continually evaluate various financing possibilities but we typically expect our primary sources of cash will be related to the collection of accounts receivable and  to a lesser degree  interest income on our cash balances 
our accounts receivable collections will be impacted by our ability to grow our point of care revenue 
we expect our primary uses of cash will be to fund our operating expenses and pursuing and maintaining our patents and trademarks 
in addition  dependent on available funds  we expect to expend cash to improve production capability of the tearlab test  to further improve the performance of the tearlab test  and to pursue additional applications for the lab on a chip technology 
changes in cash flows years ended december  in thousands change change cash used in operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the year cash used in operating activities net cash used to fund our operating activities during the year ended december  was  which is lower than our net loss of  primarily due to non cash charges 
the non cash charges which comprise a portion of the net loss during that period consist primarily of the amortization of intangible assets  fixed assets  patents and trademarks  non cash bonuses paid in common shares and stock based compensation expense in the aggregate total of  net cash used to fund our operating activities during the year ended december  was  which is lower than our net loss of  primarily due to non cash charges 
the non cash charges which comprise a portion of the net loss during that period consist primarily of the amortization of intangible assets  fixed assets  patents and trademarks  accrued interest on the convertible debt funding  amortization of deferred financing charges  warrants beneficial conversion values  advisory fees paid in common shares and stock based compensation expense in the aggregate total of  offset partially by income arising from the revaluation of obligation under warrants of  the net loss was increased by cash costs of  for issue costs of warrants in the june private placement financing 
the net change in non cash working capital and non current asset balances related to operations for the years ended december   and consists of the following in thousands accounts receivable due from related parties inventory prepaid expenses other current assets other non current assets accounts payable accrued liabilities deferred revenue due to stockholders explanations of the more significant net changes in working capital and non current asset balances are as follows accounts receivable increased in  and as a result of increased revenues in  and related to sales of the tearlab osmolarity system 
inventory increased in each of  and primarily due to the increase in inventory purchases to support the projected ramp up in commercialization of the tearlab products 
prepaid expenses increased in from and decreased in from primarily due to the timing of annual payments made  termination of prepaid advisory agreements and reduced prepaid insurance costs 
non current assets increased in from in reflecting a security deposit on premises to be leased in which will be outstanding for greater than months 
accounts payable movement year over year is primarily due to the timing of payment cycles and the increase in commercial activities 
accrued liabilities have increased in each of and as a result of the clia bonus accrued as a result of the tearlab achieving clia waiver status for the tearlab osmolarity system resulting in a significant increase in operational activity offset by the payment of advisory agreement fees in and increased in primarily as a result of increased accruals for amounts due to employees and increased levels of operations in line with increased commercialization efforts 
decrease in deferred revenue in  and arose from the amortization of licensing fees and from the shipment of product previously paid for 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively  used to acquire fixed assets  net of disposals 
cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and is primarily made up of  raised during from the issuance common stock in a public offering   raised during in a registered direct offering both offset by costs incurred in these transactions of  as well as  raised as a result of warrant exercises and  raised as a result of option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and is made up primarily of  raised during from the issuance of common stock in a pipe transaction  offset by  in financing fees and fees for services related to the pipe transaction 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  and is made up primarily of  raised during from the issuance of common stock in a pipe transaction and the  raised from the issuance of common stock in a registered direct fundraising  offset by  in financing fees and fees for services related to the pipe and registered direct transactions 
in addition  there was  in funds related to the exercise of options 
borrowings as of december   we had a balance of  in convertible notes payable and accrued interest arising from an agreement with investors in july and august of  as described in note in the notes to the financial statements 
the convertible notes payable and accrued interest were converted into common shares in the second quarter of there are no other outstanding long term debt or balances available under credit agreements 
contractual obligations and contingencies the following table in thousands summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  and the effect those commitments are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period total less than year to years more than years purchase commitments operating leases royalty payments total purchase commitment obligations represent our contractually obligated minimum purchase requirements as outlined in a manufacturing and development agreement for test cards for the company 
the agreement is denominated in aud and as such actual amounts paid in usd may differ 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our intangible assets  uncollectible receivables  inventories  debt and equity instruments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognizable are deferred 
subsequent to its launch in the fourth quarter of  the company s revenues have been derived from sales of the tearlab osmolarity system for ded which consists of hardware and related disposables 
the company s sales are currently to countries in north america  europe  and asia  and are generally transacted through distributors outside of the united states 
the company records revenue when all of its obligations are completed which is generally upon shipment of the company s products 
in  the majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of disposable test cards and we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we loan our proprietary tearlab systems at no cost to our customers  who are primarily eye care professionals  who in turn purchase the disposable test cards for use in osmolarity testing procedures 
in addition  we place our proprietary systems with our customers for an extended period at no up front cost to them 
our disposable test cards are currently shipped from our primary distribution and warehousing operations facility located in frederick  colorado 
we generally recognize revenue for disposables test cards when the test cards are shipped to the customers 
the company enters into contracts where revenue is derived from multiple deliverables containing a mix of products  which generally includes either the sale or the right to use a tearlab osmolarity system and sales of a fixed number of test cards 
the company either sells readers and test cards as a combined unit with no future commitments on behalf of the client or allows the customer to use the readers with a commitment to fulfill a minimum purchase obligation  typically over a three year period 
revenue recognition for contracts with multiple deliverables is based on the individual units of accounting determined to exist in the contract 
a delivered item is considered a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
items are considered to have stand alone value when they are sold separately by any vendor or when the customer could resell the item on a stand alone basis 
considering that test cards are essential to the operation of a tearlab reader  there is no alternative vendor for the test cards and no indication that a secondary market for the tearlab readers is established  the deliverables under the contracts entered into during and do not meet criteria for separation under the multiple element arrangements guidance 
consideration is allocated at the inception of the contract to all deliverables based on their relative selling price 
the relative selling price for each deliverable is determined using vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price or third party evidence of selling price if vsoe does not exist 
if neither vsoe nor third party evidence exists  the company uses its best estimate of the selling price for the deliverable 
the company recognizes revenue for each of the elements only when it determines that all applicable recognition criteria have been met 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and are generally unsecured and due within days 
the company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
expected credit losses related to trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the allowance for doubtful accounts is charged to sales and marketing expense and accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
the carrying value of accounts receivable approximates their fair value due to their short term nature 
to date  charges for bad debt expense have not been material 
inventory valuation and reserves inventory is recorded at the lower of cost based on first in  first out basis or market and consists of finished goods 
inventory is periodically reviewed for evidence of slow moving or obsolete items  and the estimated reserve is based on management reviews of inventories on hand  compared to estimated future usage and sales  reviewing product shelf life  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
the company has entered into a long term purchase commitment to buy the test cards from minifab 
the purchase commitment contains required minimum annual purchases 
as part of our consideration of excess or obsolete inventory  the company considers future annual minimum purchases  estimated future usage and the expiry dating of the cards in its analysis of any inventory reserve needed 
the usage of the minimum purchase commitment is predicated upon significant increases in revenues from tearlab products as compared to and prior years 
as of december   and  we had inventory reserves of   and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of   and  respectively  and recovery of   and  respectively 
at december   we estimated that we would fully utilize the minimum commitment of cards and that a provision for future loss was not required 
valuation of intangible and other long lived assets 
we periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined by a combination of third party sources and discontinued cash flows 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
at december   the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled  and the net book value of fixed assets totaled  we determined that  as of december  and  there have been no significant events which may have affected the carrying value of tearlab technology 
however  our prior history of losses and losses incurred during the current fiscal year reflects a potential indication of impairment  thus requiring management to assess whether tearlab research  inc technology was impaired as of december  and based on management estimates of forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of december  and  we concluded that there was no indication of an impairment of the tearlab technology in either fiscal period 
stock based compensation we use the fair value method to account for share based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance for stock compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
the company computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
due to the lack of sufficient historical data  the company computation of expected life was estimated using the short cut approach as provided in sab no 
as options granted by the company meet the criteria of plain vanilla options as defined in sab no 
under this approach  estimated life is calculated to be the mid point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual period 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance on stock compensation using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
warrant liabilities the company issued several rounds of warrants related to various debt and equity transactions that occurred in  and the company accounts for its warrants issued in accordance with us gaap accounting guidance under asc applicable to derivative instruments  which requires every derivative instrument within its scope to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
based on this guidance  the company determined that the company warrants do not meet the criteria for classification as equity 
accordingly  the company classified the warrants as current liabilities 
the warrants are subject to remeasurement at each balance sheet date  with any change in fair value recognized as a component of other income expense  net in the statements of operations 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option pricing model as described in the stock based compensation section above  based on the estimated market value of the underlying common stock at the valuation measurement date  the remaining contractual term of the warrant  risk free interest rates and expected dividends on and expected volatility of the price of the underlying common stock
