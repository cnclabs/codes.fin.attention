table of contents design and engineering our global e c group provides a broad range of engineering and design related services 
our design and engineering capabilities include process  civil  structural  architectural  mechanical  instrumentation  electrical  and health  safety and environmental management 
for each project  we identify the project requirements and then integrate and coordinate the various design elements 
other critical tasks in the design process may include engineering to optimize costs  risk and hazard reviews  and the assessment of construction  maintenance and operational requirements 
project management and project control our global e c group offers a wide range of project management and project control services for overseeing engineering  procurement and construction activities 
these services include estimating costs  project planning and project cost control 
the provision of these services is an integral part of the planning  design and construction phases of projects that we execute directly for clients 
we also provide these services to our clients in the role of project management or program management consultant  where we oversee  on our client s behalf  the execution by other contractors of all or some of the planning  design and construction phases of a project 
procurement our procurement activities focus on those projects where we also execute the design and engineering work 
we manage the procurement of materials  subcontractors and craft labor 
often  we purchase materials  equipment and third party services on behalf of our client  where the client will pay for the purchased items or services at cost and reimburse us the cost of the associated services plus a margin or fee 
construction commissioning and start up our global e c group provides construction and construction management services on a worldwide basis 
our construction  commissioning and start up activities focus on those projects where we have performed most of the associated design and engineering work 
depending on the project  we may function as the primary contractor or as a subcontractor to another firm 
on some projects  we function as the construction manager  engaged by the customer to oversee another contractor s compliance with design specifications and contracting terms 
in some instances  we have responsibility for commissioning and plant start up  or  where the client has responsibility for these activities  we provide experts to work as part of our client s team 
operations and maintenance our global e c group provides plant operations and maintenance services  such as repair  renovation  predictive and preventative services and other aftermarket services 
in some instances  our contracts may require us to operate a plant  which we have designed and built  for an initial period that may vary from a very short period to up to approximately two years 
fired heaters our global e c group designs and supplies direct fired furnaces used in a wide range of refining  petrochemical  chemical  oil and gas processes  including fired heaters and waste heat recovery units 
in addition  our global e c group also designs and supplies fired heaters which form an integral part of our proprietary delayed coking and hydrogen production technologies 
our global power group our global power group designs  manufactures and erects steam generators and auxiliary equipment for electric power generating stations  district heating and power plants and industrial facilities worldwide 
we believe that our competitive differentiation in serving these markets is the ability of our products to cleanly and efficiently burn a wide range of fuels  singularly or in combination 
our global power group s steam generators 
table of contents utilize a broad range of technologies  offering independent power producers  utilities  municipalities and industrial clients high value technology solutions for converting a wide range of fuels  such as coal  lignite  petroleum coke  oil  gas  solar  biomass  municipal solid waste and waste flue gases  into steam  which can be used for power generation  district heating or industrial processes 
among these fuel sources  coal is the most widely used  and thus the market drivers and constraints associated with coal strongly affect the steam generator market and our global power group s business 
our global power group also conducts research and development in the areas of combustion  solid  fluid and gas dynamics  heat transfer  materials and solid mechanics 
additionally  our global power group owns and operates a waste to energy facility  holds a controlling interest in and operates a combined cycle gas turbine facility  owns a noncontrolling interest in and operates a petcoke fired circulating fluidized bed  which we refer to as cfb  facility for refinery steam and power generation  and operates a university cogeneration power facility for steam electric generation 
for both our cfb and pulverized coal  which we refer to as pc  steam generators  we offer supercritical once through unit designs to further improve the energy efficiency and  therefore  the environmental performance of these units 
once through supercritical steam generators operate at higher steam temperatures than traditional plants  which results in higher efficiencies and lower emissions  including emissions of carbon dioxide  or co  which is considered a greenhouse gas 
our global power group generates revenues from engineering activities  equipment supply  construction contracts  operating and maintenance agreements  and royalties from licensing its technology 
additionally  our global power group generates equity earnings from returns on its noncontrolling interest investments in various power production facilities 
our global power group s products and services include circulating fluidized bed steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies steam generators that utilize our proprietary cfb technology to clients worldwide 
we believe that cfb combustion is generally recognized as one of the most commercially viable  fuel flexible and clean burning ways to generate steam on a commercial basis from coal and many other solid fuels and waste products 
a cfb steam generator utilizes air nozzles on the floor and lower side walls of its furnace to mix and fluidize the fuel particles as they burn  resulting in a very efficient combustion and heat transfer process 
the fuel and other added solid materials  such as limestone  are continuously recycled through the furnace to maximize combustion efficiency and the capture of pollutants  such as the oxides of sulfur  which we refer to as sox 
due to the efficient mixing of the fuel with the air and other solid materials and the long period of time the fuel remains in the combustion process  the temperature of the process can be greatly reduced below that of a conventional burning process 
this has the added benefit of reducing the formation of nitrogen oxide  which we refer to as nox  which is another pollutant formed during the combustion process 
due to these benefits  additional sox and sox control systems are frequently not needed 
supercritical cfb steam technology dramatically raises the pressure of water as it is converted to steam  allowing the steam to absorb more heat from the combustion process  which results in a substantial improvement of approximately in the efficiency of an electric power plant 
to meet the requirements of the utility power sector  our global power group offers supercritical cfb steam generators that range from megawatt electrical  or mwe  up to mwe in single unit sizes  in addition to subcritical cfb steam generators which typically range between mwe 
we are continuing our development of flexi burn tm technology as a next generation technology to be used with our cfb steam generators at coal power plants  which we believe will significantly decrease co 

emissions 
this technology will enable our cfb steam generators to capture and store co by operating in oxygen firing co 

capture mode  commonly referred to as oxy fuel combustion 
in this mode  the cfb combustion process will produce a co rich flue gas which can then be delivered to a storage location while avoiding the need for large  expensive and energy intensive post combustion co 

separation equipment 
we completed an engineering and supply project for a pilot scale approximately megawatt thermal  equivalent to approximately mwe cfb steam generator  which incorporates our carbon capturing flexi burn tm technology 
the pilot plant began successfully capturing co in september additionally  together with other parties through a grant agree 
table of contents ment with the european commission  we are considering projects to further develop carbon capturing technology 
the grant agreement stipulates that the funding under the program will be used for carbon capture and storage technology development applicable to a mwe oxy fuel combustion power plant 
pulverized coal steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies pc steam generators to clients worldwide 
pc steam generators are commonly used in large coal fired power plant applications 
the coal is pulverized into fine particles and injected into the steam generator through specially designed low nox burners 
our pc steam generators control nox by utilizing advanced nox combustion technology and selective catalytic reduction technology  which we refer to as scr 
pc technology requires flue gas desulfurization  which we refer to as fgd  equipment to be installed to capture sox 
we offer our pc steam generators with either conventional sub critical steam technology or more efficient supercritical steam technology for electric power plant applications 
pc steam generators typically range from mwe 
industrial steam generators our global power group designs  manufactures and supplies industrial steam generators of various types including cfb  as described above  grate  fully assembled package  field erected oil and gas  waste heat  and heat recovery steam generators 
depending on the steam generator type and application  our industrial steam generators are designed to burn a wide spectrum of industrial fuels from high quality oil and natural gas to biomass and waste type fuels such as tires  municipal solid waste  waste wood and paper 
our industrial steam generators are designed for ruggedness  fuel flexibility and reliability 
auxiliary equipment and aftermarket services our global power group also manufactures and installs auxiliary and replacement equipment for utility power and industrial facilities  including steam generators for solar thermal power plants  surface condensers  feed water heaters  coal pulverizers  steam generator coils and panels  biomass gasifiers  and replacement parts 
additionally  we offer a full line of new and retrofit nox reduction systems such as selective non catalytic and catalytic nox reduction systems  as well as complete low nox combustion systems 
our multi pollutant fgd equipment utilizes scrubbing technology to capture sulfur dioxide  or so  and other harmful emissions and has the ability to meet all applicable emission regulations in the us and europe 
during  we acquired a company based in germany that designs  manufactures and installs equipment which utilizes circulating dry ash flue gas scrubbing technology for all types of steam generators in the power and industrial sectors 
this acquisition enhanced our product portfolio 
we provide a broad range of site services relating to these products  including construction and erection services  maintenance engineering  plant upgrading and life extension  and plant repowering 
our global power group also conducts research and development in the areas of combustion  fluid and gas dynamics  heat transfer  materials and solid mechanics 
in addition  our global power group licenses its technology to a limited number of third parties in select countries or markets

table of contents item a 
risk factors amounts in thousands of dollars our business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those described below 
if any of these events occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our securities could decline 
the following discussion of risks relating to our business should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
for additional information regarding forward looking statements  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations safe harbor statement 
the categorization of risks set forth below is meant to help you better understand the risks facing our business and is not intended to limit consideration of the possible effects of these risks to the listed categories 
any adverse effects related to the risks discussed below may  and likely will  adversely affect many aspects of our business 
risks related to our operations the nature of our contracts subjects us to risks related to each project s technical design and associated warranty obligations  changes from original projections for costs and schedules which  particularly with our current and future lump sum or fixed price contracts and other shared risk contracts  may result in significant losses if costs are greater than anticipated and or contractual schedules are not met 
we assume each project s technical risk and associated warranty obligations on all of our contracts and projects  meaning that we must tailor products and systems to satisfy the technical requirements of a project even though  at the time the project is awarded  we may not have previously produced such a product or system 
warranty obligations can range from re performance of engineering services to modification or replacement of equipment 
we also assume the risks related to revenue  cost and gross profit realized on such contracts that can vary  sometimes substantially  from the original projections due to changes in a variety of other factors  including but not limited to engineering design changes  unanticipated technical problems with the equipment being supplied or developed by us  which may require that we spend our own money to remedy the problem  changes in the costs of components  materials or labor  difficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals  changes in local laws and regulations  changes in local labor conditions  project modifications creating unanticipated costs and or delays related to contractual schedules  delays caused by local weather conditions  and our project owners  suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform 
these risks may be exacerbated by the length of time between signing a contract and completing the project because most of the projects that we execute are long term 
the term of our contracts can be as long as approximately four years 
in addition  we sometimes bear the risk of delays caused by unexpected conditions or events 
some of our contracts are fixed price contracts and other shared risk contracts  which are both inherently risky because we agree to the selling price of the project based on estimates at the time we enter into the contract 
the selling price is based on estimates of the ultimate cost of the contract and we assume substantially all of the risks associated with completing the project  as well as the post completion warranty obligations 
certain of these contracts are lump sum turnkey projects where we are responsible for all aspects of the work from engineering through construction  as well as commissioning  all for a fixed selling price 
we may be subject to penalties if portions of the long term fixed price projects are not completed in accordance with agreed upon time limits 

table of contents therefore  significant losses can result from performing large  long term projects on a fixed price or lump sum basis 
these losses may be material  including in some cases up to or exceeding the full contract value in certain events of non performance and or delay  and could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   our backlog included  attributable to lump sum turnkey contracts and  attributable to other fixed price contracts  which represented and  respectively  of our total backlog 
we may increase the size and number of fixed price or lump sum turnkey contracts  sometimes in countries where or with clients with whom we have limited previous experience 
we have and may continue to bid for and enter into such contracts through partnerships or joint ventures with third parties 
these arrangements increase our ability and willingness to bid for increased numbers of contracts and or contracts of increased size 
in some cases  applicable law and joint venture or other agreements may provide that each joint venture partner is jointly and severally liable for all liabilities of the venture 
entering into these partnerships or joint ventures exposes us to credit and performance risks of those third party partners  which could have a negative impact on our business and our results of operations if these parties fail to perform under the arrangements 
our failure to successfully defend against claims made against us by project owners  suppliers or project subcontractors  or our failure to recover adequately on our claims made against project owners  suppliers or subcontractors  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our projects generally involve complex design and engineering  significant procurement of equipment and supplies and construction management 
we may encounter difficulties in the design or engineering  equipment and supply delivery  schedule changes and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that affect our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule or to meet the contractual performance obligations 
in addition  we generally rely on third party partners  equipment manufacturers and subcontractors to assist us with the completion of our contracts 
as such  claims involving project owners  suppliers and subcontractors may be brought against us and by us in connection with our project contracts 
claims brought against us include back charges for alleged defective or incomplete work  breaches of warranty and or late completion of the project work and claims for cancelled projects 
the claims and back charges can involve actual damages  as well as contractually agreed upon liquidated sums 
claims brought by us against project owners include claims for additional costs incurred in excess of current contract provisions arising out of project delays and changes in the previously agreed scope of work 
claims between us and our suppliers  subcontractors and vendors include claims like any of those described above 
these project claims  if not resolved through negotiation  are often subject to lengthy and expensive litigation or arbitration proceedings 
charges associated with claims could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for further information on project claims  please refer to note  litigation and uncertainties  to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
projects included in our backlog may be delayed or cancelled  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the dollar amount of backlog does not necessarily indicate future earnings related to the performance of that work 
backlog refers to expected future revenues under signed contracts and legally binding letters of intent that we have determined are likely to be performed 
backlog represents only business that is considered firm  although cancellations or scope adjustments may and do occur 
because of changes in project scope and schedule  we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be performed or the associated revenue will be recognized 
in addition  even where a project proceeds as scheduled  it is possible that contracted parties may default and fail to pay amounts owed to us 
material delays  cancellations or payment defaults could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents because our operations are concentrated in four particular industries  we may be adversely impacted by economic or other developments in these industries 
we derive a significant amount of revenues from services provided to clients that are concentrated in four industries oil and gas  oil refining  chemical petrochemical and power generation 
these industries historically have been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature 
consequently  our results of operations have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  depending on the demand for our products and services from clients in these industries 
unfavorable developments in global or regional economic growth rates or other unfavorable developments in one or more of these industries could adversely affect our clients investment plans and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
both of our business groups have been impacted by unfavorable economic growth rates in most of their respective global markets during additionally  there is potential downside risk to continued unfavorable global economic growth rates driven primarily by continued sovereign debt and bank funding pressures in the eurozone  the speed at which governmental efforts directed at spending and debt reduction are being implemented  a slowdown in the economic growth rate in china and geopolitical oil supply risks  which could impact global economic growth through a significant rise in oil prices 
if these risks materialize  both of our business groups could be impacted 
global markets in the engineering and construction industry have experienced intense competition among engineering and construction contractors and pricing pressure for contracts awarded 
we have seen instances of protracted client bidding and contract award processes and clients releasing tranches of work on a piecemeal basis 
these factors may continue in the future 
a number of other constraining market factors continue to impact the markets in the power generation industry that our global power group serves 
these factors include political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators  particularly in the us and western europe  as well as the outlook for continued lower natural gas pricing over the next three to five years  which has increased the attractiveness of natural gas  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity 
these factors may continue in the future 
our results of operations and cash flows depend on new contract awards  and the selection process and timing for performing these contracts are not entirely within our control 
a substantial portion of our revenues is derived from new contract awards of projects 
it is difficult to predict whether and when we will receive such awards due to the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process  which is affected by a number of factors  such as market conditions  financing arrangements  governmental approvals and environmental matters 
we often compete with other general and specialty contractors  including large multinational contractors and small local contractors in the global markets in which we operate 
the strong competition in our markets requires us to maintain skilled personnel and invest in technology  and also puts pressure on our profit margins 
because of this  we could be prevented from obtaining contracts for which we have bid due to price  greater perceived financial strength and resources of our competitors and or perceived technology advantages 
alternatively  we may have to agree to lower prices and margins for contracts that we win or we may lose a bid or decide not to pursue a contract if the profit margins are below our minimum acceptable margins based on our risk assessment of the project conditions 
our ability to compete for and receive new contract awards may be further impacted if we are unable to form joint ventures or similar arrangements with other contractors in order to jointly compete for a single contract 
such arrangements can often offer stronger combined qualifications than any firm standing alone and these arrangements can be important to the success of a particular contract bid process or proposal 
these arrangements are particularly effective in certain non us regions where the bidding success can be substantially impacted by the presence and or qualifications of local partners 
the failure to maintain such relationships may impact our ability to receive certain new contract awards 
our results of operations and cash flows can fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of our contract awards 
in addition  certain of these contracts are subject to client financing contingencies and envi 
table of contents ronmental permits  and  as a result  we are subject to the risk that the customer will not be able to secure the necessary financing and approvals for the project  which could result in a delay or cancellation of the proposed project and thereby reduce our revenues and profits 
in addition  our performance is greatly impacted by our ability to utilize our workforce 
we maintain our workforce based on our current and anticipated projects  including expected new contract awards 
if we do not receive new contract awards or if awards are delayed  or if our projects experience changes from estimates related to unanticipated scheduling delays or experience modifications regarding the scope of work to be performed  we may incur significant costs if we cannot reallocate staffing in a timely manner or terminate the employment of excess staffing 
our failure to attract and retain key officers  qualified personnel  joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our ability to attract and retain key officers  qualified engineers and other professional personnel  as well as joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors  will be an important factor in determining our future success 
the market for these professionals is competitive and we may not be successful in efforts to attract and retain these individuals 
failure to attract or retain these key officers  professionals  joint venture partners  advisors and subcontractors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our worldwide operations involve risks that may limit or disrupt operations  limit repatriation of cash  increase taxation or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have worldwide operations  including project site locations  that are conducted through our subsidiaries  as well as through agreements with joint venture partners 
our subsidiaries have operations located in asia  australia  europe  the middle east  north america  south africa and south america and execute projects from their office locations  as well as  at project site locations 
additionally  we purchase materials and equipment on a worldwide basis and are heavily dependent on unrelated third party sources for these materials and equipment 
our worldwide operations and our execution of projects are subject to risks that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  including uncertain political  legal and economic environments  potential incompatibility with joint venture partners  foreign currency controls and fluctuations  energy prices and availability  war and civil disturbances  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  the imposition of additional governmental controls and regulations  labor problems and safety practices  and interruptions to shipping lanes or other methods of transit 
because of these risks  our worldwide operations and our execution of projects may be limited  or disrupted  our contractual rights may not be enforced fully or at all  our taxation may be increased  or we may be limited in repatriating earnings 
these potential events and liabilities could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our projects are located at work sites which are inherently dangerous 
failure to maintain a safe work site could result in harm to employees and others  employee turnover  financial losses and decreased opportunities to participate in future bids 
our project sites can place our employees and others near large equipment  dangerous processes  highly regulated materials or in challenging environments 
depending on the project  we may have the responsibility for safety on the project site and  accordingly  must implement safety procedures 
if we fail to implement such procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective  our employees and others may be harmed 
although we maintain functional groups whose primary purpose is to implement effective health  safety and environmental procedures throughout our company  the failure to comply with such procedures can subject us to losses and liability under client contracts or statutory regulations 
unsafe work sites also have the potential to increase employee turnover  increase the cost of a project to our clients and raise our operating costs 
any of the foregoing could result in financial losses  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we may lose future opportunities to participate in contract bids as many of our clients require that we meet certain safety criteria in order to be eligible to bid on contracts 
it can be very difficult or expensive to obtain insurance coverage for our business operations  and we may not be able to secure or maintain sufficient coverage to satisfy our needs 
as part of our business operations  we maintain insurance coverage both as a corporate risk management strategy and in order to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts 
although we have in the past been able to satisfy our insurance needs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure all necessary or appropriate insurance coverage in the future 
our insurance is purchased from a number of the world s leading providers  often in layered insurance arrangements 
we monitor the financial health of the insurance companies from which we hold policies  and review the financial health of an insurer prior to purchasing a policy 
if any of our third party insurers fail  refuse to renew or revoke coverage or otherwise cannot satisfy their insurance requirements to us  then our overall risk exposure and operational expenses could be increased and our business operations could be interrupted 
we are subject to anti bribery laws in the countries in which we operate 
failure to comply with these laws could result in our becoming subject to penalties and the disruption of our business activities 
many of the countries in which we transact business have laws that restrict the offer or payment of anything of value to government officials or other persons with the intent of gaining business or favorable government action 
we are subject to these laws in addition to being governed by the us foreign corrupt practices act restricting these types of activities 
in addition to prohibiting certain bribery related activity with government officials and other persons  these laws provide for recordkeeping and reporting obligations 
our policies mandate compliance with these anti bribery laws and we have procedures and controls in place to monitor internal and external compliance 
however  any failure by us  our subcontractors  agents or others who work for us on our behalf to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties 
the failure to comply with these legal and regulatory obligations could also disrupt our business activities 
we may be negatively impacted by an increase in our effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of changes in tax laws  treaties or regulations  or their interpretation  of any country in which we operate  the varying mix of income earned in the jurisdictions in which we operate  the realizability of deferred tax assets  including our inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses generated by certain unprofitable operations  cash repatriations decisions  changes in uncertain tax positions and the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation 
an increase in our effective tax rate could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents we continue to assess the impact of various legislative proposals  including us federal and state proposals  and modifications to existing tax treaties  that could result in a material increase in our taxes 
we cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation 
however  if such proposals were to be enacted  or if modifications were to be made to certain existing treaties  the consequences could have a materially adverse impact on us  including increasing our tax burden  increasing costs of our tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our business may be materially adversely impacted by regional  national and or global requirements to significantly limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the future 
greenhouse gases that result from human activities  including burning of fossil fuels  have been the focus of increased scientific and political scrutiny and are being subjected to various legal requirements 
international agreements  national laws  state laws and various regulatory schemes that limit or otherwise regulate emissions measuring and control of greenhouse gases are under consideration by different governmental entities 
we derive a significant amount of revenues and contract profits from engineering and construction services provided to clients that own and or operate a wide range of process plants and from the supply of our manufactured equipment to clients that own and or operate electric power generating plants 
additionally  we own or partially own plants that generate electricity from burning natural gas or various types of solid fuels 
these plants emit greenhouse gases as part of the process to generate electricity or other products 
compliance with the future greenhouse gas regulations may prove costly or difficult 
it is possible that owners and operators of existing or future process plants and electric generating plants could be subject to new or changed environmental regulations that result in increasing the cost of emitting such gases or requiring emissions allowances 
the costs of controlling such emissions or obtaining required emissions allowances could be significant 
it also is possible that necessary controls or allowances may not be available 
such regulations could negatively impact client investments in capital projects in our markets  which could negatively impact the market for our manufactured products and certain of our services  and also could negatively affect the operations and profitability of our own electric power plants 
this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we may incur significant costs and penalties that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing the generation  management and use of regulated materials  the discharge of materials into the environment  the remediation of environmental contamination  or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
both our global e c group and our global power group make use of and produce as wastes or byproducts substances that are considered to be hazardous under these environmental laws and regulations 
we may be subject to liabilities for environmental contamination as an owner or operator or former owner or operator of a facility or as a generator of hazardous substances without regard to negligence or fault  and we are subject to additional liabilities if we do not comply with applicable laws regulating such hazardous substances  and  in either case  such liabilities can be substantial 
these laws and regulations could expose us to liability arising out of the conduct of current and past operations or conditions  including those associated with formerly owned or operated properties caused by us or others  or for acts by us or others which were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
in some cases  we have assumed contractual indemnification obligations for environmental liabilities associated with some formerly owned properties 
the ongoing costs of complying with existing environmental laws and regulations could be substantial 
additionally  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury  property damage or natural resource damages as a result of alleged exposure to or contamination by hazardous substances 
changes in the environmental laws and regulations  remediation obligations  enforcement actions  stricter interpretations of existing requirements  future discovery of contamination or claims for damages to persons  property  natural resources or the environment could result in material costs and liabilities that we currently do not anticipate 

table of contents we may lose future business to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our proprietary products 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights to the technologies and know how used in our proprietary products  including rights which we license to third parties 
we rely on patent protection  as well as a combination of trade secret  unfair competition and similar laws and nondisclosure  confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary technology 
however  these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology 
we cannot provide assurance that we can meaningfully protect all of our rights in our unpatented proprietary technology  or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary products or processes or otherwise gain access to our unpatented proprietary technology 
additionally  we also hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
we rely on our information and communication systems and data in our operations 
failure in the availability or security of our information and communication systems or in data security could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our information and communication systems and our use of our internal data and our clients data  including electronic and hardcopy data formats 
information and communication systems by their nature are susceptible to internal and external security breaches  including computer hacker and cyber terrorist breaches  and can fail or become unavailable for a significant period of time 
additionally  if our data security controls fail  we are at risk of intentionally or unintentionally disclosing our or our clients data  including trade secrets and intellectual property 
this could lead to the violation of client confidentiality agreements and loss of critical data 
while we have implemented internal controls for information and communication systems and data security  there can be no assurance that the unavailability of the information and communication systems  the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of system or data security may not occur which could disrupt our business and could result in decreased performance and increased overhead costs  causing our business and results of operations to suffer 
risks related to our liquidity and capital resources we require cash repatriations from our subsidiaries to meet our cash needs related to our asbestos related and other liabilities  corporate overhead expenses and share repurchases 
our ability to repatriate funds from our subsidiaries is limited by a number of factors 
we are dependent on cash repatriations from our subsidiaries to cover payments and expenses of our parent holding company in switzerland  to cover cash needs related to our asbestos related liability and other overhead expenses in the us and  at our discretion  specific liquidity needs  such as funding acquisitions and our share repurchase program 
there can be no assurance that our forecasted cash repatriations will occur as our subsidiaries need to keep certain amounts available for working capital purposes  to pay known liabilities  to comply with covenants and for other general corporate purposes 
the repatriation of funds may also subject those funds to taxation in some jurisdictions 
the inability to repatriate cash could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
certain of our various debt agreements impose financial covenants  which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities  which could negatively impact our business 
certain of our debt agreements  including our senior unsecured credit agreement  impose financial covenants on us 
these covenants limit our ability to incur indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  make investments and acquisitions  and sell assets 
these limitations may restrict our ability to pursue business opportunities  which could negatively impact our business 

table of contents we may have significant working capital requirements  which if unfunded could negatively impact our business  financial condition and cash flows 
in some cases  we may require significant amounts of working capital to finance the purchase of materials and or the performance of engineering  construction and other work on certain of our projects before we receive payment from our customers 
in some cases  we are contractually obligated to our customers to fund working capital on our projects 
increases in working capital requirements could negatively impact our business  financial condition and cash flows 
additionally  we could temporarily experience a liquidity shortfall if we are unable to access our cash balances and short term investments to meet our working capital requirements 
our cash balances and short term investments are in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions  and some of our deposits exceed available insurance 
the banks or financial institutions in which we hold our cash and short term investments have not gone into bankruptcy or forced receivership  or been seized by their governments 
however  there is a risk that this could occur in the future and that we could temporarily experience a liquidity shortfall or fail to recover our deposits in excess of available insurance 
further significant deterioration of the current global economic and credit market environment  particularly in the eurozone countries  could challenge our efforts to maintain our well diversified asset allocation with creditworthy financial institutions 
in addition  we may invest some of our cash in longer term investment opportunities  including the acquisition of other entities or operations  the reduction of certain liabilities such as unfunded pension liabilities and or repurchases of our outstanding registered shares 
to the extent we use cash for such other purposes  the amount of cash available for the working capital needs described above would be reduced 
our new contract awards  current projects and liquidity may be adversely affected by the availability and or cost of our performance related standby letters of credit  bank guarantees  surety bonds and other guarantee facilities 
consistent with industry practice  we are often required to provide performance related standby letters of credit  bank guarantees  surety bonds or other forms of performance related guarantees to clients  which we refer to as bonds or bonding 
these bonds provide credit support for the client if we fail to perform our obligations under our contract 
a restriction  reduction  termination and or increase in the cost of our bonding facilities may limit our ability to bid on new project awards  delay work on current projects or significantly change the timing of cash flows for current projects  adversely affecting our liquidity 
additionally  in the event our credit ratings are lowered by independent rating agencies  such as standard poor s or moody s investors service  it may be more difficult or costly for us to obtain bonding for new awards or maintain such bonding on current projects 
we may also be required to provide or increase cash collateral to obtain these bonds  which would reduce our available cash and could impact our ability to increase availability under our senior unsecured credit agreement or other bonding facilities 
we are also subject to the risk that any new or amended bonding facilities might not be on terms as favorable as those we have currently  which could adversely affect our liquidity 
we may invest in longer term investment opportunities  such as the acquisition of other entities or operations in the engineering and construction industry or power industry 
acquisitions of other entities or operations have risks that could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have completed and are exploring possible acquisitions within the engineering and construction industry to strategically complement or expand on our technical capabilities or access to new market segments 
we also have completed and may explore possible acquisitions within the power industry to complement our product offerings 
the acquisition of companies and assets in the engineering and construction and power industries is subject to substantial risks  including the failure to identify material problems during due diligence  the risk of over paying for assets and the inability to arrange financing for an acquisition as may be required or desired 

table of contents further  the identification  negotiation  integration and consolidation of acquisitions require substantial human  financial and other resources including management time and attention  and ultimately  our acquisitions may not be successfully completed or integrated and or our resources may be diverted 
additionally  in order to fund targeted acquisitions or other activities  we may issue additional equity securities  which would have the effect of diluting our earnings per share and existing shareholders percentage ownership 
there can be no assurances that we will consummate any such future acquisitions  that any acquisitions we make will perform as expected or that the returns from such acquisitions will support the investment paid to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them 
risks related to asbestos claims the number and cost of our current and future asbestos claims in the united states could be substantially higher than we have estimated and the timing of payment of claims could be sooner than we have estimated  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in numerous lawsuits and out of court administrative claims pending in the united states in which the plaintiffs claim damages for alleged bodily injury or death arising from exposure to asbestos in connection with work performed  or heat exchange devices assembled  installed and or sold  by our subsidiaries 
we expect these subsidiaries to be named as defendants in similar suits and that new claims will be filed in the future 
for purposes of our financial statements  we have estimated the indemnity and defense costs to be incurred in resolving pending and forecasted us claims through although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the actual number of future claims brought against us and the cost of resolving these claims could be substantially higher than our estimates 
some of the factors that may result in the costs of asbestos claims being higher than our current estimates include the rate at which new claims are filed  the number of new claimants  changes in the mix of diseases alleged to be suffered by the claimants  such as type of cancer  asbestosis or other illness  increases in legal fees or other defense costs associated with asbestos claims  increases in indemnity payments  decreases in the proportion of claims dismissed with zero indemnity payments  indemnity payments being required to be made sooner than expected  bankruptcies of other asbestos defendants  causing a reduction in the number of available solvent defendants and thereby increasing the number of claims and the size of demands against our subsidiaries  adverse jury verdicts requiring us to pay damages in amounts greater than we expect to pay in settlements  changes in legislative or judicial standards that make successful defense of claims against our subsidiaries more difficult  or enactment of federal legislation requiring us to contribute amounts to a national settlement trust in excess of our expected net liability  after insurance  in the tort system 
the total liability recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  is based on estimated indemnity and defense costs expected to be incurred through we believe that it is likely that there will be new claims filed after  but in light of uncertainties inherent in long term forecasts  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate the indemnity and defense costs that might be incurred after our forecast contemplates that the number of new claims requiring indemnity will decline from year to year 
if future claims fail to decline as we expect  our aggregate liability for asbestos claims will be higher than estimated 

table of contents we have worked with analysis  research planning corporation  or arpc  nationally recognized consultants in the united states with respect to projecting asbestos liabilities  to estimate the amount of asbestos related indemnity and defense costs at each year end based on a year forecast 
each year we have recorded our estimated asbestos liability at a level consistent with arpc s reasonable best estimate 
arpc reviews our asbestos indemnity payments  defense costs and claims activity and compares them to our year forecast prepared at the previous year end 
based on its review  arpc may recommend that the assumptions used to estimate our future asbestos liability be updated  as appropriate 
our forecast of the number of future claims is based  in part  on an analysis of future disease incidence and  in part  on a regression model  which employs the statistical analysis of our historical claims data to generate a trend line for future claims 
although we believe this forecast method is reasonable  other forecast methods that attempt to estimate the population of living persons who could claim they were exposed to asbestos at worksites where our subsidiaries performed work or sold equipment could also be used and might project higher numbers of future claims than our forecast 
the actual number of future claims  the mix of disease types and the amounts of indemnity and defense costs may exceed our current estimates 
we update our forecasts at least annually to take into consideration recent claims experience and other developments  such as legislation and litigation outcomes  that may affect our estimates of future asbestos related costs 
the announcement of increases to asbestos liabilities as a result of revised forecasts  adverse jury verdicts or other negative developments involving asbestos litigation or insurance recoveries may cause the value or trading prices of our securities to decrease significantly 
these negative developments could also negatively impact our liquidity  cause us to default under covenants in our indebtedness  cause our credit ratings to be downgraded  restrict our access to capital markets or otherwise materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the failure by our us subsidiaries to obtain current and future asbestos related insurance recoveries could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the asbestos related asset recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  represents our best estimate of insurance recoveries from settled and expected future insurance recoveries relating to our us liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims through over the last several years  certain of our subsidiaries have entered into settlement agreements calling for insurers to make lump sum payments  as well as payments over time  for use by our subsidiaries to fund asbestos related indemnity and defense costs and  in certain cases  for reimbursement for portions of out of pocket costs previously incurred 
our subsidiaries have reached agreements with certain of their insurers to settle their disputed asbestos related insurance coverage 
as a result of these settlements  we increased our asbestos related insurance recovery assets and recorded settlement gains 
however  certain of the settlements with insurance companies during the past several years were for fixed dollar amounts that do not change as the liability changes 
accordingly  increases in the asbestos related liabilities would not result in an equal increase in the insurance recovery assets and we would have to fund the difference  which would reduce our cash flows and working capital 
additionally  our ability to continue to recover under these insurance policies is also dependent upon the financial solvency of our insurers 
our insurance recoveries may be limited by future insolvencies among our insurers 
we have not assumed recovery in the estimate of our asbestos related insurance recovery assets from any of our currently insolvent insurers 
other insurers may become insolvent in the future and our insurers may fail to reimburse amounts owed to us on a timely basis 
if we fail to realize expected insurance recoveries  or experience delays in receiving material amounts from our insurers  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents a number of asbestos related claims have been received by our subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
to date  these claims have been substantially covered by insurance policies and proceeds from the policies have been paid directly to the plaintiffs 
the timing and amount of asbestos claims that may be made in the future  the financial solvency of the insurers and the amounts that may be paid to resolve the claims are uncertain 
the insurance carriers failure to make payments due under the policies could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
some of our subsidiaries in the united kingdom have received claims alleging personal injury arising from exposure to asbestos in connection with work performed  or heat exchange devices assembled  installed and or sold  by our subsidiaries 
we expect these subsidiaries to be named as defendants in additional suits and claims brought in the future 
to date  insurance policies have provided coverage for substantially all of the costs incurred in connection with resolving asbestos claims in the united kingdom 
in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   the total of our uk asbestos related insurance recovery assets substantially covers the total of our uk asbestos related liabilities  which are comprised of an estimated liability relating to open outstanding claims and an estimated liability relating to future unasserted claims through our ability to continue to recover under these insurance policies is dependent upon  among other things  the timing and amount of asbestos claims that may be made in the future  the financial solvency of our insurers and the amounts that may be paid to resolve the claims 
these factors could significantly limit our insurance recoveries  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
risks related to our financial reporting and corporate governance our use of the percentage of completion accounting method could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
a substantial portion of our operating revenues  cost of operating revenues and contract profit are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of accounting  the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
revisions to estimated revenues and estimated costs can and do result in changes to previously reported revenues  costs and profits

an impairment of all or part of our goodwill and or our intangible assets could materially adversely impact our results of operations and shareholders equity 
as of december   we had goodwill of  and other intangible assets  net of  on our consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
presently  goodwill exists in four of our reporting units one within our global power group business segment and three within our global e c group business segment 
in the fourth quarter of each year  we evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit based on assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and assess recoverability  and impairments  if any  which are recognized in earnings 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment together with other tangible long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
an impairment of all or a significant part of our goodwill and or intangible assets could materially adversely impact our results of operations and shareholders equity 

table of contents registered holders who acquired our shares after our redomestication to switzerland must apply for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights in order to have voting rights  we may deny such registration under certain circumstances 
to be able to exercise voting rights  registered holders of our shares who acquired our shares after our redomestication to switzerland in must apply to us for enrollment in our share register as shareholders with voting rights 
our board of directors may refuse to register holders of shares as shareholders with voting rights based on certain grounds 
in particular  under our articles of association  no shareholder will be registered with voting rights for or more of our share capital as recorded in the commercial register unless determined otherwise by our board of directors  subject to exceptions for cede co 
and other nominees of clearing organizations 
only shareholders that are registered as shareholders with voting rights on the relevant record date are permitted to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting 
registered holders who received our shares as a result of our redomestication to switzerland were registered as shareholders with voting rights and shareholders who hold in street name will be entitled to participate in and vote at a general shareholders meeting through cede co 
there are provisions in our articles of association that may reduce the voting rights of our registered shares 
our articles of association provide that shareholders have one vote for each registered share held by them and are entitled to vote at all meetings of shareholders 
however  our articles of association provide that shareholders whose controlled shares as defined in the articles of association represent or more of our total voting shares are limited to voting one vote less than of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the commercial register 
this provision is intended to prevent the possibility of our company becoming a controlled foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes  which could have certain adverse us federal income tax consequences to us persons who own directly  indirectly or under applicable constructive ownership rules or more of our voting shares 
it may also have an anti takeover effect by making it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
under our articles of association  our board of directors has the authority to interpret and grant exceptions to this provision 
our status as a swiss corporation may limit our flexibility with respect to certain aspects of capital management 
swiss law allows our shareholders to authorize share capital that can be issued by the board of directors without further shareholder approval 
such authorization is limited to percent of the issued share capital and expires after two years at the latest and must therefore be renewed by our shareholders every two years 
additionally  subject to specified exceptions  including exceptions explicitly described in our articles of association  swiss law grants preemptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares 
swiss law also does not provide as much flexibility in the various terms that can attach to different classes of shares as the laws of some other jurisdictions 
in the event we need to raise share capital at a time when the trading price of our shares is below the chf equivalent to us  based on a foreign exchange rate of chf to us on december  par value of the shares  we will need to obtain the approval of our shareholders to decrease the par value of our issued shares or issue another class of shares with a lower par value 
any reduction in par value would decrease our par value available for future repayment of share capital not subject to swiss withholding tax 
in addition  we will not be able to issue options under our various compensation and benefit plans with an exercise price below the par value  which could limit the flexibility of our compensation arrangements 
swiss law also reserves for approval by shareholders many corporate actions over which a board of directors would have authority in some other jurisdictions 
for example  dividends must be approved by shareholders 
these swiss law requirements relating to our capital management may limit our flexibility  and situations may arise where greater flexibility would have provided substantial benefits to our shareholders 

table of contents if we elect to declare dividends  we would be required to declare such dividends in swiss francs and any currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the swiss franc will affect the dollar value of the dividends we pay 
under swiss corporate law  if we elect to declare dividends  including distributions through a reduction in par value  we would be required to declare such dividends in swiss francs 
dividend payments will be made by our transfer agent in us dollars converted at the applicable exchange rate shortly before the payment date 
as a result  shareholders will be exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the date used for purposes of calculating the chf amount of any proposed dividend or par value reduction and the relevant payment date  which will not be shorter than two months and could be as long as a year 
we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding tax 
if we are not successful in our efforts to make distributions  if any  through a reduction of par value or pay dividends  if any  out of qualifying additional paid in capital  then any dividends paid by us will generally be subject to a swiss federal withholding tax at a rate of 
the withholding tax must be withheld from the gross distribution and paid to the swiss federal tax administration 
a us tax resident shareholder that qualifies for benefits under the convention between the united states of america and the swiss confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income  which we refer to as the us swiss treaty  may apply for a refund of the tax withheld in excess of the treaty rate or in excess of the reduced treaty rate for qualifying corporate shareholders with at least participation in our voting stock  or for a full refund in the case of qualified pension funds 
capital distribution payments in the form of a par value reduction or payment of a dividend out of qualifying additional paid in capital are not subject to swiss withholding tax 
however  there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying additional paid in capital  that we will be able to meet the other legal requirements for a reduction in par value or a dividend out of qualifying additional paid in capital  or that swiss withholding rules will not be changed in the future 
in addition  over the long term  the amount of par value available for us to use for par value reductions will be limited 
if we are unable to make a distribution through a reduction in par value or pay a dividend out of qualifying additional paid in capital  we may not be able to make distributions without subjecting our shareholders to swiss withholding taxes 
we have anti takeover provisions in our articles of association that  together with certain provisions under swiss corporate law  may discourage a change of control 
our articles of association and swiss law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions provide for our board of directors to be divided into three classes serving staggered three year terms 
in addition  directors may be removed from office  by the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the votes cast at the applicable shareholders meeting 
these provisions of our articles of association may delay or limit the ability of a shareholder to obtain majority representation on the board of directors 
limiting the voting rights of shareholders whose controlled shares as defined in the articles of association represent or more of our total voting shares to one vote less than of the total voting rights of our share capital as registered with the swiss commercial register 
under swiss corporate law  merger and demerger transactions require the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the shares represented at the applicable shareholders meeting 
in addition  under certain circumstances for example  in the case of so called cashout or squeezeout mergers a merger requires the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of shares 
any shareholder who wishes to propose any business or to nominate a person or persons for election as a director at any annual meeting may only do so if advance notice is given to our corporate secretary 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if the third party s offer may be considered beneficial by many shareholders 
as a result  shareholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares 

table of contents we are a swiss company and it may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
foster wheeler ag is a swiss corporation 
as a result  the rights of our shareholders are governed by swiss law and by our articles of association and organizational regulations 
the rights of shareholders under swiss law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies of other jurisdictions 
a substantial portion of our assets are located outside the united states 
it may be difficult for investors to enforce in the united states judgments obtained in us courts against us or our directors based on the civil liability provisions of the us securities laws 
uncertainty exists as to whether courts in switzerland will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including in the united states  under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in switzerland under the securities laws of other jurisdictions

the global markets in which we operate are largely dependent on overall economic conditions and global or regional economic growth rates and the resultant demand for oil and gas  electric power  petrochemicals and refined products 
both of our business groups have been impacted by unfavorable economic growth rates in most of their respective global markets during additionally  there is potential downside risk to continued unfavorable global economic growth rates driven primarily by continued sovereign debt and bank funding pressures in the eurozone  the speed at which governmental efforts directed at spending and debt reduction are being implemented  a slowdown in the economic growth rate in china and geopolitical oil supply risks  which could impact global economic growth through a significant rise in oil prices 
if these risks materialize  both of our business groups could be impacted 
in the engineering and construction industry  we expect long term demand to be strong for the end products produced by our clients  and we believe that this long term demand will continue to stimulate investment by our clients in new  expanded and upgraded facilities 
our clients plan their investments based on long term time horizons 
we believe that global demand for energy  chemicals and pharmaceuticals will continue to grow over the long term and that clients will continue to invest in new and upgraded capacity to meet that demand 
global markets in the engineering and construction industry have experienced intense competition among engineering and construction contractors and pricing pressure for contracts awarded 
we have seen instances of protracted client bidding and contract award processes and clients releasing tranches of work on a piecemeal basis 
however  we are seeing clients continuing to develop new projects and  after making final investment decisions  moving forward with previously planned projects 
the challenges and drivers for our global e c group are discussed in more detail in the section entitled results of operations business segments global e c group overview of segment  within this item the demand for the products and services of our global power group was negatively impacted during due to an increased level of timing delays related to project award dates 
however  we believe opportunities will continue in the growth regions of asia  the middle east and south america driven by growing electricity demand 
a number of constraining market factors continue to impact the markets that we serve 
these factors include political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators  particularly in the us and western europe  as well as the outlook for continued lower natural gas pricing over the next three to five years  which has increased the attractiveness of natural gas  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity 
these

provision for income taxes amount change change effective tax rate although we are a swiss corporation  we are listed on a us exchange  therefore  we reconcile our effective tax rate to the us federal statutory rate of to facilitate meaningful comparison with peer companies in the us capital markets 
our effective tax rate can fluctuate significantly from period to period and may differ considerably from the us federal statutory rate as a result of i income taxed in various non us jurisdictions with rates different from the us statutory rate  ii our inability to recognize a tax benefit for losses generated by certain unprofitable operations  and iii the varying mix of income earned in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
in periods when operating units subject to a valuation allowance generate pretax earnings  the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance favorably impacts our effective tax rate 
conversely  in periods when operating units subject to a valuation allowance generate pretax losses  the corresponding increase in the valuation allowance has an unfavorable impact on our effective tax rate

we monitor the jurisdictions for which valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were established in previous years  and we evaluate  on a quarterly basis  the need for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions

please refer to the preceding discussion of each of these items within this results of operations section and the individual segment explanations below 
ebitda is a supplemental financial measure not defined in generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we define ebitda as income attributable to foster wheeler ag before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because we believe it is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
certain covenants under our senior unsecured credit agreement use an adjusted form of ebitda such that in the covenant calculations the ebitda as presented herein is adjusted for certain unusual and infrequent items specifically excluded in the terms of our senior unsecured credit agreement 
we believe that the line item on the consolidated statement of operations entitled net income attributable to foster wheeler ag is the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net income attributable to foster wheeler ag as an indicator of operating performance or any other gaap financial measure 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information that is included in net income attributable to foster wheeler ag  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions that are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance some of our operations  interest is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations  it does not include taxes 
because the payment of taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes taxes has material limitations  and it does not include depreciation and amortization 
because we must utilize property  plant and equipment and intangible assets in order to generate revenues in our operations  depreciation and amortization are necessary and ongoing costs of our operations 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation and amortization has material limitations

overview of segment our global power group designs  manufactures and erects steam generators and auxiliary equipment for electric power generating stations  district heating and power plants and industrial facilities worldwide 
our competitive differentiation in serving these markets is the ability of our products to cleanly and efficiently burn a wide range of fuels  singularly or in combination 
in particular  our circulating fluidized bed  which we refer to as cfb  steam generators are able to burn coals of varying quality  as well as petroleum coke  lignite  municipal waste  waste wood  biomass  and numerous other materials 
among these fuel sources  coal is the most widely used  and thus the market drivers and constraints associated with coal strongly affect the steam generator market and our global power group s business 
additionally  our global power group owns and operates a waste to energy facility  holds a controlling interest and operates a combined cycle gas turbine facility  owns a noncontrolling interest in a petcoke fired cfb facility for refinery steam and power generation  and operates a university cogeneration power facility for steam electric generation 
our global power group offers a number of other products and services related to steam generators  including design  manufacture and installation of auxiliary and replacement equipment for utility power and industrial facilities  including surface condensers  feedwater heaters  coal pulverizers  steam generator coils and panels  biomass gasifiers  and replacement parts for steam generators 
design  supply and installation of nitrogen oxide  or nox  reduction systems and components for pulverized coal steam generators such as selective catalytic reduction systems  low nox combustion systems  low nox burners  primary combustion and overfire air systems and components  fuel and combustion air measuring and control systems and components 
design  supply and installation of flue gas desulfurization equipment for all types of steam generators and industrial equipment 
a broad range of site services including construction and erection services  maintenance engineering  steam generator upgrading and life extension  and plant repowering 
research and development in the areas of combustion  fluid and gas dynamics  heat transfer  materials and solid mechanics 
technology licenses to other steam generator suppliers in select countries 
our global power group has been impacted by unfavorable economic growth rates in most of its markets during as a result  the demand for the products and services of our global power group was negatively impacted by an increased level of timing delays related to project award dates 
however  we believe opportunities will continue in asia  the middle east and south america driven by growing electricity demand as a result of the economic growth rates in those regions 
a number of other constraining market factors continue to impact the markets that we serve 
political and environmental sensitivity regarding coal fired steam generators continues to cause prospective projects utilizing coal as their primary fuel to be postponed or cancelled as clients experience difficulty in obtaining the required environmental permits or decide to wait for additional clarity regarding governmental regulations 
the sensitivity has been especially pronounced in the us and western europe and with the concern that coal fired steam generators  relative to alternative fuel sources  contribute more toward global warming through the discharge of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere 
the outlook for continued lower natural gas pricing over the next three to five years  driven by increasing supply and new liquefied natural gas capacity  has increased the attractiveness of natural gas  in relation to coal  for the generation of electricity 
in addition  the constraints on the global credit market may continue to impact some of our clients 
table of contents investment plans as these clients are affected by the availability and cost of financing  as well as their own financial strategies  which could include cash conservation 
these factors could negatively impact investment in the power sector  which in turn could negatively impact our global power group s business 
there is potential downside risk to global economic growth driven primarily by continued sovereign debt and bank funding pressures in the eurozone  the speed at which governmental efforts directed at spending and debt reduction are being implemented and geopolitical oil supply risks  which could impact global economic growth through a significant rise in oil prices 
if these risks materialize  our global power group could be impacted 
longer term  we believe that global demand for electrical energy will continue to grow 
we believe that the majority of the growth will be driven by emerging economies and that solid fuel fired steam generators will continue to fill a significant portion of the incremental growth in new generating capacity in the emerging economies 
globally  we see a growing need to repower older coal plants with new  more efficient and cleaner burning plants  including both coal and other fuels  in order to meet environmental  financial and reliability goals set by policy makers in many countries 
the fuel flexibility of our cfb steam generators enables them to burn a wide variety of fuels other than coal and to produce carbon neutral electricity when fired by biomass 
in addition  our utility steam generators can be designed to incorporate supercritical steam technology  which we believe significantly improves power plant efficiency and reduces power plant emissions 
we are currently executing a project for four mwe supercritical cfb steam generators for a power project in south korea  which we believe is an indication of the successful scale up of our cfb technology and further advances our cfb supercritical technology with a vertical tube  once through design 
commercial operation of the units is scheduled for we completed an engineering and supply project for a pilot scale approximately megawatt thermal  equivalent to approximately megawatt electrical  or mwe cfb steam generator  which incorporates our carbon capturing flexi burn tm technology 
the pilot plant began successfully capturing co 

in september additionally  together with other parties through a grant agreement with the european commission  we are considering projects to further develop carbon capturing technology 
the grant agreement stipulates that the funding under the program will be used for carbon capture and storage technology development applicable to a mwe oxy fuel combustion power plant 
recently we were awarded a contract for heat recovery steam generators in ohio 
we also were awarded a contract for a design review with our licensee in india for a pc steam generator

progress towards completion on fixed price contracts is measured based on physical completion of individual tasks for all contracts with a value of  or greater 
for contracts with a value less than  progress toward completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs the cost to cost method 
progress towards completion on cost reimbursable contracts is measured based on the ratio of quantities expended to total forecasted quantities  typically man hours 
incentives are also recognized on a percentage of completion basis when the realization of an incentive is assessed as probable 
we include flow through costs consisting of materials  equipment or subcontractor services as both operating revenues and cost of operating revenues on cost reimbursable contracts when we have overall responsibility as the contractor for the engineering specifications and procurement or procurement services for such costs 
there is no contract profit impact of flow through costs as they are included in both operating revenues and cost of operating revenues 
contracts in process are stated at cost  increased for profits recorded on the completed effort or decreased for estimated losses  less billings to the customer and progress payments on uncompleted contracts 
a full provision for loss contracts is made at the time the loss becomes probable regardless of the stage of completion 
at any time  we have numerous contracts in progress  all of which are at various stages of completion 
accounting for revenues and profits on long term contracts requires estimates of total contract costs and estimates of progress toward completion to determine the extent of revenue and profit recognition 
we rely extensively on estimates to forecast quantities of labor man hours  materials and equipment  the costs for those quantities including exchange rates  and the schedule to execute the scope of work including allowances for weather  labor and civil unrest 
many of these estimates cannot be based on historical data  as most contracts are for unique  specifically designed facilities 
in determining the revenues  we must estimate the percentage of completion  the likelihood that the client will pay for the work performed  and the cash to be received net of any taxes ultimately due or withheld in the country where the work is performed 
projects are reviewed on an individual basis and the estimates used are tailored to the specific circumstances 
in establishing these estimates  we exercise significant judgment  and all possible risks cannot be specifically quantified 
the percentage of completion method requires that adjustments or re evaluations to estimated project revenues and costs  including estimated claim recoveries  be recognized on a project to date cumulative basis  as changes to the estimates are identified 
revisions to project estimates are made as additional information becomes available or as specific project circumstances change  including information that becomes available subsequent to the date of the consolidated financial statements up through the date such consolidated financial statements are filed with the sec 
if the final estimated profit to complete a long term contract indicates a loss  
table of contents provision is made immediately for the total loss anticipated 
profits are accrued throughout the life of the project based on the percentage of completion 
the project life cycle  including project specific warranty commitments  can be up to approximately six years in duration 
the actual project results can be significantly different from the estimated results 
when adjustments are identified near or at the end of a project  the full impact of the change in estimate is recognized as a change in the profit on the contract in that period 
this can result in a material impact on our results for a single reporting period 
we review all of our material contracts on a monthly basis and revise our estimates as appropriate for developments such as earning project incentive bonuses  incurring or expecting to incur contractual liquidated damages for performance or schedule issues  providing services and purchasing third party materials and equipment at costs differing from those previously estimated and testing completed facilities  which  in turn  eliminates or confirms completion and warranty related costs 
project incentives are recognized when it is probable they will be earned 
project incentives are frequently tied to cost  schedule and or safety targets and  therefore  tend to be earned late in a project s life cycle 
changes in estimated final contract revenues and costs can either increase or decrease the final estimated contract profit 
in the period in which a change in estimate is recognized  the cumulative impact of that change is recorded based on progress achieved through the period of change 
there were  and separate projects that experienced final estimated contract profit revisions with an impact on contract profit in excess of  in  and  respectively 
the changes in final estimated contract profit resulted in a net increase of   and  to reported contract profit for  and  respectively  relating to the revaluation of work performed on contracts in prior periods 
the changes in final estimated contract profit revisions during for our global power group were increased for a favorable settlement with a subcontractor of approximately  the changes in final estimated contract profit revisions during included the impact of two out of period corrections for reductions of final estimated profit totaling approximately  which included final estimated profit reductions in our global e c group and our global power group of approximately  and  respectively 
the corrections were recorded in as they were not material to previously issued financial statements  nor were they material to the financial statements 
the impact on contract profit is measured as of the beginning of each year and represents the incremental contract profit or loss that would have been recorded in prior periods had we been able to recognize in those periods the impact of the current period changes in final estimated profits 
asbestos some of our us and us subsidiaries are defendants in numerous asbestos related lawsuits and out of court informal claims pending in the united states and the united kingdom 
plaintiffs claim damages for personal injury alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with work allegedly performed by our subsidiaries during the s and earlier 
the calculation of asbestos related liabilities and assets involves the use of estimates as discussed below 
we believe the most critical assumptions within our asbestos liability estimate are the number of future mesothelioma claims to be filed against us  the number of mesothelioma claims that ultimately will require payment from us or our insurers  and the indemnity payments required to resolve those mesothelioma claims 
united states as of december   we had recorded total liabilities of  comprised of an estimated liability of  relating to open outstanding claims and an estimated liability of  relating to future unasserted claims through december  since  we have worked with analysis research planning corporation  or arpc  nationally recognized consultants in the united states with respect to projecting asbestos liabilities  to estimate the amount of asbestos related indemnity and defense costs at year end for the next years 
since that time  we have recorded our estimated asbestos liability at a level consistent with arpc s reasonable best estimate 

table of contents based on its review of the activity  arpc recommended that certain assumptions used to estimate our future asbestos liability be updated as of december  accordingly  we developed a revised estimate of our aggregate indemnity and defense costs through december  considering the advice of arpc 
in  we revalued our liability for asbestos indemnity and defense costs through december  to  which brought our liability to a level consistent with arpc s reasonable best estimate 
in connection with updating our estimated asbestos liability and related asset  we recorded a net charge of  in  which included a charge related to updating our assumptions for increased asbestos defense costs projected over our year estimate and  to a lesser extent  an adjustment for actual claim settlement experience during the year and an accrual of another year of estimated claims under our rolling year asbestos related liability estimate 
the total asbestos related liabilities are comprised of our estimates for our liability relating to open outstanding claims being valued and our liability for future unasserted claims through december  our liability estimate is based upon the following information and or assumptions number of open claims  forecasted number of future claims broken down by disease type mesothelioma  lung cancer  and non malignancies  and estimated average cost per claim by disease type mesothelioma  lung cancer and non malignancies  as well as other factors 
the total estimated liability  which has not been discounted for the time value of money  includes both the estimate of forecasted indemnity amounts and forecasted defense costs 
total defense costs and indemnity liability payments are estimated to be incurred through december   during which period the incidence of new claims is forecasted to decrease each year 
we believe that it is likely that there will be new claims filed after december   but in light of uncertainties inherent in long term forecasts  we do not believe that we can reasonably estimate the indemnity and defense costs that might be incurred after december  through december   total cumulative indemnity costs paid  prior to insurance recoveries  were approximately  and total cumulative defense costs paid were approximately  or approximately of total defense and indemnity costs 
as of december   we had recorded assets of  which represents our best estimate of settled and probable insurance recoveries relating to our liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims through december  asbestos related assets under executed settlement agreements with insurers due in the next months are recorded within accounts and notes receivable other and amounts due beyond months are recorded within asbestos related insurance recovery receivable 
our asbestos related insurance recovery receivable also includes our best estimate of settled and probable insurance recoveries relating to our liability for pending and estimated future asbestos claims through december  our asbestos related assets have not been discounted for the time value of money 
our insurance recoveries may be limited by future insolvencies among our insurers 
other than receivables related to bankruptcy court approved settlements during liquidation proceedings  we have not assumed recovery in the estimate of our asbestos related insurance asset from any of our currently insolvent insurers 
we have considered the financial viability and legal obligations of our subsidiaries insurance carriers and believe that the insurers or their guarantors will continue to reimburse a significant portion of claims and defense costs relating to asbestos litigation 
as of december  and  we have not recorded an allowance for uncollectible balances against our asbestos related insurance assets 
we write off receivables from insurers that have become insolvent  there have been no such write offs during  or during  we reached an agreement with an insurer that was under bankruptcy liquidation and for which we had written off our receivable prior to the asset awarded under the bankruptcy liquidation for this insurer was  and was included in our asbestos related assets as of december  this receivable was subsequently collected during other insurers may become insolvent in the future and our insurers may fail to reimburse amounts owed to us on a timely basis 
if we fail to realize the expected insurance recoveries  or experience delays in receiving material amounts from our insurers  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we plan to update our forecasts periodically to take into consideration our experience and to update our estimate of future costs and expected insurance recoveries 
the estimate of the liabilities and assets related to asbestos claims and recoveries is subject to a number of uncertainties that may result in significant changes in the current estimates 
among these are uncertainties as to the ultimate number and type of claims filed  the amount 
table of contents of claim costs  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies with asbestos claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  as well as potential legislative changes 
increases in the number of claims filed or costs to resolve those claims could cause us to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities in the december  consolidated financial statements associated with a change in certain estimates used in relation to the us asbestos related liabilities 
changes increase or decrease in assumption approximate change in liability one percentage point change in the inflation rate related to the indemnity and defense costs twenty five percent change in average indemnity settlement amount twenty five percent change in forecasted number of new claims based on the december  liability estimate  an increase of in the average per claim indemnity settlement amount would increase the liability by  as described above and the impact on expense would be dependent upon available additional insurance recoveries 
assuming no change to the assumptions currently used to estimate our insurance asset  this increase would result in a charge in the statement of operations of approximately of the increase in the liability 
long term cash flows would ultimately change by the same amount 
should there be an increase in the estimated liability in excess of  the percentage of that increase that would be expected to be funded by additional insurance recoveries would decline 
our subsidiaries have been effective in managing the asbestos litigation  in part  because our subsidiaries have access to historical project documents and other business records going back more than years  allowing them to defend themselves by determining if the claimants were present at the location of the alleged asbestos exposure and  if so  the timing and extent of their presence  maintain good records on insurance policies and have identified and validated policies issued since  and have consistently and vigorously defended these claims which has resulted in dismissal of claims that are without merit or settlement of meritorious claims at amounts that are considered reasonable 
united kingdom as of december   we had recorded total liabilities of  comprised of an estimated liability relating to open outstanding claims of  and an estimated liability relating to future unasserted claims through december  of  an asset in substantially an equal amount was recorded for the expected uk asbestos related insurance recoveries 
the liability estimates are based on a uk house of lords judgment that pleural plaque claims do not amount to a compensable injury and accordingly  we have reduced our liability assessment 
if this ruling is reversed by legislation  the total asbestos liability recorded in the uk would increase to approximately  with a corresponding increase in the asbestos related asset 
defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans in the us  the us  canada  finland  france  india and south africa and we have other postretirement benefit plans  or opeb plans  for health care and life insurance benefits in the us and canada 
our defined benefit pension plans  or pension plans  cover certain full time employees 
under the pension plans  retirement benefits are primarily a function of both years of service and level of compensation 
the us pension plans  which are closed to new entrants and additional benefit accruals  and the canada  finland  france and india pension plans are non contributory 
the uk pension plan  which is closed to new entrants and additional benefit accruals  and the south africa pension plan are both contributory plans 
certain employees in the us and canada may become eligible for health care and life insurance benefits  or other postretirement benefits  if they qualify for and commence receipt of normal or early retirement pension 
table of contents benefits as defined in the us and canada pension plans while working for us 
additionally  one of our subsidiaries in the us also has a benefit plan which provides coverage for an employee s beneficiary upon the death of the employee 
this plan has been closed to new entrants since our defined benefit pension and opeb plans are accounted for in accordance with current accounting guidance  which requires us to recognize the funded status of each of our defined benefit pension and opeb plans on the consolidated balance sheet 
the guidance also requires us to recognize any gains or losses  which are not recognized as a component of annual service cost  as a component of comprehensive income  net of tax 
please refer to note of the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for more information 
the calculations of defined benefit pension and opeb plan liabilities  annual service cost and cash contributions required rely heavily on estimates about future events often extending decades into the future 
we are responsible for establishing the assumptions used for the estimates  which include the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future obligations  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected rate of annual salary increases  the selection of the actuarial mortality tables  the annual healthcare cost trend rate only for the opeb plans  and the annual inflation rate 
we utilize our business judgment in establishing the estimates used in the calculations of our pension and opeb plan liabilities  annual service cost and cash contributions 
these estimates are updated on an annual basis or more frequently upon the occurrence of significant events 
the estimates can vary significantly from the actual results and we cannot provide any assurance that the estimates used to calculate the pension and or opeb plan liabilities included herein will approximate actual results 
the volatility between the assumptions and actual results can be significant

table of contents the discount rate is developed using a market based approach that matches our projected benefit payments to a spot yield curve of high quality corporate bonds 
changes in the discount rate from period to period were generally due to changes in long term interest rates 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is developed using a weighted average methodology  blending the expected returns on each class of investment in the plans portfolio 
the expected returns by asset class are developed considering both past performance and future considerations 
we annually review and adjust  as required  the long term rate of return for our pension plans 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets has ranged from to over the past three years 
the following tables reflect the sensitivities in the consolidated financial statements associated with a change in certain estimates used in relation to the us and the us defined benefit pension plans 
each of the sensitivities below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that particular estimate 
approximate increase decrease impact on us pension plan pension liability benefit cost one tenth of a percentage point increase in the discount rate one tenth of a percentage point decrease in the discount rate one tenth of a percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets one tenth of a percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets approximate increase decrease impact on uk pension plan pension asset benefit cost one tenth of a percentage point increase in the discount rate one tenth of a percentage point decrease in the discount rate one tenth of a percentage point increase in the expected return on plan assets one tenth of a percentage point decrease in the expected return on plan assets accumulated net actuarial losses and prior service credits from our pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic benefit cost over the next year are  and  respectively 
estimated amortization of net transition obligation over the next year is inconsequential 
net actuarial losses reflect differences between expected and actual plan experience  including returns on plan assets  and changes in actuarial assumptions  all of which occurred over time 
these net actuarial losses  to the extent not offset by future actuarial gains  will result in increases in our future pension costs depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in which losses are not amortized 
the net actuarial losses outside the corridor are amortized over the expected remaining service periods of active participants approximately  and years for the canadian  south african and finnish plans  respectively and average remaining life expectancy of participants for our closed plans approximately and years for the us and us plans  respectively since benefits are closed 
a one tenth of a percentage point decrease or increase in the funding rates  used for calculating future funding requirements to the us plan through  would not have an impact on aggregate contributions over the next five years 
a one tenth of a percentage point decrease in the funding rates  used for calculating future funding requirements to the uk plan through  would increase aggregate contributions over the next five years by approximately  while an increase by one tenth of a percentage point would decrease aggregate contributions by approximately  accumulated net actuarial losses and prior service credits that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net periodic postretirement benefit cost in connection with our opeb plans over the next

share based compensation plans our share based compensation plans include awards for stock options and restricted stock units and performance based restricted stock units collectively  restricted awards 
we measure these awards at fair value on their grant date and recognize compensation cost in the consolidated statements of operations over their vesting period 
the following table summarizes our share based compensation expense and related income tax benefit share based compensation related income tax benefit as of december   the breakdown of our unrecognized compensation cost and related weighted average period for the cost to be recognized were as follows december  weighted average period for cost to be recognized unrecognized compensation cost stock options  years restricted awards  years total unrecognized compensation cost  years we estimate the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we then recognize the grant date fair value of each option as compensation expense ratably using the straight line attribution method over the service period generally the vesting period 
the black scholes model incorporates the following assumptions expected volatility we estimate the volatility of our share price at the grant date using a look back period which coincides with the expected term  defined below 
we believe using a look back period which coincides with the expected term is the most appropriate measure for determining expected volatility 
expected term we estimate the expected term using the simplified method  as outlined in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
risk free interest rate we estimate the risk free interest rate using the us treasury yield curve for periods equal to the expected term of the options in effect at the time of grant 
dividends we use an expected dividend yield of zero because we have not declared or paid a cash dividend since july and we do not have any plans to declare or pay any cash dividends 
we estimate the fair value of restricted share unit awards using the market price of our shares on the date of grant 
we then recognize the fair value of each restricted share unit award as compensation expense ratably using the straight line attribution method over the service period generally the vesting period 

table of contents certain of our executives have been awarded performance based restricted share units or performance rsus 
under these awards  the number of restricted share units that ultimately vest depend on our share price performance against specified performance goals  which are defined in our performance based award agreements 
we estimate the grant date fair value of each performance rsu award using a monte carlo valuation model 
we then recognize the fair value of each performance rsu award as compensation expense ratably using the straight line attribution method over the service period generally the vesting period 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant using a combination of historical data and demographic characteristics  and we revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of current accounting guidance  the compensation expense that we record for awards in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved in selecting the option pricing model assumptions used to estimate share based compensation expense 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair value of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual value realized upon the exercise vesting  expiration or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
stock options and performance rsus may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value compared to the fair value originally estimated on the grant date and the expense reported in the consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair value originally estimated on the grant date and the expense reported in the consolidated financial statements 
there are significant differences among valuation models 
this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
there is also a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and may materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our share based compensation plans 
goodwill and intangible assets at least annually  we evaluate goodwill for potential impairment 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be the components one level below our operating segments  as these components constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
presently  goodwill exists in four of our reporting units one within our global power group business segment and three within our global e c group business segment 
we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  if so  no further assessments are performed 
for reporting units where that is not the case  we perform a goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation  with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of each year  we evaluate goodwill at each reporting unit based on assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our reporting units and assess recoverability  and impairments  if any  which are recognized in earnings 
an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment together with other tangible long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 

table of contents we determined that both the income and market valuation approaches would be considered by market participants 
under the income valuation approach  we employ a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit 
this model requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions regarding future revenues  costs  margins  capital expenditures  changes in working capital  terminal year growth rate and cost of capital 
our cash flow models are based on our forecasted results for the applicable reporting units 
the models also assume a growth rate in the terminal year 
actual results could differ from our projections 
under the market valuation approach  we employ the guideline publicly traded company method  which indicates the fair value of the equity of each reporting unit by comparing it to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
after identifying and selecting guideline companies  we analyze their business and financial profiles for relative similarity 
factors such as size  growth  risk and profitability are analyzed and compared to each of our reporting units 
during our annual evaluation  we noted that the indicated fair value was above the carrying value for each of our reporting units 
goodwill of  related to one of our global e c group s reporting units 
our estimate of the fair value of this reporting unit during our impairment test was sufficiently in excess of its carrying value even after conducting various sensitivity analyses on key assumptions  such that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required 
however  should the performance of this unit deteriorate in the future  which could result in a decline in its estimated fair value  its carrying value could exceed its fair value in future periods  which could lead to an impairment of goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for tax attributes credits or loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates based on the date of enactment 
within each jurisdiction and taxpaying component  current deferred tax assets and liabilities and noncurrent deferred tax assets and liabilities are combined and presented as a net amount 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based upon available evidence  it is more likely than not that the tax benefit of loss carryforwards or other deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
in evaluating our ability to realize our deferred tax assets within the various tax jurisdictions in which they arise  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of taxable temporary differences  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial performance 
projecting future taxable income requires significant assumptions about future operating results  as well as the timing and character of taxable income in numerous jurisdictions 
we have a valuation allowance of  recorded as of december  primarily in the us the majority of the us federal tax benefits  against which valuation allowances have been established  do not expire until and beyond  based on current tax laws 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our subsidiaries file income tax returns in many tax jurisdictions  including the united states  several us states and numerous us jurisdictions around the world 
tax returns are also filed in jurisdictions where our subsidiaries execute project related work 
the statute of limitations varies by jurisdiction 
because of the number of jurisdictions in which we file tax returns  in any given year the statute of limitations in a number of jurisdictions may expire within months from the balance sheet date 
as a result  we expect recurring changes in unrecognized tax benefits due to the expiration of the statute of limitations  none of which are expected to be individually significant 
with few exceptions  we are no longer subject to us including federal  state and local or non us income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 
table of contents a number of tax years are under audit by the relevant tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the us and several states within the us we anticipate that several of these audits may be concluded in the foreseeable future  including in based on the status of these audits  it is reasonably possible that the conclusion of the audits may result in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits 
however  it is not possible to estimate the magnitude of any such reduction at this time 
as of december   we had  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would  if recognized  affect our effective tax rate before existing valuation allowance considerations 
we recognize interest accrued on the unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties on the unrecognized tax benefits in other deductions  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
previously accrued interest and or penalties that are ultimately not assessed reduce current year expense 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of our income taxes 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk amounts in thousands of dollars interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates should we need to borrow under our senior unsecured credit agreement there were no such borrowings as of december  and  based on our current operating plans and cash flow forecasts  none are expected in and  to a limited extent  under our variable rate special purpose limited recourse project debt for any portion of the debt for which we have not entered into a fixed rate swap agreement 
if average market rates are basis points higher in the next months  our interest expense for such period of time would increase  and our income before income taxes would decrease  by approximately this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our variable rate borrowings as of december  and does not reflect the impact of interest rate changes on outstanding debt held by certain of our equity interests since such debt is not consolidated on our balance sheet 
foreign currency risk we operate on a worldwide basis with substantial operations in europe that subject us to foreign currency exchange rate risk mainly relative to the british pound  euro and polish zloty 
under our risk management policies  we do not hedge translation risk exposure 
all activities of our affiliates are recorded in their functional currency  which is typically the local currency in the country of domicile of the affiliate 
in the ordinary course of business  our affiliates enter into transactions in currencies other than their respective functional currencies 
we seek to minimize the resulting foreign currency transaction risk by contracting for the procurement of goods and services in the same currency as the sales value of the related long term contract 
we further mitigate the risk through the use of foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure  such as anticipated foreign currency purchases or revenues  back to their functional currency 
we utilize all such financial instruments solely for hedging  and our company policy prohibits the speculative use of such instruments 
however  for financial reporting purposes  these contracts are generally not accounted for as hedges 
the notional amount of our foreign currency forward contracts provides one measure of our transaction volume outstanding as of the balance sheet date 
as of december   we had a total gross notional amount  measured in us dollar equivalent  of approximately  related to foreign currency forward contracts and the primary currencies hedged were the british pound  chinese yuan  euro and us dollar 
amounts ultimately realized upon final settlement of these financial instruments  along with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures within our long term contracts  will depend on actual market exchange rates during the remaining life of the instruments 
the contract maturity dates range from through we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties 
these counterparties are commercial banks that are primarily rated bbb or better by s p or the equivalent by other recognized credit rating agencies 
further significant deterioration of the current global economic and credit market environment  particularly in the eurozone countries  could challenge our efforts to maintain our well diversified asset allocation with creditworthy financial institutions 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further information on our primary foreign currency forward exchange contracts
