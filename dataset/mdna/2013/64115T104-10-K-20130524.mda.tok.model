overview netscout was founded in and is headquartered in westford  massachusetts 
we design  develop  manufacture  market  sell and support market leading unified service delivery management  service assurance and application performance management solutions focused on assuring service delivery for the world s largest  most demanding and complex ip based service delivery environments 
we manufacture and market these products in integrated hardware and software solutions that are used by commercial enterprises  large governmental agencies and telecommunication service providers worldwide 
we have a single operating segment and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the united states 
our operating results are influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the mix and quantity of products and services sold  pricing  costs of materials used in our products  growth in employee related costs  including commissions  and the expansion of our operations 
factors that affect our ability to maximize our operating results include  but are not limited to  our ability to introduce and enhance existing products  the marketplace acceptance of those new or enhanced products  continued expansion into international markets  development of strategic partnerships  competition  successful acquisition integration efforts  our ability to achieve expense reductions and make structural improvements and current economic conditions 
our key objectives have been to continue to gain market share in the wireless service provider market and to accelerate our enterprise growth by extending into the application performance management segment 
a key common component of both initiatives has been our aggressive acquisition of the strongly complementary packet flow or monitoring switch technology 
on october   we completed the acquisition of onpath technologies  inc onpath  an established provider of scalable packet flow switching technology for high performance networks for the aggregation and distribution of network traffic for data  voice  video testing  monitoring  performance 
table of contents management and cybersecurity deployments 
onpath s packet flow switch technology is synergistic with our network monitoring switch strategy 
the acquisition of the packet flow switch technology further strengthens our unified service delivery management strategy by enabling scalable access to all relevant network traffic across highly distributed network environments for use by any network monitoring  performance management and security system 
onpath s test automation technology is used to monitor networks in test environments which simulate existing and planned network environments 
we paid million in cash for the acquisition of onpath and million of additional compensation consideration which could be paid out in the future 
on july   we completed the acquisition of certain assets  technology and employees from accanto systems  srl accanto 
accanto provides service assurance for telecommunication service providers enabling carriers to monitor and manage the delivery of voice services over converged  next generation network architectures 
this technology is synergistic with our packet flow strategy and brings voice service monitoring capabilities for legacy voice environments and for next generation network voice services  including voice over ip voip and voice over long term evolution volte for g wireless networks 
we paid million for the acquisition of accanto 
at the end of our fiscal year ended march   we entered the market with the packet aggregation switch we acquired from simena 
during the second half of our fiscal year ended march   we added a high capacity  chassis based packet flow switch line that we acquired from onpath in october the combination of these two products has provided us with a wide range of price performance and scale  well suited for both large enterprise and service provider applications 
in the wireless service provider sector we continued to gain market share primarily driven by our leading g and lte data service assurance solutions globally 
our strategy here has been to complement our solution portfolio with an integrated legacy and g g voice service assurance capability 
a component of this strategy was the acquisition of accanto earlier in the fiscal year ended march   providing us important voice service monitoring for legacy voice environments and next generation network voice services 
overall  in the service provider market we continue to capitalize on major growth drivers 
we have gained market share in the tier mobile packet switched core where we are servicing g g and now g infrastructures that are being driven further with capacity upgrades from existing customers 
we have also been gaining new tier customers as we expand our presence both in the us and around the world 
we have been building our product to capture the carriers rapid expansion of ip services where we have become a leader 
a large business opportunity for us is the servicing of diameter routing agents that is used in all ip networks such as long term evolution lte technologies and ip multimedia subsystem ims 
we are playing a central role in managing the complexity of the surge of different devices from handhelds to tablets  and how those users attach to the network  in areas such as authentication  authorization  policy and charging 
another area of growth is ran aggregation  where there is a major transformation of the access and backhaul areas of the network 
carriers are consolidating g  g  and g into one box  combined with new lte rollouts 
we are helping to manage the handset and cell tower issues 
during our fiscal year ended march   we intend to work to expand our capabilities to provide end to end monitoring by adding significant enhancements and features to our product set 
results overview we saw continued growth during the fiscal year ended march   with product revenue growth of and overall revenue growth of compared to the prior fiscal year 
our earnings per share for the fiscal year ended march  were per share  representing a  or  increase over the same period in the prior year 
our business maintained strong gross profit margins 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended march  remained flat at compared to the same period in the prior year 
we ended fiscal year with an immaterial amount of product backlog  compared to million as of the end of fiscal year 
table of contents at march   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
this represents a decrease of million over the previous fiscal year ended march  during the fiscal year ended march   we maintained our liquidity despite acquisitions of product technology as well as cash outflows as a result of our share repurchase program and the repayment of million of long term debt 
use of non gaap financial measures we supplement the generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measures we report in quarterly earnings announcements  investor presentations and other investor communications by reporting the following non gaap measures non gaap revenue  non gaap net income and non gaap net income per diluted share 
non gaap revenue eliminates the gaap effects of acquisitions by adding back revenue related to deferred revenue revaluation 
non gaap net income includes the foregoing adjustment and also removes inventory fair value adjustments  expenses related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation  restructuring  certain expenses relating to acquisitions including compensation for post combination services and business development charges  as well as early extinguishment of debt  net of related income tax effects 
non gaap diluted net income per share also excludes these expenses as well as the related impact of all these adjustments on the provision for income taxes 
these non gaap measures are not in accordance with gaap  should not be considered an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with gaap revenue  net income and diluted net income per share  and may have limitations in that they do not reflect all our results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should only be used to evaluate our results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures 
the presentation of non gaap information is not meant to be considered superior to  in isolation from or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with gaap 
management believes these non gaap financial measures enhance the reader s overall understanding of our current financial performance and its prospects for the future by providing a higher degree of transparency for certain financial measures and providing a level of disclosure that helps investors understand how we plan and measure our business 
we believe that providing these non gaap measures affords investors a view of our operating results that may be more easily compared to our peer companies and also enables investors to consider our operating results on both a gaap and non gaap basis during and following the integration period of our acquisitions 
presenting the gaap measures on their own may not be indicative of our core operating results 
furthermore  management believes that the presentation of non gaap measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures provide useful information to management and investors regarding present and future business trends relating to our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the following table reconciles revenue  net income and net income per share on a gaap and non gaap basis for the years ended march   and in thousands year ended march  gaap revenue revenue impact of accounting change deferred revenue fair value adjustment non gaap revenue gaap net income revenue adjustments inventory fair value adjustment share based compensation expense amortization of acquired intangible assets business development and integration expense compensation for post combination services restructuring charges loss on extinguishment of debt income tax adjustments non gaap net income gaap diluted net income per share share impact of non gaap adjustments identified above non gaap diluted net income per share critical accounting policies we consider accounting policies related to marketable securities  revenue recognition  valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other acquisition accounting items  and share based compensation to be critical in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results 
the application of these policies involves significant judgments and estimates by us 
marketable securities we measure the fair value of our marketable securities at the end of each reporting period 
fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
marketable securities are recorded at fair value and have been classified as level or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in accessible active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves 
investments and marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
we periodically evaluate whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary by considering available evidence regarding these investments including  among other factors  the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends and our intent and ability to retain our investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in market value 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost 
table of contents basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and marketable securities in our portfolio if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
revenue recognition product revenue consists of sales of our hardware products which include required embedded software that works together with the hardware to deliver the hardware s essential functionality  licensing of our software products  and sale of hardware bundled with a software license 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
because many of our solutions are comprised of both hardware and more than incidental software components  we recognize revenue in accordance with authoritative guidance on both hardware and software revenue recognition 
service revenue consists primarily of fees from customer support agreements  consulting and training 
we generally provide software and hardware support as part of product sales 
revenue related to the initial bundled software and hardware support is recognized ratably over the support period 
in addition  customers can elect to purchase extended support agreements for periods after the initial software warranty expiration 
support services generally include rights to unspecified upgrades when and if available  telephone and internet based support  updates and bug fixes 
revenue from customer support agreements is recognized ratably over the support period 
reimbursements of out of pocket expenditures incurred in connection with providing consulting services are included in services revenue  with the offsetting expense recorded in cost of service revenue 
training services include on site and classroom training 
training revenues are recognized as the related training services are provided 
generally  our contracts are accounted for individually 
however  when contracts are closely interrelated and dependent on each other  it may be necessary to account for two or more contracts as one to reflect the substance of the group of contracts 
multi element arrangements are concurrent customer purchases of a combination of our product and service offerings that may be delivered at various points in time 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of hardware products and related services  we allocate the total arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on each element s selling price compared to the total relative selling price of all the elements 
each element s selling price is based on management s best estimate of selling price besp paid by customers based on the element s historical pricing when vsoe or tpe does not exist 
we have established besp for product elements as the average selling price the element was sold for over the past six quarters  whether sold alone or sold as part of a multiple element transaction 
our internal list price for products  reviewed quarterly by senior management  with consideration in regards to changing factors in our technology and in the marketplace  is generated to target the desired gross margin from sales of product after analyzing historical discounting trends 
we review sales of the product elements on a quarterly basis and update  when appropriate  besp for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
we have established vsoe for services related undelivered elements 
for multi element arrangements comprised only of software products and related services  we allocate a portion of the total arrangement consideration to the undelivered elements  primarily support agreements and training  using vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements 
the remaining portion of the total arrangement consideration is allocated to the delivered software  referred to as the residual method 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price customers pay when the element is sold separately 
we review the separate sales of the undelivered elements on a quarterly basis and update  when appropriate  its vsoe of fair value for such elements to ensure that it reflects recent pricing experience 
if we cannot objectively determine the 
table of contents vsoe of the fair value of any undelivered software element  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
for multi element arrangements comprised of a combination of hardware and software elements  the total arrangement consideration is bifurcated between the hardware and hardware related deliverables and the software and software related deliverables based on the relative selling prices of all deliverables as a group 
then  arrangement consideration for the hardware and hardware related services is recognized upon delivery or as the related services are provided outlined above and revenue for the software and software related services is allocated following the residual method and recognized based upon delivery or as the related services are provided 
our product is distributed through our direct sales force and indirect distribution channels through alliances with resellers 
revenue arrangements with resellers are recognized on a sell in basis  that is  when we deliver the product to the reseller 
we record consideration given to a reseller as a reduction of revenue to the extent we have recorded revenue from the reseller 
we do not offer contractual rights of return  stock balancing  or price protection to our resellers  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
in addition  we have history of successfully collecting receivables from the resellers 
as a result  we do not maintain reserves for reseller product returns 
valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other acquisition accounting items the carrying value of goodwill was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
we have two reporting units unified service delivery and test automation 
goodwill is tested for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting segment below its carrying value 
because netscout  and our two reporting units  did not experience any significant adverse changes in our business or reporting structures  we performed the qualitative step assessment 
in performing the qualitative step assessment  we considered certain events and circumstances specific to the entity at the reporting unit level  such as macroeconomic conditions  industry and market considerations  overall financial performance and cost factors when evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
no indicators of impairment were noted as of january  additionally  the market capitalization of netscout as a whole significantly exceeded its carrying value 
the carrying value of intangible assets was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives  except for the acquired tradename which resulted from the network general acquisition  which has an indefinite life and thus  is not amortized 
the carrying value of the indefinite lived tradename is evaluated annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
during the fiscal year ended march   we early adopted authoritative guidance that gives entities an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired 
if based on its qualitative assessment an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  quantitative impairment testing is required 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  quantitative impairment testing is not required 
we completed our annual impairment test of the indefinite lived intangible as of january  using the qualitative step assessment described above  which largely mirrors the unified service delivery analysis  as the tradenames apply to a majority of the products and branding within that reporting unit 
no impairment indicators were observed as of january  
table of contents we have acquired five companies during the three year period ended march  the acquisition method of accounting requires that we estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired as part of these transactions 
in order to estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles we use a relief from royalty model which requires management to estimate future revenues expected to be generated by the acquired intangibles  a royalty rate which a market participant would pay related to the projected revenue stream  a present value factor which approximates a risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing the assets  and a technology migration curve representing a period of time over which the technology assets or some portion thereof are still being used 
we are also required to develop the fair value for customer relationships acquired as part of these transactions which requires that we create estimates for the following items a projection of future revenues associated with the acquired company s existing customers  a turnover rate for those customers  a margin related to those sales  and risk adjusted rate of return for a market participant purchasing those relationships 
the acquisition of simena llc also contained contingent features based on the ultimate settlement of assets and liabilities acquired as part of transaction  and the former owners future period of employment with the company 
contingent consideration accounting requires the company to estimate the probability of various settlement scenarios  the former owners expected period of employment with netscout  and a risk adjusted interest rate to present value to the payment streams 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments 
under the fair value recognition provisions  we recognize share based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
based on historical experience  we assumed an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our directors  and an annualized forfeiture rate of for awards granted to our senior executives and remaining employees 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated

our reported international revenue does not include any revenue from sales to customers outside the united states that are shipped to our united states based indirect channel partners 
these domestic resellers fulfill customer orders based upon joint selling efforts in conjunction with our direct sales force and may subsequently ship our products to international locations  however  we report these shipments as united states revenue since we ship the products to a domestic location
