table of contents 
index to financial statements item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s overview we provide a wide range of well site services to oil and natural gas drilling and producing companies  including completion and remedial services  fluid services  well servicing and contract drilling services 
our results of operations reflect the impact of our acquisition strategy as a leading consolidator in the domestic land based well services industry 
our acquisitions have increased our breadth of service offerings at the well site and expanded our market presence 
in implementing this strategy  we have purchased businesses and assets in separate acquisitions from january  to december  for total consideration of million 
our hydraulic horsepower capacity for pumping services increased from  at december  to  at december  our weighted average number of fluid service trucks increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of our weighted average number of well servicing rigs increased from in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of our weighted average number of drilling rigs increased from nine in the first quarter of to in the fourth quarter of these acquisitions make changes in revenues  expenses and income not directly comparable between periods 
our operating revenues from each of our segments  and their relative percentages of our total revenues  consisted of the following dollars in millions year ended december  revenues completion and remedial services fluid services well servicing contract drilling total revenues our core businesses depend on our customers willingness to make expenditures to produce  develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the united states 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors  such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers 
the volatility of the oil and natural gas industry  and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity  could adversely impact the level of drilling and workover activity by some of our customers 
this volatility also affects the demand for our services and the price of our services 
in addition  the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices 
for a more comprehensive discussion of our industry trends  see general industry overview included in items and  business and properties  of this annual report on form k 
we derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations 
demand for these production related services  including well servicing and fluid services  tends to remain relatively stable  even in moderate oil and natural gas price environments  as ongoing maintenance spending is required to sustain production 
as oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels  demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells 
because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities  our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease 
during  oil prices remained relatively stable following the increase experienced in the second half of while natural gas prices remained depressed 
oil prices increased during the first half of primarily due to political and economic instability in several oil producing countries and remained stable through the first half 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of oil prices became volatile in the second half of and many of our customers did not outspend their approved budgets causing activity levels to decline and lower prices for our services 
natural gas prices since have continued to be low resulting in excess equipment being relocated from gas based operating areas to the busier oil based operating  areas increasing competition and reducing pricing for our services 
we expect our customers to gradually increase their spending with the us land drilling rig count building throughout the year  increasing the demand for our completion services in the oil based operating areas 
we believe that natural gas fundamentals remain weak and not supporting significant natural gas drilling in we will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our business through selective acquisitions and internal growth initiatives 
our capital investment decisions are determined by an analysis of the projected return on capital employed of each of those alternatives  which is substantially driven by the cost to acquire existing assets from a third party  the capital required to build new equipment and the point in the oil and natural gas commodity price cycle 
based on these factors  we make capital investment decisions that we believe will support our long term growth strategy 
while we believe our costs of integration for prior acquisitions have been reflected in our historical results of operations  integration of acquisitions may result in unforeseen operational difficulties or require a disproportionate amount of our management s attention 
we believe that the most important performance measures for our business segments are as follows completion and remedial services segment profits as a percent of revenues  fluid services trucking hours  revenue per truck  segment profits per truck and segment profits as a percent of revenues  well servicing rig hours  rig utilization rate  revenue per rig hour  profits per rig hour and segment profits as a percent of revenues  and contract drilling rig operating days  revenue per drilling day  profits per drilling day and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
segment profits are computed as segment operating revenues less direct operating costs 
these measurements provide important information to us about the activity and profitability of our lines of business

segment overview completion and remedial services in  our completion and remedial services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our completion and remedial services segment are generally derived from a variety of services designed to stimulate oil and natural gas production or place cement slurry within the wellbores 
our completion and remedial services segment includes pumping services  rental and fishing tool operations  coiled tubing services  nitrogen services  cased hole wireline services  snubbing and underbalanced drilling 
our pumping services concentrate on providing single truck  lower horsepower cementing  acidizing and fracturing services in selected markets 
our total hydraulic horsepower capacity for our pumping services was approximately  horsepower at december  compared to  horsepower and  horsepower at december  and december   respectively 
our rental and fishing tool business operates rental and fishing tool stores in selected markets as of december  our snubbing services operate units throughout our geographic footprint as of december  we entered the snubbing business in with the acquisition of team snubbing services  which operated in arkansas 
we further expanded our snubbing business in through the acquisition of platinum pressure services  inc  which operated in texas  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana and pennsylvania

in this segment  we generally derive our revenues on a project by project basis in a competitive bidding process 
our bids are generally based on the amount and type of equipment and personnel required  with the materials consumed billed separately 
during periods of decreased spending by oil and gas companies  we may be required to discount our rates to remain competitive  which would cause lower segment profits 
the following is an analysis of our completion and remedial services segment for each of the quarters and years in the years ended december   and dollars in thousands revenues segment profits first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter full year we gauge the performance of our completion and remedial services segment based on the segment s operating revenues and segment profits as a percent of revenues 
fluid services in  our fluid services segment represented of our revenues 
revenues in our fluid services segment are earned from the sale  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids used in the drilling  production and maintenance of oil and natural gas wells 
revenues also include water treatment  well site construction and maintenance services 
the fluid services segment has a base level of business consisting of transporting and disposing of salt water produced as a by product of the production of oil and natural gas 
these services are necessary for our customers and generally have a stable demand but typically produce lower relative segment profits than other parts of our fluid services segment 
fluid services for completion and workover projects typically require fresh or brine water for making drilling mud  circulating fluids or frac fluids used during a job  and all of these fluids require storage tanks and hauling and disposal 
because we can provide a full complement of fluid sales  trucking  storage and disposal required on most drilling and workover projects  the add on services associated with drilling and workover activity enable us to generate higher segment profits 
the higher segment profits are due to the relatively small incremental labor costs associated with providing these services in addition to our base fluid services operations 
revenues from our well site construction services are derived primarily from preparing 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and maintaining access roads and well locations  installing small diameter gathering lines and pipelines  constructing foundations to support drilling rigs and providing maintenance services for oil and natural gas facilities 
we typically price fluid services by the job  by the hour or by the quantities sold  disposed of or hauled

well servicing in  our well servicing segment represented of our revenues 
revenue in our well servicing segment is derived from maintenance  workover  completion and plugging and abandonment services  as well as rig manufacturing operations 
we provide maintenance related services as part of the normal  periodic upkeep of producing oil and natural gas wells 
maintenance related services represent a relatively consistent component of our business 
workover and completion services generate more revenue per hour than maintenance work due to the use of auxiliary equipment  but demand for workover and completion services fluctuates more with the overall activity level in the industry 
we typically charge our well servicing rig customers for services on an hourly basis at rates that are determined by the type of service and equipment required  market conditions in the region in which the rig operates  the ancillary equipment provided on the rig and the necessary personnel 
we measure the activity level of our well servicing rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a hour work week per rig 
we acquired our rig manufacturing business in may we manufacture workover rigs for internal purposes as well as to sell to outside companies 
our rig manufacturing operation also performs large scale refurbishments and maintenance services to used workover rigs

contract drilling in  our contract drilling segment represented of our revenues 
revenues from our contract drilling segment are derived primarily from the drilling of new wells 
within this segment  we typically charge our drilling rig customers at a daywork daily rate  or footage at an established rate per number of feet drilled 
depending on the type of job  we may also charge by the project 
we measure the activity level of our drilling rigs on a weekly basis by calculating a rig utilization rate based on a seven day work week per rig 
in the fourth quarter of  we converted three of our drilling rigs to well service rigs 
we acquired six used drilling rigs during from several different companies 
we acquired two drilling rigs during the first quarter of  which increased our total number of drilling rigs to

operating cost overview our operating costs are comprised primarily of labor costs  including workers compensation and health insurance  repair and maintenance  fuel and insurance 
a majority of our employees are paid on an hourly basis 
we also incur costs to employ personnel to sell and supervise our services and perform maintenance on our fleet 
these costs are not directly tied to our level of business activity 
compensation for our administrative personnel in local operating yards and in our corporate office is accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
repair and maintenance is performed by our crews  company maintenance personnel and outside service providers 
insurance is generally a fixed cost regardless of utilization and relates to the number of rigs  trucks and other equipment in our fleet  employee payroll and our safety record 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are impacted by the accounting policies used and the estimates and assumptions made by management during their preparation 
a complete summary of these policies is included in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies we have identified below accounting policies that are of particular importance in the presentation of our financial position  results of operations and cash flows and which require the application of significant judgment by management 

table of contents 
index to financial statements property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  or at estimated fair value at acquisition date if acquired in a business combination 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
we also review the capitalization of refurbishment of workover rigs as described in note of the notes to our historical consolidated financial statements 
impairments 
we review our assets for impairment at a minimum annually  or whenever  in management s judgment  events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recovered over its remaining service life 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when the sum of the estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  is less than the asset s carrying amount 
when impairment is indicated  an impairment charge is recorded based on an estimate of future cash flows on a discounted basis 
self insured risk accruals 
we are self insured up to retention limits with regard to workers compensation  general liability claims  and medical and dental coverage of our employees 
we generally maintain no physical property damage coverage on our workover rig fleet  with the exception of certain of our hour workover rigs and newly manufactured rigs 
we have deductibles per occurrence for workers compensation  general liability claims  and medical and dental coverage of million  million  and  respectively 
we have lower deductibles per occurrence for automobile liability 
we maintain accruals in our consolidated balance sheets related to self insurance retentions by using third party actuarial data and historical claims history 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when the services are performed  collection of the relevant receivables is probable  persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists and the price is fixed and determinable 
rig manufacturing revenue is recognized by individual rig based on the completed contract method 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in the period that includes the statutory enactment date 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recognized when it is more likely than not that the benefit of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
we analyze our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
depreciation and amortization 
in order to depreciate and amortize our property and equipment and our intangible assets with finite lives  we estimate the useful lives and salvage values of these items 
our estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
impairment of property and equipment 
our analysis for potential impairment of property and equipment requires us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows 
actual impairment charges are recorded using an estimate of discounted future cash flows 
the determination of future cash flows requires us to estimate rates and utilization in future periods and such estimates can change based on market conditions  technological advances in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
we analyze the potential impairment of property and equipment annually as of december or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the assets have decreased below the carrying value 
impairment of goodwill 
our goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized 
we assess impairment of goodwill annually as of december or on an interim basis if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset has decreased below its carrying value 
a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less that its carrying value is allowed but not required 
if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then the two step impairment test is performed 
in the two step test  first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
if impairment is indicated  then the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill is measured as the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
it is possible  depending upon a number of factors that are not determinable at this time or within the control of the company  that the fair value of any reporting unit could decrease in the future and result in an impairment to goodwill 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on an analysis of historical collection activity and specific identification of overdue accounts 
factors that may affect this estimate include changes in the financial positions of significant customers and a decline in commodity prices that could affect the entire customer base 
litigation and self insured risk reserves 
we estimate our reserves related to litigation and self insured risk based on the facts and circumstances specific to the litigation and self insured risk claims and our past experience with similar claims 
the actual outcome of litigation and insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts 
as discussed in self insured risk accruals above with respect to our critical accounting policies  we maintain accruals on our balance sheet to cover self insured retentions 
these accruals are based on certain assumptions developed using third party data and historical data to project future losses 
loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations  which involves the use of various assumptions 
these estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions  technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair value of property and equipment  intangible assets and the resulting amount of goodwill  if any 
we test annually for impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded in business combinations 
this requires us to estimate the fair values of our own assets and liabilities at the reporting unit level 
therefore  considerable judgment  similar to that described above in connection with our estimation of the fair value of an acquired company  is required to assess goodwill and certain intangible assets for impairment 
cash flow estimates 
our estimates of future cash flows are based on the most recent available market and operating data for the applicable asset or reporting unit at the time the estimate is made 
our cash flow estimates are used for asset impairment analyses 
stock based compensation 
we have historically compensated our directors  executives and employees through the awarding of stock options and restricted stock 
we accounted for stock option and restricted stock awards in  and using a grant date fair value based method  resulting in compensation expense for stock based awards being recorded in our consolidated statements of income 
for performance based restricted stock awards  compensation expense is recognized in our financial statements based on their grant date fair value 
we utilize i the closing stock price on the date of grant to determine the fair value of vesting restricted stock awards and ii a monte carlo simulation to criteria 
the monte carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input 
table of contents 
index to financial statements variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant and calculates the fair value of the award 
the expected volatility utilized in the model was estimated using our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of our peer companies 
the risk free interest rate was based on the us treasury rate for a term commensurate with the expected life of the grant 
stock options have not been issued since but are valued on the grant date using black scholes merton option pricing model and restricted stock issued is valued based on the fair value of our common stock at the grant date 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
because the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options are critical 
income taxes 
the amount and availability of our loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes are subject to a variety of interpretations and restrictive tests 
the utilization of such carryforwards could be limited or lost upon certain changes in ownership and the passage of time 
accordingly  although we believe substantial loss carryforwards are available to us  no assurance can be given concerning the realization of such loss carryforwards  or whether or not such loss carryforwards will be available in the future 
asset retirement obligations 
we record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and capitalize an equal amount as a cost of the asset  depreciating it over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation is adjusted at the end of each quarter to reflect the passage of time  changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation  acquisition or construction of assets  and settlement of obligations 
results of operations the results of operations between periods may not be comparable  primarily due to the significant decline in the oil and natural gas industry throughout and recovery throughout and  as well as the company s growth in asset base during and year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased by to billion in from billion in this increase was primarily due to the recovery of the oil and gas industry in and overall stabilization through most  notwithstanding lower natural gas commodity prices
