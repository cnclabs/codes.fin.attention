table of contents item a 
risk factors we may from time to time make written or oral statements that contain forward looking information 
however  our actual results may differ materially from our expectations  statements or projections 
the following risks and uncertainties  together with other factors not presently determinable  could cause actual results to differ from our expectations  statements or projections 
general factors we have a history of operating losses and have used increasing amounts of cash for operations and to fund our acquisitions and investments 
despite the gain on our sale of coalogix in  we have a history of operating losses  and have used significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities over the years 
in  and  we had operating losses of million  million and million  respectively 
cash used in operating activities of continuing operations in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions and investment opportunities and expect to continue to support at least a portion of the financing needs of our subsidiaries 
while we currently have enough cash on hand to fund our operations for the next months  we may need additional funds to finance future investment and acquisition activity we wish to undertake 
we do not know if such funds will be available if needed on terms that we consider acceptable 
we may have to limit or adjust our investment acquisition strategy in order to continue to pursue our corporate goals 
we believe that our current cash plus the cash generated from operations and borrowing from available lines of credit  if necessary  will provide more than sufficient liquidity to finance the operating activities of acorn and the operations of its operating subsidiaries at their current level of operations for the foreseeable future and for the next months in particular 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of potential market expansion or complimentary acquisitions for our existing businesses  we are contemplating whether and on what terms we may offer additional securities for sale in the future 
we currently expect that we may conduct such an offering sometime during  the amount and terms of which cannot be determined at this time 
the ongoing instability in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the ongoing global financial crisis may limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital  which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions 
accordingly  if the global financial crisis and current economic downturn continue or worsen  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends 
in october  our board of directors adopted a dividend policy pursuant to which acorn expected to pay quarterly dividends on our common stock 
we intend to continue to pay such dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our board of directors that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders and are in compliance with all laws and agreements of acorn applicable to the declaration and payment of cash dividends 
future dividends may be affected by  among other factors our views on potential future capital requirements for investments in our subsidiaries  use of cash to consummate acquisition transactions  stock repurchase programs  changes in federal and state income tax laws or corporate laws  and changes to our business model 
our dividend payments may change from time to time  and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends in any particular amounts or at all 
a reduction in our dividend payments could have a negative effect on our stock price 

table of contents we depend on key management for the success of our business 
our success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of our senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of john a 
moore  our ceo  benny sela  ceo of dsit  lindon shiao  ceo of gridsense  deena redding  ceo of omnimetrix and jim andersen  ceo of ussi and other key management level employees 
the loss of the services of any of these key employees could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of these employees other than for our ceo  john a 
moore 
although to date we have been successful in retaining the services of senior management and have entered into employment agreements with them  members of our senior management may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods 
we may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for our senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
loss of the services of a few key employees could harm our operations 
we depend on key technical employees and sales personnel 
the loss of certain personnel could diminish our ability to develop and maintain relationships with customers and potential customers 
the loss of certain technical personnel could harm our ability to meet development and implementation schedules 
the loss of key sales personnel could have a negative effect on sales to certain current customers 
although most of our significant employees are bound by confidentiality and non competition agreements  the enforceability of such agreements cannot be assured 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
if we fail to attract or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future  our business could be disrupted 
our vice president of external relations assists in certain legislative and other governmental relations matters such activities and the activities of other personnel may be deemed to be lobbying efforts 
to the extent that our vice president of external relations engages in activities that constitute lobbying under federal  state  or local laws  we have to register him and possibly ourselves and one or more of our subsidiaries under such applicable laws 
in addition  some states have so called procurement lobbying rules that require sales personnel who interact with governmental officials in certain sales activities to register as lobbyists as well 
lobbying laws typically require periodic financial and other reports to be timely made and prohibit some types of contributions  gifts and other expenditures by lobbyists and their affiliates 
any failure to register or to comply with the applicable regulations could subject us  our employees and officers and directors to civil or criminal penalties 
we intend to comply with such laws 
our awards of stock options to employees may not have their intended effect 
a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel has historically included the award of options to buy our common stock or the common stock of our subsidiaries 
if the price of our common stock performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance  public disclosure and financial accounting standards may result in additional expenses and affect our reported results of operations 
keeping informed of  and in compliance with  changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance  public disclosure and accounting standards  including the sarbanes oxley act  dodd frank act  as well as new and proposed sec regulations and accounting standards  has required an increased amount of management attention and external resources 
compliance with such requirements may result in increased general and administrative expenses and an increased allocation of management time and attention to compliance activities 
new regulations related to conflict free minerals may force us to incur additional expenses 
the sec released final rules in august regarding mandatory disclosure by public companies of sourcing information related to their use of conflict minerals tantalum  tin  tungsten and gold originating in the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries 
assuming the rules remain effective  we will be required to conduct specified due diligence activities for the calendar year  and provide our first report in may recently  a challenge to the rules was filed by the national association of manufacturers and the us chamber of commerce in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia 
the outcome of such litigation cannot be determined  but if the rules remain in force in substantially their current form  we will have to determine whether conflict minerals are necessary for the functionality of any of our products  and if so  undertake steps to determine their 
table of contents origin 
we anticipate that fulfilling our compliance obligations with the rules will be both time consuming and potentially costly 
although the exact amount cannot be determined at this time  commentators have suggested compliance could costs companies like ours as much as several hundreds of thousands of dollars per year 
although we anticipate that our costs will be substantially lower  we may also incur additional expenses related to any changes to our products we may decide are advisable based upon our due diligence findings  as well as increased supply costs as alternative supply sources may not be competitively priced 
we may not be able to successfully integrate companies which we may invest in or acquire in the future  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
part of our business model includes the acquisition of new companies either as new platform companies such as omnimetrix in february or complimentary companies for our subsidiaries 
any failure to effectively integrate any future acquisition management into our controls  systems and procedures could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our strategy is to continue to integrate our newly acquired companies and grow the businesses of all of our companies 
integrating acquisitions is often costly  and we may not be able to successfully integrate our acquired companies with existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other adverse operational or financial consequences 
integrating acquired companies involves a number of risks that could materially and adversely affect our business  including failure of the acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  inability to retain key personnel of the acquired companies  dilution of existing stockholders  potential disruption of our ongoing business activities and distraction of our management  difficulties in retaining business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired companies  difficulties in coordinating and integrating overall business strategies  sales and marketing  and research and development efforts  and the difficulty of establishing and maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  including accounting controls and procedures 
in order to grow  one or more of our companies may decide to pursue growth through acquisitions 
any significant acquisition by one or more of our operating companies could require substantial use of our capital and may require significant debt or equity financing 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing or its effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we incur substantial costs as a result of being a public company 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting  and other expenses in connection with our reporting requirements 
the sarbanes oxley act of  dodd frank act and the rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission sec and nasdaq  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these rules and regulations have already increased our legal and financial compliance costs and the amount of time and effort we devote to compliance activities 
we expect that as a result of continued compliance with these rules and regulations  we will continue to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs 
we continue to regularly monitor and evaluate developments with respect to these new rules with our legal counsel  but we cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
we may in the future become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us 
from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 
goodwill recorded in connection with our acquisitions is subject to mandatory annual impairment evaluations and as a result  we could be required to write off some or all of this goodwill  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with applicable accounting principles  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually or more frequently for impairment and other intangibles are also reviewed if certain conditions exist 
while we have not recorded an impairment of 
table of contents goodwill during the years ended december  or  during the year ended december   we recorded a million impairment of goodwill associated with our former coreworx subsidiary following our decision to stop funding it and an impairment of million associated with our gridsense segment 
any additional impairment of the value of goodwill will result in an additional charge against earnings which could materially adversely affect our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
while we have not reported any material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in the past  we cannot assure you that material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures are not effective  there may be errors in our financial statements that could require a restatement or our filings may not be timely and investors may lose confidence in our reported financial information 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in each annual report on form k 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons  by collusion of two or more people  or by management override of the controls 
over time  controls may become inadequate because changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may occur 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
as a result  we cannot assure you that significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  cause us to fail to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations  or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules promulgated thereunder 
the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to timely meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  or our intellectual property protection efforts are unsuccessful  others may duplicate our technology 
our operating companies rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology  systems designs and manufacturing processes 
the ability of others to use our intellectual property could allow them to duplicate the benefits of our products and reduce our competitive advantage 
we do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will be issued or  in the case of patents issued  that the claims allowed are or will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology or processes 
further  a patent issued covering one use of our technology may not be broad enough to cover uses of that technology in other business areas 
even if all our patent applications are issued and are sufficiently broad  they may be challenged or invalidated or our competitors may independently develop or patent technologies or processes that are equivalent or superior to ours 
we could incur substantial costs in prosecuting patent and other intellectual property infringement suits and defending the validity of our patents and other intellectual property 
while we have attempted to safeguard and maintain our property rights  we do not know whether we have been or will be completely successful in doing so 
these actions could place our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights at risk and could result in the loss of patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights protection for the products  systems and services on which our business strategy partly depends 
furthermore  it is not practical from a cost benefit perspective to file for patent or trademark protection in every jurisdiction where we now or in the future may conduct business 
in those territories where we do not have the benefit of patent or trademark protections  our competitors may be able to prevent us from selling our products or otherwise limit our ability to advertise under our established product names and we may face risks associated with infringement litigation as discussed below 
we rely  to a significant degree  on contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge 
these trade secrets either cannot be protected by patent protection or we have determined that seeking a patent is not in our interest 
these 
table of contents agreements may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
our trade secrets may also be known without breach of such agreements or may be independently developed by competitors 
third parties may claim that we are infringing their intellectual property  and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products and services if these claims are successful 
we also may incur significant expenses in affirmatively protecting our intellectual property rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights in many technology related industries and we believe that the industries in which certain of our subsidiaries operate have a significant amount of patent activity 
third parties may claim that the technology or intellectual property that we incorporate into or use to develop  manufacture or provide our current and future products  systems or services infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of their intellectual property rights  and we may be found to infringe  induce or contribute to the infringement of those intellectual property rights and may be required to obtain a license to use those rights 
we may also be required to engage in costly efforts to design our products  systems and services around the intellectual property rights of others or incur additional marketing costs if we are prevented from using existing product names 
the intellectual property rights of others may cover some of our technology  products  systems and services 
in addition  the scope and validity of any particular third party patent may be subject to significant uncertainty 
litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements or to indemnify our customers 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
any inability on our part to obtain needed licenses could delay or prevent the development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we may also be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development  manufacture and sale of our products  systems or services 
we also may be required to incur significant time and expense in pursuing claims against companies we believe are infringing or have misappropriated our intellectual property rights 
it can be difficult or expensive to obtain the insurance we need for our business operations 
as part of our business operations  we maintain insurance both as a corporate risk management strategy and to satisfy the requirements of many of our contracts 
insurance products are impacted by market fluctuations and can become expensive and sometimes very difficult to obtain 
there can be no assurance that we can secure all necessary or appropriate insurance at an affordable price for the required limits 
our failure to obtain such insurance could lead to uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition  or cause us to be out of compliance with our contractual obligations 
we may in the future be involved in product liability and product warranty claims relating to the products we manufacture and distribute that  if adversely determined  could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods  regardless of the ultimate outcome 
claims of this nature could also have a negative impact on customer confidence in our products and our company 
while insurance can mitigate some of this risk  due to our current size and limited operating history  we have been unable to obtain product liability insurance with significant coverage limits 
our customers may not accept the terms we have been able to procure and seek to terminate our existing contracts or cease to do business with us 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject the company to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  short term deposits  restricted deposits and accounts receivable 
the company s cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash deposits were deposited with us  israeli and australian banks and other financial institutions and amounted to million at december  the company uses major banks and brokerage firms to invest its excess cash  primarily in money market funds 
the counterparty to the company restricted deposits are two major israeli banks 
the company does not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
related credit risk would result from a default by the financial institutions or issuers of investments to the extent of the recorded carrying value of these assets 
approximately of the accounts receivable at december   were due from one customer which pays its receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising the company s customer base 
approximately of the balance in unbilled revenue at december  was due from two 
table of contents customers that when billed  pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of unbilled revenue is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
results from our past successful sales of subsidiary companies may not be repeated in the past  we have sold certain former subsidiaries comverge and coalogix at a profit  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to repeat these successes with one or more of our current subsidiaries 
we invest in companies before they have a meaningful history of revenues and whether we can operate these entities successfully or realize any profit on our investments in them cannot be determined 
risks related to dsit solutions failure to accurately forecast costs of fixed priced contracts could reduce dsit margins 
when working on a fixed price basis  dsit undertakes to deliver software or integrated hardware software solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are primarily determined by dsit success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  dsit costs are substantially higher than expected  it may incur losses on fixed price contracts 
hostilities in the middle east region may slow down the israeli high tech market and may harm dsit operations 
dsit operations are conducted in israel 
accordingly  political  economic and military conditions in israel may directly affect dsit 
any increase in hostilities in the middle east involving israel could weaken the israeli hi tech market  which may result in a deterioration of the results dsit operations 
in addition  an increase in hostilities in israel could cause serious disruption to dsit operations if acts associated with such hostilities result in any serious damage to its offices or those of its customers or harm to its personnel 
furthermore  the mandatory military commitments of some dsit personnel may temporarily impact our ability to produce our products on a timely basis if such personnel are called into service in connection with hostilities or otherwise 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of dsit operations 
a majority of dsit s sales are based on contracts or orders which are in u 
s dollars or are in new israeli shekels nis linked to the us dollar 
at the same time  most of dsit s expenses are denominated in nis primarily labor costs and are not linked to any foreign currency 
the net effect of a devaluation of the us dollar relative to the nis is that dsit s costs in dollar terms increases more than its revenues 
dsit enters into forward contracts to try to mitigate its exposures to exchange rate fluctuations  however  we can provide no assurance that such controls will be implemented successfully 
in the nis strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
dsit is substantially dependent on a small number of customers and the loss of one or more of these customers may cause revenues and cash flow to decline 
in  approximately of dsit s revenues were concentrated in two customers 
these customers are expected to continue to make up a significant portion of dsit s revenues and cash flow for a significant reduction of future orders or delay in milestone payments from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the performance of dsit 
dsit is dependent on meeting milestones to provide cash flow for its operations 
dsit operations place a great reliance on it meeting project milestones in order to generate cash flow to finance its operations 
should dsit encounter difficulties in meeting significant project milestones  resulting cash flow difficulties could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
dsit must at times provide significant guarantees in order to secure projects 
these guarantees are often collateralized by restricted deposits 
some of the projects dsit performs require significant performance and or bank guarantees 
at december   dsit had million of performance and bank guarantees outstanding 
in addition  dsit had on deposit at two israeli banks 
table of contents approximately million collateralizing some of these guarantees 
these deposits are restricted and  accordingly  dsit cannot use these funds for operations until the guarantees which are being collateralized are released 
at times  this can create cash flow difficulties which could have a material adverse effect on its operations 
in addition  dsit may not always be able to supply such guarantees or restricted deposits without financial assistance from acorn 
if acorn needs to provide financial guarantees for dsit  acorn may not have sufficient funds available to it to invest in other emerging ventures or take advantage of opportunities available to it in a timely manner 
if dsit is unable to keep pace with rapid technological change  its results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
some of dsit solutions are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and technological obsolescence 
dsit competitiveness and future success depends on its ability to keep pace with changing technologies and industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
a fundamental shift in technologies could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position 
a failure to react to changes in existing technologies could materially delay dsit development of new products  which could result in technological obsolescence  decreased revenues  and or a loss of market share to competitors 
to the extent that dsit fails to keep pace with technological change  its revenues and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
dsit is dependent on a number of suppliers who provide it with components for some of its products 
a number of dsit suppliers provide it with major components for some of its products for the energy security sonar solutions segment 
some of these components are long lead items 
if for some reason  the suppliers cannot provide dsit with the component when it is needed and dsit cannot easily find substitute suppliers on similar terms  dsit may have increased costs and or delays in delivering a product to a customer and incur penalties and lose customer confidence 
in addition  project delays can also slow down revenue recognition and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
while dsit is constantly attempting to develop secondary suppliers for these components  it can provide no assurance that it will be successful in doing so on acceptable terms 
dsit is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of dsit current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with dsit existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
dsit is negotiating with ussi a transfer of technology agreement whereby dsit would receive from ussi an exclusive world wide license to use ussi technology to provide systems  devices  installations and methods for monitoring ground sites  facilities  locations and perimeters and against land based security threats for government and non government customers for defense  security or military and safety applications 
dsit is currently investing significant amounts of capital in creating the infrastructure to support the transfer of technology and any final agreement with ussi may involve significant payments to ussi for the license to use the ussi technology 
we have no assurance that the transfer of technology will be completed within the expected time frame or budget currently anticipated  or that we will be able to obtain any necessary export licenses from the us authorities on acceptable terms or at all 
we further have no assurance that following the completion of the transfer of technology  that dsit will successfully be able to integrate it into its portfolio of products and be able to commercialize the applications 
dsit is planning to expend significant resources to integrate its active sonar diver detection system with ussi fiber optic sensors to create an active passive sonar diver detection system pauss as well as working to develop fiber optic land based perimeter security systems 
work on the pauss project has begun  but continued development will require ussi to obtain certain export licenses from either the us department of commerce or state department and whether such licenses can be obtained on a timely basis or terms cannot be determined 
the bird foundation grant is designated to cover of the development costs of the project over a period of two years 
payment of the grant is dependent on continued progress being made in accordance with a contractually agreed upon time line 
furthermore  we have no assurance that the development of these systems will be completed within the 
table of contents expected time frame or budgets 
we further have no assurance that if dsit successfully develops these systems  that dsit will successfully be able to commercialize the applications 
risks related to gridsense gridsense has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
gridsense incurred net losses for the years ended december   and we believe that gridsense will reduce its losses in  however  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
gridsense will need additional financing to grow and finance its operations in  we invested million in gridsense and gridsense signed a loan and security agreement with a bank and received a million line of credit 
however  we expect that gridsense will continue to require working capital support in to finance its operations in as it works to grow its revenues through march   we have invested an additional  out of a committed investment of million see liquidity and capital resources in gridsense 
we have no assurance whether and to what extent gridsense will have access to the entire million facility given that the availability is subject to a calculated borrowing base as well as certain financial and other covenants 
additional support to gridsense may be in the form of an additional or expanded bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
gridsense s products and services may not gain market acceptance or competitors may introduce offerings that surpass those of gridsense 
the primary market for gridsense s products and services is rapidly evolving which means that the level of acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release by the marketplace is not certain 
if the markets for gridsense s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become subject to intense competition  its business will suffer 
as a result  gridsense may be unable to i successfully market its current products and services  ii develop new products  services and enhancements to current products and services  iii complete customer installations on a timely basis or iv complete products and services currently under development 
if gridsense s products and services are not accepted by its customers or by other businesses in the marketplace  gridsense s business and operating results will be materially affected 
in addition  we can provide no assurance that gridsense will be successful in deriving significant revenue growth through its current strategy and marketing initiatives 
gridsense s products are subject to regulatory approvals 
numerous regulations govern the manufacture and sale of gridsense s products in the united states and other countries where gridsense intends to market its products 
such regulation bears upon the approval of manufacturing techniques  testing procedures and approval for the manufacturing and sale of gridsense s products  including advertising and labeling 
any failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approvals would adversely affect our ability to market our products 
furthermore  product approvals may be withdrawn if problems occur following initial marketing or if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained 
the failure  delay or withdrawal of a previously given regulatory approval could materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial position 
sales to utilities are generally characterized by long sales cycles 
gridsense s sales are largely dependent on the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support 
the purchasing cycle for a utility may involve an evaluation trial or pilot  analysis of data and results  review of competitor s offerings and smaller scale deployments  before a purchasing decision is made 
for large orders  some utilities are required to solicit competitive bids from other vendors which can contribute significantly more time and result in lost sales opportunities 
at best  the sales cycle can take several months and in certain circumstances it can be a multi year process 
delays in securing purchase orders can materially adversely affect our revenues  cash flows and financial condition 

table of contents gridsense is attempting to broaden its revenue base by expanding into the north american market 
gridsense is currently recording a significant portion of its revenue from sales generated in australia more than in both and and more than for the calendar year 
gridsense believes that growth and profitability will require additional expansion of sales in other markets  most notably the north american market 
to the extent that gridsense is unable to expand sales into other markets in a timely and cost effective manner  its business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  even with the successful recruitment of additional personnel and international resellers  there can be no assurance that gridsense will be successful in maintaining or increasing international market demand for its products 
exchange rate fluctuations could increase the cost of gridsense s australian operations 
gridsense has operations in both the us and australia 
its australian operations are subject to the volatility of the australian dollar vis vis the us dollar in  the australian dollar strengthened by  in the australian dollar was virtually unchanged vis a vis the us dollar while in  the australian dollar strengthened by 
while risks are somewhat mitigated by the fact that gridsense s australian operation s sales and expenses are primarily denominated in australian dollars  currency fluctuations may impact the translation of certain balance sheet items  affect the economics of manufacturing and ultimately affect its financial performance 
during  gridsense transferred substantially all of its production lines to the us in order to minimize costs in australian dollars 
gridsense does not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
gridsense s market is subject to rapidly changing technologies 
gridsense markets its products in a field where electronics and software firmware dominate 
this fast changing area may generate unknown methods of detecting and monitoring disturbances that could render gridsense s technology inferior  resulting in gridsense s results of operations being materially adversely affected 
gridsense does  however  closely monitor trends and changes in technologies and customer demand that could adversely impact its competitiveness and overall success 
gridsense is subject to vigorous competition with very large competitors that have substantially greater resources and operating histories 
some of gridsense s competitors in the markets it serves are larger  better capitalized and have greater resources than gridsense 
as gridsense grows and penetrates markets where larger companies have been established  it may experience a reduced rate of growth due to competitive forces 
competition from these competitors may have a material adverse effect on our operations  including a potential reduction in operating margins and a loss of potential business 
some competitors such as power delivery product  sentient and cooper have products that directly compete with gridsense at comparable price points and features 
gridsense development costs and marketing costs to penetrate the market related to grid insite tm may be more than previously estimated 
gridsense is currently in the process of developing grid insite tm 
this product allows customers to monitor their networks on a system hosted by gridsense 
while development costs expended to date are in line with expectations  we have no assurance that the final grid insite tm product will be completed within the expected time frame or budget currently anticipated 
we further have no assurance that following the development of grid insite tm  that gridsense will successfully be able to integrate it into its portfolio of products and be able to commercialize the applications 
furthermore  grid insite tm may require different organizational skillset and resources to penetrate the market 
in contrast to gridsense traditional way of selling hardware and equipment  grid insite tm may give the company an opportunity to sell services and generate recurring revenue streams over time 
this model may require upfront investment by the company which will be recovered through subscription revenue collected overtime 
as with any new product introduction there is always a risk in pace of adoption by customers 
grid insite tm represents a new and unconventional way to sell to utilities 
while the gridsense believes that there is a market for hosted software solutions it is unknown how utilities will accept this new method of procuring services 
risks related to omnimetrix omnimetrix has incurred net losses since our acquisition and may never achieve sustained profitability 
omnimetrix incurred a net loss of million in since our acquisition of it and used million of cash in its operations 
we believe that omnimetrix will continue to report losses in and have negative cash from operations 
we can 
table of contents provide no assurance that omnimetrix will be able to generate sufficient revenues and cash flow to allow it to become profitable or to eventually sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
omnimetrix current business model is predicated on the penetration rate of its pg monitoring units into the pg market 
omnimetrix currently provides its pg monitoring units at minimal or no costs to certain customers in order to accelerate the penetration rate 
accordingly  it does not cover its hardware costs on these units and depends on these customers maintaining their monitoring service connections to fund the company future working capital needs 
this new business model has not yet been proven to be sustainable 
if the pace of demand for these pg units is greater than our expectations  omnimetrix will need additional working capital to finance its inventory requirements 
if the pace of the demand for these pg units is below our expectations  the service monitoring revenue received from these units may not be enough to cover the fixed expenses of the company 
an increase in customer terminations would negatively affect our business by reducing omnimetrix revenue or requiring us to spend more money to grow our customer base 
omnimetrix rate of customer terminations  or average customer churn in the period since our acquisition of them was 
our churn rate could increase in the future if customers are not satisfied with our service 
other factors  including increased competition from other providers  alternative technologies  and adverse business conditions may also influence our churn rate 
if we have an increase in our churn rate  we will have to acquire new customers on an ongoing basis just to maintain our existing level of customers and revenues 
as a result  marketing expenditures are an ongoing requirement of our business 
if our churn rate increases  we will have to acquire even more new customers in order to maintain our existing revenues 
we incur significant costs to acquire new customers  and those costs are an important factor in determining our net profitability 
therefore  if we are unsuccessful in retaining customers or are required to spend significant amounts to acquire new customers  our revenue could decrease and our operating results could be affected 
omnimetrix is a relatively small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of omnimetrix current and potential competitors have significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than it does 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with omnimetrix existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products which would allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
omnimetrix may not be able to access sufficient capital to support growth 
since our acquisition of omnimetrix in february  we invested million to support their growth and working capital needs 
omnimetrix is dependent on acorn ability and willingness to provide funding to support its business and growth strategy 
we have committed to an additional investment of million to omnimetrix in see liquidity and capital resources 
omnimetrix will be competing with other acorn subsidiaries for access to acorn capital and credit support 
whether acorn will have the resources necessary to provide funding  or whether alternative funds  such as third party loans  will be available at the time and on terms acceptable to acorn and omnimetrix cannot be determined 
additional support to omnimetrix may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  additional investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
omnimetrix is currently in discussions with a bank to provide working capital financing 
we have no assurance that such additional support will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner and on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from acorn may be limited by the investment and working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
omnimetrix is dependent on the services of certain key personnel 
omnimetrix success is largely dependent on the skills  experience and efforts of its senior management team and other key personnel 
in particular  its success depends on the continued efforts of deena redding  its ceo  and harold jarrett  its cto who is both a founder and its most experienced engineer 
the loss of the services of either of these key employees could materially harm omnimetrix business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
omnimetrix does not maintain key person life insurance policies on its employees other than for mr 
jarrett 
although to date omnimetrix has been successful in retaining the 
table of contents services of senior management and has entered into employment agreements with ms 
redding and mr 
jarrett  they may terminate their employment agreements without cause and with various notice periods 
omnimetrix may also not be able to locate or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for its senior management or key employees if their services were no longer available 
omnimetrix has substantially increased its personnel count and related expense since our acquisition and whether sales can support the increased overhead cannot be determined 
following acorn acquisition of omnimetrix  the number of employees grew from to during  in particular it increased the sales team to a total of full time professionals 
although the sales team compensation is partially commission based  it still incurs fixed base compensation and both variable and fixed employee benefit expenses 
whether future operations can support the increased personnel costs cannot yet be determined and in the interim  operating expenses are expected to significantly out pace revenues 
omnimetrix sells equipment and services which monitor third party products  thus its revenues are dependent on the continued sales of such third party products 
omnimetrix end user customer base is comprised exclusively of parties who have chosen to purchase either generators or cathodic protection systems 
omnimetrix has no ability to control the rate at which new generators or cp protection systems are acquired 
when purchases of such products decline  the associated need for omnimetrix products and services is expected to decline as well 
if omnimetrix is unable to keep pace with changing market or customer mandated product and service improvements  omnimetrix results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
many of omnimetrix existing products may require ongoing engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs 
there can be no assurance that omnimetrix will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the cellular networks used by omnimetrix are also subject to periodic technical updates that may require corresponding updates to  or replacement of  omnimetrix monitoring equipment 
cellular networks have evolved over time to offer more robust technical capabilities in both voice and data transmission 
at the present time  the changes from the so called g to g and g service have resulted in only limited service interruptions 
omnimetrix anticipates  however  that as these new capabilities come online  it will be necessary to have equipment that can readily interface with the newer cellular networks to avoid negative impacts on customer service 
not all of the costs associated with omnimetrix corresponding equipment upgrades can be passed on to customers and the increased expenses are expected to have a negative impact on omnimetrix operating results 
a substantial portion of omnimetrix revenues are expected to be generated not from product sales  but from periodic monitoring fees and thus it is continually exposed to risks associated with its customers financial stability 
omnimetrix sells on going monitoring services to both pg and cp customers 
it is therefore dependent on these customers continuing to timely pay service fees on an on going basis 
if a significant portion of these fees are not renewed from year to year  omnimetrix can expect to experience deterioration in its financial condition 
omnimetrix ability to provide  and to collect revenues from  monitoring services is dependent on the reliability of cellular networks not controlled by omnimetrix 
omnimetrix provides monitoring services through the use of cellular technology utilizing the networks of third party providers 
these providers generally do not warrant their services to either omnimetrix or the end users and any dropped transmissions could result in the loss of customer renewals and potential claims against omnimetrix 
while omnimetrix uses contractual measures to limit its liability to customers  there is no assurance that such limitations will be enforced or that customers will not cancel monitoring services due to network issues 
omnimetrix business is dependent on its ability to reliably store and manage data  but there can be no guarantee that it has sufficient capabilities to mitigate potential data loss in all cases 

table of contents the efficient operation of omnimetrix business is dependent on its information technology systems 
in addition  omnimetrix ability to assist customers in analyzing data related to the performance of such customers power and cathodic protection monitoring systems is an important component of its customer value proposition 
omnimetrix utilizes off site data servers  housed within a commercial data center utilizing accepted data and power monitoring and protection processes  but whether a data loss can be avoided cannot be assured in every case 
omnimetrix information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters  sabotage including theft and attacks by computer viruses or hackers  power outages  and computer systems  internet  telecommunications or data network failure 
any interruption of omnimetrix information technology systems could result in decreased revenue  increased expenses  increased capital expenditures  customer dissatisfaction and potential lawsuits  any of which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition 
omnimetrix is currently dependent on a single subcontractor for the assembly of its products for large bulk orders 
omnimetrix ability to deliver its products to its customers on a timely basis is dependent on the production processes of its selected subcontractor 
financial or production difficulties by such subcontractor following the placement of a large order could have a negative impact on omnimetrix ability to deliver its products timely and cause a loss of customer confidence 
although more than one subcontractor is qualified to produce omnimetrix components  omnimetrix may not be able to successfully make a change in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
any difficulties omnimetrix encounters as a result of its reliance on this subcontractor could have a material adverse effect on its operations and financial condition 
current omnimetrix internal systems are not robust enough to sustain our anticipated growth and we will face challenges in implementing new systems and training users while maintaining our culture and product standards since we acquired omnimetrix  the workforce has increased substantially and our product platform has expanded to include preventative analytics 
we are in the process of moving into a new office and assembly facility and if our sales plans meet anticipated goals  both our hardware sales volume and customer monitoring contracts will increase  placing greater demands on both personnel and financial reporting systems 
we have recently hired a chief information officer to help us expand and update the necessary information technology it platform and we are working internally to refine our sales  procurement and customer service functions 
whether we will be able to successfully keep pace with anticipated growth cannot be determined  and our failure to properly execute on the infrastructure initiatives we have underway could materially and negatively impact our financial performance if we are unable to meet customer demands 
while we believe our current financial reporting systems are adequate  we are also transitioning to more automated procedures and any failure during the transition or otherwise in implementing new accounting software could result in our inability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
risks related to ussi ussi has a limited operating history 
ussi was formed in november and has a limited operating history 
many of its products are at a research and development stage and substantial time  effort and financial resources will be required before it can become profitable 
ussi s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  especially one that is dependent on developing new products for the oil and gas and security industries 
the likelihood of ussi s success should be considered in light of the problems  expenses  difficulties  complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with establishing a new business such as uncertainty in product development  uncertainty in market acceptance of its products  competition  and changes in business strategy 
ussi has no assurance that it will be successful in its business activities 
ussi has incurred net losses and may never achieve sustained profitability 
since its inception  ussi has had annual operating losses 
ussi expects to continue to have operating losses for the year ending december  and possibly beyond as a result of increased operating expenses required to commence manufacturing and production and to expand its sales and marketing operations 
ussi can provide no assurance that it will ultimately generate sufficient revenues to allow it to become profitable  to sustain profitability or to have positive cash flows 
ussi will need additional financing to grow its business and finance its operations 
in the period since acorn initial investment in november through december  we have invested million directly in ussi 
in february  we committed to an additional investment of million in ussi see recent developments 
while ussi has reached agreement with a bank for a million line of credit in  we have no assurance that ussi s future capital needs will not exceed the amount of the credit line or the amounts of acorn new investment commitment 
table of contents to ussi or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow in the future to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources 
furthermore  we have no assurance whether and to what extent ussi will have access to the entire million bank facility given that the availability is subject to certain financial and other covenants 
ussi may need to raise additional funds if revenues fail to meet projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand  respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the direct issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to third parties  acorn s percentage ownership of ussi may be reduced 
in addition  should additional funds be needed  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to ussi 
if funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  ussi may not be able to fund its growth  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  this could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi is a small company with limited resources compared to some of its current and potential competitors  which may hinder its ability to compete effectively 
some of ussi s current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and broader name recognition than does ussi 
as a result  these competitors may have greater credibility with ussi s existing and potential customers 
they also may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than can ussi to its products  which would allow them to respond more quickly than ussi to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements 
if ussi is unable to keep pace with technological change  ussi s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows may suffer 
many of ussi s products are in the research and development stage 
in addition  some of ussi s existing products may require additional engineering and upgrades in conjunction with market developments as well as specific customer needs 
there can be no assurance that ussi will continue to be successful in its engineering efforts regarding the development of its products and future technological difficulties could adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
ussi has not yet proved its ability to manufacture its products in commercial quantities 
in order to be successful  ussi products must be manufactured in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost and must meet the specifications required by the customers regarding quality 
we believe that ussi space and manufacturing capabilities at its current facilities in chatsworth  california to be sufficient to handle a large increase in sales for the future 
ussi has increased its production staff and has purchased automation  control and tracking systems necessary to support larger scale production  but such systems have either not yet been fully tested or are not yet fully operational 
in addition to adding internal staffing and resources  ussi may consider potential opportunities to acquire third party manufacturing capacity through acquisition or contract manufacturing arrangements  and whether or when any will exist on terms acceptable to ussi cannot be determined 
whether such systems and the personnel with the skills to effectively operate them can be put in place to meet customer orders on a timely and high quality basis can also not be determined 
failure to do so could result in delays or failures in meeting customer demand  resulting in a loss of customer confidence and orders 
such difficulties could materially and adversely affect the business  results of operations and financial condition of ussi 
ussi is dependent on suppliers who provide it with key components for some of its products 
ussi products incorporate state of the art technologies 
as such  in many cases there are a limited number of suppliers of key components 
in particular  ussi currently relies on a single source for the development of its high end interrogators for some of its technologically advanced product offerings 
ussi has licensed very advanced technology from northrop grumman that was initially developed for us navy fiber optic sonar applications and intends to field its own high performance interrogator in while ussi is confident that it will be able to introduce the new interrogator in  any development delays could materially and adversely affect ussi business  results of operations and financial condition 
where possible  ussi attempts to develop secondary back up suppliers for key components 
ussi s targeted customers may be reluctant to try its alternative solution despite its increased reliability and lower cost 
potential customers may elect to continue to use the existing expensive and less reliable technologies given their familiarity of the existing products in the market 
the competition in ussi s markets may have superior resources and marketing ability which could lead to potential customers selecting existing products over ussi s products 
while ussi continues to develop its products and invest in marketing efforts accordingly  there is no assurance that ussi s products will be preferred in the market 
table of contents place relative to the competition with superior overall resources 
if the market place does not adopt ussi s products as anticipated  ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to accurately forecast costs of future fixed priced contracts could reduce ussi s margins 
ussi current proof of concept projects which generally produce negative gross margins due to non recurring engineering design costs nre associated with the proof of concept are expected to lead to follow on projects on a fixed price basis 
when working on a fixed price basis  ussi expects to undertakes to deliver solutions to a customer s specifications or requirements for a particular project 
the profits from these projects are expected to primarily be determined by ussi s success in correctly estimating and thereafter controlling project costs 
costs may in fact vary substantially as a result of various factors  including underestimating costs  difficulties with new technologies and economic and other changes that may occur during the term of the contract 
if  for any reason  ussi s costs are substantially higher than expected  ussi may incur losses on such fixed price contracts 
ussi may lose sales if it is unable to obtain government authorization to export its products 
the export of some of ussi s products may be subject to export controls imposed by the us government and administered by the us departments of state and commerce 
in certain instances  these regulations may require pre shipment authorization from the administering department 
for products subject to the export administration regulations ear administered by the department of commerce s bureau of industry and security  the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product  the final destination and the identity of the end user 
all ussi products that are exported are subject to ear  however  most of ussi s equipment is considered ear ear items generally consist of low technology consumer goods and do not require a license in many situations 
however  if ussi were to attempt to export an ear item to an embargoed country  to an end user of concern as defined by the us department of commerce or in support of a prohibited end use as defined by the us department of commerce  ussi would be required to obtain a license 
exports of certain ussi products may also be subject to the international traffic in arms regulations itar regulations administered by the department of state s directorate of defense trade controls and may require a license 
certain proposed exports of products and technical data by ussi to dsit in connection with the pauss project and related projects will require either an ear or itar license and it cannot be determined at this time if licenses will issue at all  on a timely basis or on acceptable terms 
obtaining export licenses generally can be difficult and time consuming 
failure to obtain export licenses could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect ussi s business  financial condition and results of operations 
compliance with us government regulations may also subject ussi to additional fees and costs 
the absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect ussi s competitive position 
limited protection of proprietary technology  risks of infringement ussi s success is heavily dependent upon its internally developed technology 
ussi has filed patents covering the specific use and novel inventions developed internally 
to further protect its proprietary rights  ussi relies on a combination of patent  trade secret  nondisclosure and other contractual restrictions 
as part of its confidentiality procedures  ussi enters into nondisclosure agreements with its employees  as well as select consultants and strategic partners and limit access to and distribution of its designs and proprietary information 
despite these efforts  ussi may be unable to effectively protect its proprietary rights 
in addition  the expense associated with the enforcement of ussi s proprietary rights may be substantial 
risks related to our securities our stock price is highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
during  our common stock has closed at prices as low as and as high as per share 
fluctuations in our stock price may continue to occur in response to various factors  many of which we cannot control  including general economic and political conditions and specific conditions in the markets we address  including the continued volatility in the energy industry and the general economy

in addition  the market prices of securities of energy related companies have been and remain volatile 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
our share price may decline due to the large number of shares of our common stock eligible for future sale in the public market including shares underlying warrants and options 
almost all of our outstanding shares of common stock are  or could upon exercise of options or warrants would become  eligible for sale in the public market as described below

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments acorn investment in ussi on february   we entered into a new stock purchase agreement the ussi purchase agreement with ussi pursuant to which we made a payment to ussi of million to purchase additional shares of ussi preferred stock 
the ussi preferred stock is the same class of shares that we acquired in and provides that upon any future liquidation of ussi  to the extent funds are available for distribution to ussi stockholders after the satisfaction of any ussi liabilities at that time  ussi would first repay us for the purchase price of our ussi preferred stock 
thereafter  we would receive a further payment for such shares ratably with all other ussi common stock holders as though our shares of ussi preferred stock were the same number of shares of ussi common stock 
following the february  payment to ussi  we owned approximately of ussi on an as converted basis 
the ussi purchase agreement contemplates that the company may make an additional investment of million later this year in exchange for more shares of ussi preferred stock 
if we fully fund that investment  we will own approximately of ussi on an as converted basis which amount would be diluted to approximately if all options which could be awarded under ussi stock purchase plan were awarded and exercised

table of contents overview and trend information the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect our business and operations 
certain of these factors are discussed in item a 
risk factors 
we operate in four reportable segments energy security sonar solutions through our dsit subsidiary  gridsense  power generation pg monitoring through our newly acquired omnimetrix subsidiary and ussi 
in addition  our other segment represents it and consulting activities at our dsit subsidiary as well as cathodic protection activities in our omnimetrix subsidiary 
the following analysis should be read together with the segment information provided in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
dsit solutions in  dsit continued its increased focus on marketing and developing its energy and security sonar solutions and products  particularly its products related to underwater security for energy and other strategic sites 
revenue of our dsit subsidiary increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was due to increased revenue in the energy security sonar solutions segment from million in to million in while certain it and consulting revenue which is included in our other segment was unchanged in as compared to fourth quarter revenue for dsit was million reflecting a slight decrease compared to fourth quarter revenue of million 
fourth quarter revenues were also above third quarter revenues million 
the increase in revenues was a direct result of dsit receipt of its largest order ever million for underwater security systems in late the sbs project 
the contract calls for the delivery and installation of a large number of aquashield diver detection sonar dds and pointshield portable diver detection sonar pdds systems to protect offshore oil platforms  coastal energy terminals and high value vessels against underwater intrusion and sabotage 
dsit began delivery of the systems in the fourth quarter of and in this order accounted for million or approximately of dsit revenue for the year 
the decrease in fourth quarter revenues compared to fourth quarter revenues was due to a decrease in non naval project revenue in the quarter 
the increase in fourth quarter revenues as compared to third quarter revenues was a result of increased progress on existing non dds naval projects and the receipt of new non naval projects 
gross profit in dsit in was million which reflects an increase of million or from million in the increase in the year on year gross profit was attributable to both increased revenues and gross margins in dsit s energy sonar security projects 
dsit s gross profit of million during the fourth quarter of was virtually unchanged from dsit s gross profit in the fourth quarter of as the increased revenues were offset by a slight decrease in gross margin 
fourth quarter gross profit also reflected an increase of million above third quarter gross profit million 
the increase in fourth quarter gross profit as compared to third quarter gross profit was also driven by increased revenues and gross margins in dsit s energy sonar security projects 
dsit gross margin in was  up from s gross margin of 
the increase in gross margin in was attributable to the relatively high margin revenue associated with the sbs project 
fourth quarter gross margin was as compared to in the fourth quarter of and in the third quarter of the increased gross margins in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of was due to increased margins in dsit non naval projects 
during  dsit recorded approximately million of research and development r d expense  an increase of approximately million compared to r d expense was million and million during the fourth quarters of and  respectively 
the increase is primarily attributable in part to work on joint development with ussi of the pauss next generation integrated passive active threat detection system for underwater site protection and efforts to expand dsit portfolio of products to include land based security fiber optic solutions 
dsit anticipates that its r d costs will continue at or above above its current levels for the foreseeable future 
in june  dsit together with ussi were awarded a joint  grant from the bird foundation for the joint development of the pauss next generation integrated passive active threat detection system for underwater site protection 
in october  a cooperation and project funding agreement was signed between the companies and the bird foundation which allows for the commencement of the funding which is expected to take place over a month period 
dsit anticipates receipt of approximately of the grant based on the expected allocation of project costs between dsit and ussi 
the first advance 
table of contents payment from the bird foundation of approximately  was received in october payment of the remainder of the grant is dependent on continued progress being made in accordance with a contractually agreed upon time line 
whether such funds will be forthcoming cannot be determined at this time during  dsit recorded approximately million of selling  general and administrative sg a expense as compared to approximately million recorded during fourth quarter sg a of million represents an increase of million compared to fourth quarter s sg a of million 
the increase in dsit sg a expense for the quarter on quarter periods is primarily attributable to increased marketing costs associated with product demonstrations in southeast asia 
dsit recorded a net income of million in million in and million in 
the increase of million from to was due to the increased gross profit million which resulted from both increased revenues and gross margins which was offset by increased developments costs million and sg a expenses million as well as increased income tax expenses million 
dsit s project backlog at december  was approximately million of which it expects to recognize approximately million in dsit expects to show modest revenue growth in compared to due to revenue it based upon its existing backlog and additional orders it expects to receive during dsit level of profitability in will be affected by anticipated increased development and marketing costs as dsit looks to expand its product portfolio and its marketing activities and its ability to receive significant new orders for its dds and pdds and other naval solution products during the year 
energy security sonar solutions during  and  revenues from our energy security sonar solutions segment in our dsit subsidiary were million  million and million  respectively  accounting for approximately  and of dsit s revenues for  and  respectively 
the balance of dsit s revenues of million  million and million for the years ending december   and were derived from dsit s other it and consulting activities which are included in acorn other segment activities 
this segment s revenues increased by million or in as compared to in  this segment s revenues decreased by million or as compared to the increase in revenues in was due to the receipt of the order for the sbs project in late and subsequent progress during segment gross profit increased in as compared to to million from million following a decrease in from from million in to million in the increased gross profit in as compared to was due to increased revenues of our energy and sonar solutions products combined with improved gross margins which increased from in to in the improved margins in were attributable to the previously mentioned sbs project 
we anticipate modest growth in revenue in from this segment 
growth is expected from our acoustic and sonar solutions projects based on our existing backlog with our revenues from embedded hardware and software development projects expected to remain relatively stable 
we anticipate new customers from new regions primarily asia based placing orders for our sonar and acoustic products in we do not anticipate recording significant revenues from land based security solutions in gridsense in  gridsense continued to focus on delivering solutions that address the power quality and reliability needs of utilities 
each of gridsense main product lines the line iq  cable iq  powermonic and transformer iq addresses different aspects of the power delivery system 
in addition to its existing product range  gridsense continues to invest in new technology which may lead to the commercialization of new products and revenue drivers for the business 
gridsense intends to expand its transformer monitoring capabilities and is expected to launch derivative products related to the transformeriq tm in future periods 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we began consolidating the results of gridsense beginning may   the date we acquired the outstanding gridsense shares not previously owned by us 
accordingly  full year results for were not included in acorn consolidated financial statements 
in  gridsense recorded revenues of million  a decrease of million from the million revenue recorded in in  gridsense revenues of million which more than doubled s full year revenues of million 
in  gridsense us operations contributed approximately million to gridsense total revenue compared to approximately million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease in revenues is attributable to the june 
table of contents order gridsense received from a leading electric utility in the southeastern usa to use its transformer iq to monitor over  transformers 
the order was completed in in  this customer provided gridsense with million of revenue as compared to in australia operations contributed approximately million of revenues in compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to approximately million of revenue recorded from a single customer in which provided negligible revenue in in addition  there were limited sales from three major utility customers in new south wales due to a restructuring by the state government to bring these three entities under a single new state owned corporation 
management expects spending from these three utilities to return to historical levels in gridsense s full year revenues by main product lines for  and are as follows in thousands of u 
s dollars powermonic line iq transformer iq other total revenues include revenues for the period prior to acorn acquisition of gridsense in may sales across all major product lines decreased in compared to the decline in revenue in the three major product categories is related to specific events 
the decline in powermonic sales is related to a restructuring by the australian government bringing three separate power utilities under a single state owned utility 
this event delayed purchases in we expect sales to return to levels in the line iq was a product in transition during the redesigned product was released at the end of pushing sales into we expect the volume of line iq sales in to exceed sales of the transformer iq also declined in as compared to the main factor was that included a large deployment of  units 
in  we received an order for over units  but that order did not ship until the first quarter of during we continued to track multiple pilot projects representing over a thousand units 
these pilots are with customers who have the potential need for tens of thousands of units 
while follow on orders from these pilots did not close in and the timing of these pilots depend on a number of variables  should our current opportunities become successful in we would expect sales to exceed levels 
the line iq product family has introduced a newly redesigned advanced sensor which improves both the functionality and price of its predecessor product 
this new sensor was made available to customers in the second half of during due to the improved cost of deploying this line monitoring system  utilities will be able to justify larger scale roll outs 
management expects increases in the size of deployment with existing line iq users as well as adoption by new utility customers 
the transformer iq was commercially introduced during during  gridsense was awarded a sizeable order by a us utility to monitor a fleet of over  transformers  validating the technology and market demand 
since fulfillment of this large order  gridsense has generated traction with other utility customers involving various applications of transformer monitoring 
management expects growth from new customers as a number of prospective utility customers are in various stages of evaluating transformeriq in pilots or trials 
in addition  increased marketing and sales efforts is expected to expand gridsense market penetration 
during gridsense was awarded an order of transformer iq units from another us investor owned utility 
this order was partially fulfilled in and is a significant part of gridsense backlog at december  while this order is significant  gridsense expects large follow on orders as the utility deploys the transformer iq across its entire fleet of transformers 
as gridsense continues to identify and develop new application and uses for the transformer iq platform  the company expects our use base to increase as it expands it pilot program for each of its applications 
while gridsense sees a general improvement in the overall business environment in the utility industry and expects utility spending to continue to increase in future quarters  the timing of such spending on products such as those that gridsense provides cannot be predicted with certainty due to the sales cycle of electric utilities which is typically long and requires much technical and application support 
to address these long sales cycles  gridsense has expanded its customer pilot programs from just a handful to over around the globe 
we expect that many of these paid pilot projects could result in substantial commercial rollouts in 
table of contents during  gross profit was million compared with s gross profit of million representing a decrease of million or from to the decrease in gross profit was attributable to a decrease in both revenues and gross margin 
gross margin decreased in to compared to in the decrease in gross margin is attributable to a combination of a number of factors 
a portion of the decrease was attributable to product delays of the latest version of the company line monitoring platform which resulted in the fulfillment of orders based on the higher costing predecessor product 
also  additional costs were incurred in freight as the company shifted production from its sydney facility to its sacramento facility 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an inventory charge of approximately  due to a write off of obsolete inventory and an increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory 
in future periods  we expect the gross margin percentage to rebound to historical levels or greater 
during  gridsense recorded million of r d expense as compared to million during fourth quarter r d expense was million compared to million in the fourth quarter of and million in the third quarter of during  gridsense added to its engineering team in order to accelerate the development of some key projects that gridsense believes will lead to the generation of new revenues 
we expect that r d expenses going forward will remain consistent with prior years 
during  gridsense recorded approximately million of sg a expense representing an increase of approximately million compared to sg a expense of million 
fourth quarter sg a expense of million reflects an increase of million from the fourth quarter of  but a decrease from the million recorded in the third quarter of the increased quarter on quarter sg a are primarily due to increased salary costs associated with additional sales  marketing  administrative and accounting staff as well as increased advertising and marketing related expenses  increased facility expenses and increased professional fees 
the decrease in sg a in the fourth quarter of as compared to the third quarter of was due to a reduction of our headcount in our staff in australia during the third quarter whose benefits were realized during the fourth quarter 
we do not expect sg a costs to change significantly in coming periods 
we expect that gridsense will continue to require working capital support while it focuses on increasing its sales 
acorn continues to provide funds for gridsense working capital needs and expects to do so in the future 
in the year ending december   acorn provided gridsense million for its working capital needs and an additional  out of a committed investment of million see liquidity and capital resources in the first two months of on august   gridsense signed a loan and security agreement with a bank to provide it with up to a million revolving line of credit subject to a calculated borrowing base 
gridsense recently made its first draw on the line of credit  in february the line of credit is subject to certain financial and other covenants 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us in gridsense may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
omnimetrix in accordance with applicable accounting standards  we began consolidating the results of omnimetrix beginning february   the date we acquired omnimetrix 
accordingly  there are no comparative results reported for omnimetrix for the three or twelve month periods ended december  during the period following our acquisition  we reported revenues of   in the fourth quarter and an operating loss of million million in the fourth quarter with respect to omnimetrix activities 
following further analysis of the recognition of certain revenues and costs of omnimetrix  we have reclassified first  second and third quarter revenues and costs of sales to defer hardware revenues and cost of sales in accordance with the accounting for multiple elements and recognizing those costs over expected customer life rather than at the delivery of the monitoring unit 
when we acquired omnimetrix  it had  pg units generating revenue while at the end of it had  pg units generating revenue 
since our acquisition  omnimetrix has engaged in developing a major marketing and promotion program to increase the penetration rate of its pg monitoring products into the market 
we anticipate that this promotion program  under which omnimetrix provides its pg monitoring units to certain customers below cost and or provides monitoring services at discounted prices  will provide sufficient monitoring cash flow to cover the working capital requirements of subsidizing pg monitoring units by the end of this promotional program began in the second half of and is expected to accelerate rapidly in during  omnimetrix recorded approximately  of research and development costs 
we anticipate that these costs will increase as we expand our product offering and develop solutions for other markets 
during  omnimetrix recorded approximately million of sg a costs of which approximately million was related to sales and marketing 
we anticipate that our sg a costs will increase significantly in as further develop our 
table of contents infrastructure to accommodate expected growth and expand our market presence 
omnimetrix has hired additional personnel since our acquisition growing from employees one of which was in sales to employees at february   of which are sales and marketing personnel 
while we anticipate continued personnel growth  we expect that the pace of personnel growth will taper off in the coming months 
omnimetrix currently has no other sources of financing other than its internally generated sales and investments by acorn 
to support omnimetrix marketing and promotion program  acorn has invested million into omnimetrix over the course of and has committed to investing an additional million in to be used in particular to grow its inventory of pg monitoring units in anticipation of increased deliveries of pg units to customers as a result of its marketing and promotion program 
as of february   omnimetrix had cash on hand of approximately  we have no assurance that omnimetrix will not need additional financing for working capital after we complete our million additional investment 
additional financing for omnimetrix may be in the form of a bank line  new investment by others  a loan or investment by acorn  or a combination of the above 
omnimetrix has begun discussions with a bank to provide working capital financing however  there is no assurance that such financing from the bank or any other party will be available in sufficient amounts  in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us in omnimetrix may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
ussi during  ussi reported revenues of million  an increase of million compared to revenues of million 
the increased revenues compared to revenues was attributable to the revenue recognized in on ten different projects  six of which were energy related proof of concept projects  whereas in  ussi recognized revenue on just five different projects  only two of which were energy related 
in addition  ussi continues to work on a million proof of concept project for sr inc  an independent services and technology company dedicated to the application of advanced borehole seismic methods 
the sr project is for a one hundred level ultra high sensitivity fiber optic based sensor system to be used for down hole seismic imaging and monitoring in the oil and gas industry 
the system will be used to provide improved down hole seismic imaging of both conventional and unconventional oil and gas fields with bottom hole temperatures up to degrees celsius throughout the united states and canada 
the revenue recognized in included two large proof of concept projects a commercial high temperature down hole fiber optic seismic array level array which is designed for monitoring wells that use the latest unconventional oil and gas extraction technique known as hydrofracking  and an ultra high sensitivity fiber optic based marine seismic array for oil and gas exploration to an international service provider for use as a marine array to aid in the collection and interpretation of data in the hostile environment of deep sea oil and gas operations 
these two contracts contributed approximately  to ussi revenue 
ussi revenue continues to be erratic due to the number and size of projects that ussi is able to complete and deliver during the quarterly periods 
fourth quarter revenues of  reflects a  decrease compared to fourth quarter revenues of  the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to technical difficulties in the sr project which did not allow for delivery during the quarter 
those technical difficulties have been cleared and delivery is expected in the first half of ussi full year revenues by main markets for  and are as follows in thousands of u 
s dollars oil gas commercial security defense total revenues include revenues for the period prior to acorn effective acquisition of ussi in february 
table of contents during  gross profit continued to be negative million as it was during 
the negative gross profit and its increase from is primarily due to large amounts of up front nre that accompanied the production of the first commercial high temperature down hole fiber optic seismic array level array 
similar nre accompanied ussi other proof of concept projects in ussi recorded negative gross profit in the fourth quarter of was  as compared to third quarter negative gross profit of  the increase in ussi negative gross profit was attributable to nre associated with proof of concept orders delivered in the fourth quarter 
ussi is continuing to work to develop cost cutting measures for the manufacturing of its commercial products  including investment in equipment that will make manufacturing more efficient and improving the production process and product designs that will ultimately result in less man hours required for each product sold 
we cannot at this time determine when the impact of these improved production processes and product designs will ultimately produce improved gross margins as each of our proof of concept projects has its own unique nre design costs associated with it 
we believe that upon receipt of a follow up order on one of our proof of concept projects  we will realize significantly greater efficiencies in production for that product 
during  ussi recorded approximately million of research and development r d expense as compared to million during during the fourth quarter of  ussi recorded approximately million of r d expense as compared to million in the fourth quarter the increased r d expense is due to an increase in engineering headcount as well as an increase in r d materials used in product development 
r d expense levels during were consistently at approximately million per quarter 
we expect r d expense to continue at current levels as ussi continues to internally develop more efficient production versions of its current products and to continue its development of multiple product offerings 
in june  ussi together with dsit were awarded a joint  grant from the bird foundation for the joint development of the pauss next generation integrated passive active threat detection system for underwater site protection 
in october  a cooperation and project funding agreement was signed between the companies and the bird foundation which allows for the commencement of the funding which is expected to take place over a month period 
ussi anticipates receipt of approximately of the grant based on the expected allocation of project costs between dsit and ussi 
the first advance payment from the bird foundation of approximately  was received in october payment of the remainder of the grant is dependent on continued progress being made in accordance with a contractually agreed upon time line 
whether such funds will be forthcoming cannot be determined at this time 
during  ussi recorded approximately million of sg a expense representing an increase of approximately million compared to fourth quarter sg a expense million also reflects an increase of million over fourth quarter sg a expense of million 
the increased sg a costs are due to increased sales and marketing activities combined with the costs of additional administrative personnel 
in addition  sg a costs of include approximately million of non cash stock compensation expense associated with ussi stock option plan million in the fourth quarter of 
excluding non cash stock compensation costs  we expect near term sg a costs to approximate those for the third quarter of as at december   ussi backlog of projects was approximately million which is comprised of its sr proof of concept project 
ussi anticipates recognizing the revenue associated with this projects over the next two quarters 
actual revenue recognition for this project may be over a longer period of time depending upon ussi ability to obtain delivery of raw materials with long lead times on a timely basis from its suppliers and control nre costs 
we continue to anticipate significant growth in orders  particularly from new customers related to our d reservoir and shale gas monitoring systems following the demonstrations performed during and prior years as well as follow on projects from our current proof of concept projects 
we believe that each of these proof of concept projects has the potential for annual multi million dollar follow up orders as early as the second half of in  we grew our employee base from full time employees inclusive of consultants at the end of to full time employees inclusive of consultants as of february  we also anticipate a leveling off of our growing personnel costs as the pace of our personnel growth is expected to slow down 
we expect that ussi will continue to require working capital support while it continues to transition from development to production and as it continues to work on refining its manufacturing capabilities 
during we invested million in ussi to support its working capital requirements and invested an additional million in february under our ussi purchase agreement see recent developments 
we anticipate that we will purchase an additional million in ussi preferred stock in rhe next few months 
the availability and amount of any additional investment from us in ussi may be limited by the working capital needs of our corporate activities and other operating companies 
while ussi has reached agreement with a bank for a million line of credit in  and ussi has in february ussi has accessed  of that line of credit  we have no assurance that ussi future capital needs will not exceed the amount of the credit line or the amounts of acorn investment commitment to ussi or that ussi will generate sufficient cash flow in the future to fund its operations in the absence of additional funding sources 
furthermore  we have no assurance whether and to what extent ussi will have access to the entire million 
table of contents bank facility given that the availability is subject to certain financial and other covenants 
ussi may need to raise additional funds if revenues fail to meet projections or to fund a rapid expansion to meet product demand  respond to competitive pressures or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the direct issuance of equity or convertible debt securities to third parties  acorn percentage ownership of ussi may be reduced 
in addition  should additional funds be needed  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to ussi 
if funds are not available  or are not available on acceptable terms  ussi may not be able to fund its growth  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of unanticipated acquisition opportunities 
accordingly  this could materially and adversely affect ussi s business  results of operations and financial condition 
corporate corporate general and administrative expense in reflected a million increase to million as compared to million of expense in the increase is due primarily to increased investor relation activities and personnel costs and bonuses as well as professional fees and costs incurred associated with our acquisition of omnimetrix approximately  in february fourth quarter corporate general and administrative expense was million reflecting a decrease of approximately million compared to the fourth quarter of the decrease in fourth quarter corporate general and administrative expense compared to fourth quarter s balance was due primarily to bonuses paid in the fourth quarter of with respect to the sale of coalogix partially offset by increased investor relation costs in the fourth quarter of fourth quarter corporate general and administrative expense was virtually unchanged compared to the third and second quarter corporate general and administrative expense approximately million in each quarter 
we expect our corporate general and administrative costs to decrease slightly from its current levels as we expect to incur less investor relation expenses going forward 
in  acorn recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million million with respect to the fourth quarter of with respect to a net operating loss carryback of its expected consolidated tax loss in 
table of contents critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion of critical accounting policies represents our attempt to report on those accounting policies  which we believe are critical to our consolidated financial statements and other financial disclosure 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies affecting our company principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies  business combinations  impairments in goodwill and intangible assets  revenue recognition  foreign currency transactions and stock based compensation 
principles of consolidation and investments in associated companies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
investments in other entities are accounted for using the equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership and or our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
investments of this nature are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investee s net income or losses after the date of investment 
when net losses from an investment accounted for under the equity method exceed its carrying amount  the investment balance is reduced to zero and additional losses are not recorded 
we resume accounting for the investment under the equity method when the entity subsequently reports net income and our share of that net income exceeds the share of net losses not recognized during the period the equity method was suspended 
investments are written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred 
as at december   we no longer have cost or equity basis investments 
in the year ending december   we began consolidating the results of ussi effective february  following the signing of option agreements with ussi and certain shareholders of ussi whereby we received options to acquire approximately of the company see note c to our consolidated financial statements 
we began consolidating the results of gridsense on may  following our acquisition of the approximately of the company we did not previously own see note b i to our consolidated financial statements 
on february   we began consolidating the results of omnimetrix llc  a georgia limited liability company following our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company membership interests see note a to our consolidated financial statements 
on december   we ceased consolidating the results of coreworx following the sale of all of our common stock in the company to a management buyout group consisting of coreworx management and certain employees and other investors see note b to our consolidated financial statements 
on august   we ceased consolidating the results of coalogix following the sale of all of our common stock in the company see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the results of coalogix and coreworx are presented as discontinued operations for all the periods since our acquisition of them in november and august  respectively 
business combination accounting we have acquired a number of businesses during the last several years  and we may acquire additional businesses in the future 
business combination accounting  often referred to as purchase accounting  requires us to determine the fair value of all assets acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  and liabilities assumed 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in amounts equal to the estimated fair value of each asset and liability  and any remaining acquisition cost is classified as an amortizable intangible asset  a non amortizable intangible asset or goodwill 
this allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
certain identifiable intangible assets  such as customer relationships and covenants not to compete  are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed over the intangible asset s estimated useful life 
the estimated useful life of our amortizable identifiable intangible assets ranges from three to twenty years 
goodwill is not amortized 
accordingly  the acquisition cost allocation and its subsequent amortization has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our current operating results 

table of contents goodwill and intangibles as a result of our various acquisitions  we have recorded goodwill and various amortizable intangible assets 
businesses acquired are recorded at their fair value on the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
our goodwill at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
our goodwill is allocated to our segments as follows energy security sonar solutions approximately million  gridsense approximately million  ussi approximately million  power generation million and cathodic protection which is included in our other segment approximately million 
our intangible assets that have finite useful lives are recorded at fair value at the time of the acquisition  and are carried at such value less accumulated amortization 
our net intangible asset balance at december  was approximately million representing approximately of our total assets 
the composition of our intangible assets at december  consisted of naval technologies in our energy security sonar solutions segment million  net of accumulated amortization  software and customer relationships in our gridsense segment million  net of accumulated amortization and sensor technologies and an acquired license in our ussi segment million  net of accumulated amortization  technologies  customer relationships and non compete agreements in our power generation segment million  net of accumulated amortization and technologies and customer relationships related to our cathodic protection activities which are included in our other segment million  net of accumulated amortization 
we amortize these intangible assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
each of our reportable operating segments energy security sonar solutions  gridsense  ussi and power generation is deemed to be a reporting unit 
these reporting units have been identified based on appropriate accounting principles  which considers  among other things  the manner in which we operate our business and the availability of discrete financial information 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are assigned to a reporting unit as of the date of acquisition 
in the event we reorganize our business  we reassign the assets including goodwill and liabilities among the affected reporting units 
our corporate activities and those relating to our non reporting segment are not assigned to our reporting units 
we periodically review these reporting units to ensure that they continue to reflect the manner in which the business is operated 
we also analyze whether any indicators of impairment for goodwill and intangibles exist each quarter 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include a sustained  significant decline in our share price and market capitalization  a decline in our expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of our long lived assets  and or slower growth rates  among others 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment 
this guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after december   and early adoption is permitted 
as discussed more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements  we early adopted this guidance for our annual goodwill impairment test that was conducted in the fourth quarter of if we had determined that it was necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test  we would determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions by management 
to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  there is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and a second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized  if any 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  we conduct a second step  in which we calculate the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the calculated implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets such as the assembled workforce as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of assessment and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using discounted expected future cash flows 
we perform a valuation analysis  utilizing an income approach in our goodwill assessment process 
the following describes the valuation methodology typically used to derive the fair value of our reporting units 
income approach to determine each reporting unit s estimated fair value  we discount the expected cash flows of our reporting units 
we estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends  estimated future operating results  growth rates  anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions  and the availability of necessary technology 
the discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital  which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model  we use a terminal value approach 
under this approach  we use estimated operating income before depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model  adjust it to estimate a normalized cash flow  apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value 
we incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value 
the preparation of the long range forecasts  the selection of the discount rates and the estimation of the multiples used in valuing the terminal year involve significant judgments 
changes to these assumptions could affect the estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
for  as required  the company performed an annual impairment test of recorded goodwill during the fourth quarter or earlier if impairment indicators or triggering events are present 
as previously noted  in september  the fasb issued guidance that simplified how entities test for goodwill impairment by permitting entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a two step goodwill impairment test 
in performing the goodwill impairment test for each of our ussi  energy security sonar solutions  power generation and cathodic protection which is included in our other segment reporting units  we assessed the relevant qualitative factors and concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units are greater than their carrying amounts 
after reaching this conclusion  no further testing was performed 
the qualitative factors we considered included  but were not limited to  general economic conditions  industry and market conditions  pipeline and backlog  our recent and projected financial performance and the price of the company common stock 
for our gridsense reporting unit  we quantitatively evaluated the goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair values of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of the gridsense reporting unit used in the analysis exceeded its carrying values by approximately approximately million or 
should certain assumptions used in the development of the fair values of our reporting unit change in the coming quarters  we may be required to recognize future goodwill impairment 
revenue recognition revenue from time and materials service contracts  maintenance agreements and other services is recognized as services are provided 
in the year ended december   we recorded approximately million of revenues representing approximately of our consolidated revenues in our dsit subsidiary 
in  dsit derived approximately million or of its revenues from fixed price type contracts 
fixed price type contracts require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized for a particular period  using the percentage of completion method as costs primarily direct labor are incurred  with revisions to estimates reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future revenue and margins may be significantly and negatively affected and losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting changes in revenues and reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
in  gridsense recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year 
revenue from sales of gridsense monitoring equipment is recognized at the time title to the equipment and significant risks of ownership pass to the customer  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably 
table of contents assured 
revenue from customer support services on monitoring equipment includes sales of parts and servicing of equipment 
sales of parts revenue is recognized when the parts are shipped to the customer or when the part is installed in the customer equipment

in  ussi recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year 
revenue from sales of ussi equipment is recognized at the time title to the equipment and significant risks of ownership pass to the customer which is generally upon shipment and or customer acceptance  when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection is reasonably assured 
in  omnimetrix recorded approximately million of revenue representing approximately or our consolidated revenue for the year 
of the million of revenue  million or represents the revenue from the sales of monitoring units and million or represents the revenue recognized from the monitoring fees 
sales of omnimetrix monitoring systems may have multiple elements  including equipment  installation and monitoring services 
omnimetrix equipment and related installations do not qualify as a separate unit of accounting 
as a result  revenues and related costs associated with sale of equipment and related installations are recorded to deferred revenue and deferred charges once delivery  installation and customer acceptance is completed 
revenue and related costs with respect to the sale of equipment and related installations are recognized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
revenues from the prepayment of monitoring fees generally paid months in advance are initially recorded as deferred revenue upon receipt of payment from the customer and then amortized to revenue over the monitoring service period 
foreign currency transactions the currency of the primary economic environment in which our corporate headquarters and our us subsidiaries operate is the united states dollar dollar

stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense based on the fair value recognition provision of applicable accounting principles  using the black scholes option valuation method 
accordingly  we are required to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award and to recognize that cost over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the black scholes method  we make assumptions with respect to the expected lives of the options that have been granted and are outstanding  the expected volatility and the dividend yield percentage of our common stock and the risk free interest rate at the respective dates of grant 
for our acorn options  the expected volatility factor used to value stock options in was based on the historical volatility of the market price of the company s common stock over a period equal to the estimated weighted average life of the options 
for the expected term of the option  we used an estimate of the expected option life based on historical experience 
the risk free interest rate used is based upon us treasury yields for a period consistent with the expected term of the options 
our expected dividend rate was based upon our quarterly dividend of per share 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period 
due to the numerous assumptions involved in calculating share based compensation expense  the expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements may differ significantly from the value realized by employees on exercise of the share based instruments 
in accordance with the prescribed methodology  we do not adjust our recognized compensation expense to reflect these differences 
recognition of stock based compensation expense had  and will likely continue to have  a material effect on our selling  general and administrative and other items within our consolidated statements of operations and also may have a material effect on our deferred income taxes and additional paid in 
table of contents capital line items within our consolidated balance sheets 
we are also required to use judgment in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from the original estimate  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
in  our ussi subsidiary adopted the ussi stock option plan to be administrated by the board of directors of ussi 
in september  ussi granted options to purchase  of its common shares  to senior management  employees  outside directors and a consultant of ussi under the plan

historically  a majority of dsit s sales have been denominated in dollars or denominated in nis linked to the dollar 
such sales transactions are negotiated in dollars  however  for the convenience of the customer they are often settled in nis 
these transaction amounts are linked to the dollar between the date the transactions are entered into until the date they are effected and billed 
from the time these transactions are effected and billed through the date of settlement  amounts are primarily unlinked 
as dsit increases its sales to customers outside of israel  a greater portion of its receipts from customers will be settled in dollars 
in  we expect an increasing portion of dsit s sales to be settled in dollars 
a significant majority of dsit s expenses in israel are in nis primarily labor costs  while a portion is in dollars or dollar linked nis 
the dollar cost of our operations in israel may be adversely affected in the future by a revaluation of the nis in relation to the dollar

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk general we are required to make certain disclosures regarding our financial instruments  including derivatives  if any 
a financial instrument is defined as cash  evidence of an ownership interest in an entity  or a contract that imposes on one entity a contractual obligation either to deliver or receive cash or another financial instrument to or from a second entity 
examples of financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  deposits  trade accounts receivable  loans  investments  trade accounts payable  accrued expenses  options and forward contracts 
the disclosures below include  among other matters  the nature and terms of derivative transactions  information about significant concentrations of credit risk  and the fair value of financial assets and liabilities 
foreign currency risk the translation of the balance sheets of our israeli operations from nis into us dollars is sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as are the balance sheets of our australian operations from australian dollars into us dollars 
these translation gains or losses are recorded either as cumulative translation adjustments cta within stockholders equity  or foreign exchange gains or losses in the statement of operations 
in the nis strengthened in relation to the us dollar by 
in the australian dollar strengthened relative to the us dollar by 
to test the sensitivity of these operations to fluctuations in the exchange rate  the hypothetical change in cta and foreign exchange gains and losses is calculated by multiplying the net assets of these non us operations by a change in the currency exchange rates 
as of december   a weakening of the us dollar against the nis and against the australian dollar would have increased stockholders equity by approximately  arising from a cta adjustment of approximately  and net exchange losses of approximately 
these hypothetical changes are based on adjusting the december  exchange rates by 
our dsit subsidiary enters into various forward contracts which do not qualify as hedging instruments under accounting principles to try to mitigate its foreign currency exposure risks 
at december   dsit had entered into monthly forward contracts through june to sell us dollars  per month at exchange rates ranging from to in order to mitigate risk to its nis denominated expenses 
gridsense does not employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging  to manage its foreign currency exchange rate exposures 
fair value of financial instruments fair values of financial instruments included in current assets and current liabilities are estimated to approximate their book values due to the short maturity of such investments 
fair value for long term debt and long term deposits are estimated based on the current rates offered to us for debt and deposits with similar terms and remaining maturities 
the fair value of our long term debt and non current restricted deposits are not materially different from their book values 
concentrations of credit risk financial instruments  which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk  consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  restricted deposits  trade receivables and unbilled revenue 
the counterparty to a significant amount of our cash equivalents is a money market of a major financial institution 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by this counterparty 
the counterparty to our restricted deposits are two major israeli banks 
we do not believe there is significant risk of non performance by these counterparties 
approximately of the trade accounts receivable at december  was due from two customers that pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of trade receivables is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base 
approximately of the balance in unbilled revenue at december  was due from two customers that when billed  pay their trade receivables over usual credit periods 
credit risk with respect to the balance of unbilled revenue is generally diversified due to the number of entities comprising our customer base
