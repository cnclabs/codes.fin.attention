overview we are a leading provider of outsourcing and transformation services and focus on providing our clients with a positive business impact and enhancing their long term financial value 
we customize our services to improve the economics of business performance and transform organizations to be leaner and more flexible 
our outsourcing services provide front  middle and back office processing for our clients  who are primarily global companies 
outsourcing services involve the transfer to us of select business operations of a client  such as claims processing  policy administration and finance and accounting  after which we administer and manage the operations for our client on an ongoing basis 
we also offer a number of transformation services that include decision analytics  finance transformation and operations and process excellence services 
these transformation services help our clients provide additional insight into their future financial and operational results  improve their operating environments through cost reduction  enhanced efficiency and productivity initiatives  and enhance the risk and control environments within our clients operations whether or not they are outsourced to us 
we serve primarily the needs of global companies in the insurance and healthcare  utilities  banking and financial services  travel  transportation and logistics sectors 
on october   we acquired landacorp  a leading provider of healthcare solutions and technology the landacorp acquisition 
landacorp has more than million lives under management on its software platforms and has developed services and technology solutions that share vital clinical data with payers  providers  plan participants and accountable care organizations 
we market our services to our existing and prospective clients through our sales and client management teams  which are aligned by industry verticals and cross industry domains such as finance and accounting 
our sales and client management teams operate from the us and europe 
we operate fifteen operations centers in india  including our new operations center in pune  india and manila  philippines which began operations in we also have six operations centers in the us  two operations centers each in the philippines and bulgaria and one operations center in each of romania  malaysia and the czech republic 
revenues we generate revenues principally from contracts to provide outsourcing and transformation services 
total revenues increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  revenues from outsourcing services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues from outsourcing services of million was driven primarily by revenues of million due to the landacorp acquisition in and the acquisitions in of opi the opi acquisition and trumbull the trumbull acquisition and net volume increases from existing and new clients aggregating to million 
these increases were offset partially by a net decrease in revenues of million  primarily due to the depreciation of the indian rupee  the uk pound sterling and czech koruna against the uk dollar during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  
table of contents revenues from transformation services increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a combination of increased revenues in recurring or annuity based decision analytics services and an increase in project based engagements both in our decision analytics and operations and process excellence services 
revenues from new clients for transformation services were million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that our revenues will grow as we expand our service offerings and client base  both organically and through acquisitions 
we provide our clients with a range of outsourcing services  principally in the insurance  healthcare  utilities  banking and financial services  travel  transportation and logistics sectors  as well as cross industry outsourcing services  such as finance and accounting services 
our clients transfer the management and execution of their processes or business functions to us 
as part of this transfer  we hire and train employees to work at our operations centers on the relevant outsourcing services  implement a process migration to these operations centers and then provide services either to the client or directly to the client s customers 
each client contract has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement 
the outsourcing services we provide to any of our clients particularly under our general framework agreements  and the revenues and income that we derive from those services  may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide under those contracts change over time  including as a result of a shift in the mix of products and services we provide 
for outsourcing services  we enter into long term agreements with our clients with typical initial terms ranging from three to eight years 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
although these agreements provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base for a substantial portion of our business  the long selling cycle for our outsourcing services and the budget and approval processes of prospective clients make it difficult to predict the timing of new client acquisitions 
revenues under new client contracts also vary depending on when we complete the selling cycle and the implementation phase 
for risks relating to termination of our client contracts  see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our client contracts contain certain termination and other provisions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for risks relating to our selling cycles  see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business we have a long selling cycle for our outsourcing services that requires significant funds and management resources and a long implementation cycle that requires significant resource commitments 
through the landacorp acquisition on october   we added a leading care management software platform for healthcare payers 
as a result of our trumbull acquisition  on october   we acquired the capability to provide subrogation services as well as access to a software platform called subrosource for providing subrogation services to property and casualty insurers 
in connection with our acquisition of professional data management again pdma in april  we acquired an insurance policy administration platform called lifepro to administer life insurance  health insurance annuities and credit life and disability insurance policies for insurance and healthcare clients 
as we increase our service capabilities utilizing platform and other software based services  revenues from such services will continue to grow in proportion to our total revenues 
revenues from annual maintenance and support contracts for our software platforms provide us with a relatively predictable revenue base and are generally recognized ratably over the terms of the contracts 
new license sales and implementation projects have a long selling cycle and it is difficult to predict the timing of signing of such new contracts which may lead to fluctuations in our short term revenues 
our transformation services can be significantly affected by variations in business cycles 
in addition  our transformation services consist primarily of specific projects with contract terms generally not exceeding one to three years and may not produce ongoing or recurring business for us once the project is completed 
these contracts also usually contain provisions permitting termination of the contract after a short notice period 
the short term nature and specificity of these projects could lead to further material fluctuations and uncertainties in the revenues generated from these businesses 
we have experienced a significant increase in demand for our annuity based transformation services  which are engagements that are contracted for one to three year terms 
we serve clients mainly in the us and the us  with these two regions generating approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  
table of contents in the years ended december  and  our total revenues from our top ten clients accounted for and of our total revenues  respectively 
only one client accounted for more than of our total revenues in the year ended december  compared to two clients in the year ended december  although we are increasing and diversifying our customer base  we expect in the near future that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be contributed by a limited number of large clients 
pursuant to a services agreement  we provide services to the travelers company travelers 
these services to travelers represented million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december   and million  or  of our total revenues for the year ended december  travelers may terminate the services agreement  or any work assignment or work order thereunder all of which expire in december  without cause upon days prior notice 
we derived revenues from and new clients for our services in the years ended december  and  respectively 
another three new clients acquired during did not generate any revenues in but are expected to start generating revenues from revenues also include amounts representing reimbursable expenses that are billed to and reimbursed by our clients and typically include telecommunication and travel related costs 
the amount of reimbursable expenses that we incur  and any resulting revenues  can vary significantly depending on each client s situation and on the type of services provided 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our total revenues represent reimbursement of such expenses 
to the extent our client contracts do not contain provisions to the contrary  we bear the risk of inflation and fluctuations in currency exchange rates with respect to our contracts 
we hedge a substantial portion of our indian rupee us dollar  philippine rupee us dollar and uk pound uk dollar foreign currency exposure 
we have observed a shift in industry pricing models toward transaction based pricing and other pricing models 
we believe this trend will continue and we have begun to use transaction based and other pricing models with some of our current clients and are seeking to move certain other clients from a billing rate model to a transaction based or other pricing model 
such models place the focus on operating efficiency in order to maintain our operating margins 
in addition  we have also observed that prospective larger clients are entering into multi vendor relationships with regard to their outsourcing needs 
we believe that the trend toward multi vendor relationships will continue 
a multi vendor relationship allows a client to seek more favorable pricing and other contract terms from each vendor  which can result in significantly reduced operating margins from the provision of services to such client for each vendor 
to the extent our large clients expand their use of multi vendor relationships and are able to extract more favorable contract terms from other vendors  our operating margins and revenues may be reduced with regard to such clients if we are required to modify the terms of our relationship with such clients 
expenses cost of revenues our cost of revenues primarily consists of employee costs  which include salary  bonus and other compensation expenses  recruitment and training costs  employee insurance  transport and meals  rewards and recognition for certain employees  and non cash stock compensation expense  and costs relating to our facilities and communications network  which include telecommunication and it costs  facilities and customer management support  operational expenses for our outsourcing centers  rent expenses  and travel and other billable costs to our clients 
the most significant components of our cost of revenues are employee compensation  recruitment  training  transport  meals  rewards and recognition and employee insurance 
salary levels  employee turnover rates and our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our employees significantly affect our cost of revenues 
salary increases for most of our operations personnel are 
table of contents generally awarded each year effective april accordingly  employee costs are generally lower in the first quarter of each year compared to the rest of the year 
we make every effort to manage employee and capacity utilization and continuously monitor service levels and staffing requirements 
although we generally have been able to reallocate our employees as client demand has fluctuated  a contract termination or significant reduction in work assigned to us by a major client could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned employees  which would increase our cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues until we are able to reduce or reallocate our headcount 
a significant increase in the turnover rate among our employees  particularly among the highly skilled workforce needed to execute certain services  would increase our recruiting and training costs and decrease our operating efficiency  productivity and profit margins 
in addition  cost of revenues also includes a non cash amortization of stock compensation expense relating to our issuance of equity awards to employees directly involved in providing services to our clients 
we expect our cost of revenues to continue to increase as we continue to add professionals in our operating centers globally to service additional business and as wages continue to increase globally 
in particular  we expect training costs to continue to increase as we continue to add staff to service new clients and provide existing staff with additional skill sets 
there is significant competition for professionals with skills necessary to perform the services we offer to our clients 
as our existing competitors continue to grow  and as new competitors enter the market  we expect competition for skilled professionals in each of these areas to continue to increase  with corresponding increases in our cost of revenues to reflect increased compensation levels for such professionals 
however  a significant portion of our client contracts include inflation based adjustments to our billing rates year over year which partially offset such increase in cost of revenues 
we also expect our cost of revenues to increase due to employee turnover resulting in higher recruitment and training costs 
see item a risk factors employee wage increases may prevent us from sustaining our competitive advantage and may reduce our profit margin 
cost of revenues is also affected by our long selling cycle and implementation period for our outsourcing services  which require significant commitments of capital  resources and time by both our clients and us 
before committing to use our services  potential clients require us to expend substantial time and resources educating them as to the value of our services and assessing the feasibility of integrating our systems and processes with theirs 
in addition  once a client engages us in a new contract  our cost of revenues may represent a higher percentage of revenues until the implementation phase for that contract  generally three to four months  is completed 
selling  general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses relating to salaries of senior management and other support personnel  legal and other professional fees  telecommunications  utilities  travel and other miscellaneous administrative costs 
selling and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries and other compensation expenses of sales and marketing and client management personnel  sales commission  travel and brand building  client events and conferences 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we invest in our sales and client management functions to better serve our clients and in our branding 
we also expect our costs to increase as we continue to strengthen our support and enabling functions and invest in leadership development  performance management and training programs 
however  our sg a as a percentage of revenues has declined from in to in as a result of our acquisitions in and and operating leverage in sg a expenses also include acquisition related costs  professional fees  which represent the costs of third party legal  tax  accounting and other advisors  bad debt allowance and non cash amortization of stock compensation expense related to our issuance of equity awards to senior management  members of our board of directors  other support personnel and consultants 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization pertains to depreciation and amortization of our tangible assets  including network equipment  cabling  computers  office furniture and equipment  motor vehicles and leasehold improvements and intangible assets 
as we add new facilities and expand our existing operations centers  we expect that depreciation expense will increase  reflecting additional investments in equipment such as desktop computers  servers and other infrastructure 
amortization of intangible assets acquired is included in depreciation and 
table of contents amortization 
amortization of intangible assets has increased substantially in due to the landacorp acquisition in and the opi acquisition and the trumbull acquisition in we expect amortization of intangible assets to increase further as we pursue strategic relationships and acquisitions 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  foreign exchange exchange rates we report our financial results in us dollars 
however  a significant portion of our total revenues is earned in uk pounds sterling and  respectively  of our total revenues for the year ended december  and while a significant portion of our expenses is incurred and paid in indian rupees and  respectively  of our total costs for the years ended december  and and the philippine peso and  respectively  of our total costs for the year ended december  and 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the philippine peso  the uk pound sterling  czech koruna and the us dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
the results of our operations could be substantially impacted as the indian rupee and uk pound sterling appreciate or depreciate against the us dollar 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
currency regulation according to the prevailing foreign exchange regulations in india  an exporter of outsourcing and transformation services that is registered with a software technology park in india  such as our indian subsidiaries in india  is required to realize its export proceeds within a period of months from the date of exports 
similarly  in the event that such exporter has received any advance against exports in foreign exchange from its overseas customers  it will have to render the requisite services so that the advances so received are earned within a period of months 
if those subsidiaries in india did not meet these conditions  they would be required to obtain permission from the reserve bank of india 
income taxes the fiscal year under the indian income tax act ends on march certain of our operations centers in india qualified for an exemption from corporate tax under the indian income tax act which expired on april  therefore  profits generated from the services provided from such operations centers have become fully taxable and consequently  our tax expense increased significantly from and may continue to be higher going forward 
the special economic zones act  and rules framed thereunder the sez regulations  introduced a year tax holiday scheme for operations established in designated sezs 
under the sez regulations  qualifying operations are eligible for a profit based deduction from taxable income equal to i of the export profits derived for the first five years from the commencement of operations  ii of the export profits for the next five years  and iii subject to satisfying certain investment requirements  of the export profits for a further five years 
our operations centers in jaipur and noida  india  which were established in sezs in  are eligible for tax incentives until  ten years from the year of their establishment 
as part of the opi acquisition  we acquired operations centers in bengaluru and kochi  india that are also located in sezs 
our operations center in bengaluru completed its first five years of operations on march  and benefitted from a exemption on export profits in prior years 
under the tax regulations  the bengaluru operations center is now entitled to a tax exemption on export profits for five years beginning on april  after april   the applicable tax exemption will be further reduced 
we also established a new operations center in pune  india in june  which is located in an sez 
we anticipate establishing additional operations centers in sezs in the future 
the direct taxes code proposed by the government of india and currently pending before the indian parliament proposes grandfathering the existing profit based tax benefits for operations centers in sezs already receiving such tax benefits 
the direct taxes code also proposes discontinuing profit based incentives for 
table of contents operations centers in sezs set up after march  and replaces them with investment based incentives for operations centers in sezs established after that date 
accordingly  we expect to continue receiving the benefit of tax deductions for our existing operations centers in sezs pursuant to the current regulations until the currently proposed march  sunset date 
if this grandfathering does not happen under the direct taxes code and if the sunset date is brought forward  our new operations centers in sezs will not receive profit based tax benefits 
without such benefits  we expect that our tax rate in india and our overall tax rate will increase over the next few years and that such increase may be material 
one of our operations centers in the philippines benefited from a four year income tax holiday that expired in may in february  peza  which can approve two successive one year extensions  granted us a one year extension retroactively from may our new operations center in the philippines  which began operations in january  benefits from a separate four year income tax holiday that can be extended at peza s discretion 
while we are reasonably certain that peza will extend these tax holidays  it is possible that such extension requests may be denied  or that these tax holidays may be conditioned or removed entirely due to changes in applicable legislation by the government of the philippines 
should any of these events occur  our tax liability in the philippines would likely increase 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss carry forwards 
we determine if a valuation allowance is required or not on the basis of an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements  as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
these policies include revenue recognition  estimating tax liabilities  stock based compensation  goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets  derivative instruments and assets and obligations related to employee benefit plans 
these accounting policies and the associated risks are set out below 
future events may not develop exactly as forecast and estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenues from outsourcing and transformation services 
revenues from outsourcing services are recognized primarily on a time and material  cost plus or unit priced basis  revenues from transformation services are recognized primarily on a time and material  fixed price or contingent fee basis 
the services provided within our contracts generally contain one unit of accounting 
revenues are recognized under our contracts generally when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  services have been performed and collection of amounts billed is reasonably assured 
revenues under time and material contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
revenues are recognized on cost plus contracts on the basis of contractually agreed direct and indirect costs incurred on a client contract plus an agreed upon profit markup 
revenues are recognized on unit price based contracts based on the number of specified units of work such as the number of email responses delivered to a client 
such revenues are recognized as the related services are provided in accordance with the client contract 
when the terms of the client contract specify service level parameters that must be met such as turnaround time or accuracy  we monitor such service level parameters to determine if any service credits or penalties have been incurred 
revenues are recognized net of any service credits that are due to a client 
we have experienced minimal service credits and penalties to date 

table of contents revenues are recognized on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method when the pattern of performance under the contracts can be reasonably determined 
we estimate the proportional performance of a contract by comparing the actual number of hours or days worked to the estimated total number of hours or days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the proportional performance method requires significant judgment relative to estimating the number of hours or days required to complete the contracted scope of work  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
we regularly monitor our estimates for completion of a project and record changes in the period in which a change in an estimate is determined 
if a change in an estimate results in a projected loss on a project  such loss is recognized in the period in which it is first identified 
revenues from software licensing arrangements are recognized at the later of time of delivery or expiration of significant termination rights if the license fee is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and there is sufficient vendor specific evidence of the fair value of each undelivered element 
when there are significant production modifications or customization  installation  systems integration or related services  the professional services and license revenues are combined and recorded based upon proportional performance  measured in the manner described above 
revenues from fixed term maintenance and support contracts are recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the period of the contract 
we make accruals for revenues and receivables for services rendered between the last billing date and the balance sheet date 
accordingly  our accounts receivable include amounts for services that we have performed and for which an invoice has not yet been issued to the client 
these are included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet and the amounts are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets accounting standards codification asc topic  business combinations asc no 
 requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
the guidance specifies criteria as to intangible assets acquired in a business combination that must be recognized and reported separately from goodwill 
in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other asc no 
 all assets and liabilities of the acquired businesses including goodwill are assigned to reporting units 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or as circumstances warrant 
when determining the fair value of our reporting units  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
any adverse changes in key assumptions about our businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  we will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such asset 
the estimate of undiscounted cash flows and the fair value of assets require several assumptions and estimates like the weighted average cost of capital  discount rates  risk free rates  market rate of return and risk premiums and can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the historical assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
stock based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of asc topic  compensation stock compensation asc no 
 cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting periods 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires significant judgment  including estimating the expected term over which the stock awards will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock and the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their share based options  we have used data on the historical exercise pattern of employees 
we use the historical volatility of our common stock and the volatility of stocks of our comparative companies in order to estimate future share price trends 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option 
table of contents forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model is based on us treasury zero coupon bonds with a remaining term similar to the expected term of the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
if the actual forfeiture rate differs significantly from our estimates  our stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
derivative instruments and hedging activities in the normal course of business  we actively look to mitigate the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging arrangements  authorized under our policies  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the uk pound sterling and the indian rupee 
we also have exposure in philippine pesos  czech koruna and other local currencies where we operate 
we use derivative instruments for the purpose of mitigating the underlying exposure from foreign currency fluctuation risks associated with forecasted transactions denominated in certain foreign currencies and to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and not for speculative trading purposes 
we hedge anticipated transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure with foreign currency exchange contracts that are designated effective and that qualify as cash flow hedges under asc topic  derivatives and hedging asc no 

changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges which are deemed effective  are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges deemed ineffective are recognized in the consolidated statement of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we also use derivatives consisting of foreign currency exchange contracts not designated as hedging instruments under asc no 
to hedge intercompany balances and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are recognized in the consolidated statements of income and are included in foreign exchange gain loss 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
derivative assets and liabilities included in level primarily represent foreign currency forward contracts 
the quotes are taken primarily from independent sources  including highly rated financial institutions 
we evaluate hedge effectiveness at the time a contract is entered into as well as on an ongoing basis 
if during this time  a contract is deemed ineffective  the change in the fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of income and is included in foreign exchange gain loss 
for hedge relationships that are discontinued because the forecasted transaction is not expected to occur by the end of the originally specified period  any related derivative amounts recorded in equity are reclassified to earnings 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in respect of future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating losses carried forward  if any 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the anticipated tax rates for the years in which such temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period in which the new tax rate was enacted or the change in tax status was filed or approved 
deferred tax assets are recognized in full  subject to a valuation allowance that reduces the amount recognized to that which is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  we consider estimates of future taxable income 
with respect to any entity that benefits from a corporate tax holiday  deferred tax assets or liabilities for existing temporary differences are recorded only to the extent such temporary differences are expected to reverse following the expiration of the tax holiday 

table of contents we also evaluate potential exposures related to tax contingencies or claims made by the tax authorities in various jurisdictions in order to determine whether a reserve may be required 
a reserve is recorded if we believe that a loss is more likely than not to occur and if the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
such reserves are based on estimates and  consequently  are subject to changing facts and circumstances  including the progress of ongoing audits  changes in case law and the passage of new legislation 
we believe that we have established adequate reserves to cover any potential additional tax assessments 
we generally anticipate that we will indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly  we do not accrue any material income  distribution or withholding taxes that would otherwise arise if such earnings were repatriated in a taxable manner 
we employ a two step process for recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining  based on the technical merits  that the position will  more likely than not  be sustained upon examination 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount of the tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
our provision for income tax expense also takes into account any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
retirement benefits we provide our employees in india and the philippines with benefits under a defined benefit plan  which we refer to as the gratuity plan 
the gratuity plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees on retirement or on termination of employment in an amount based on the respective employee s salary and years of employment with us 
we determine our liability under the gratuity plan by actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method 
under this method  we determine our liability based upon the discounted value of salary increases until the date of separation arising from retirement  death  resignation or other termination of services 
critical assumptions used in measuring the plan expense and projected liability under the projected unit credit method include the discount rate  expected return on assets and the expected increase in the compensation rates 
we evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  our gratuity expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

provision for income taxes increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate increased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the increase in effective tax rate in was primarily due to a reversal in related to a tax position taken by one of our foreign subsidiaries in india 
during  the indian tax authorities issued a clarification with respect to the taxability of certain components of taxable income which reduced our foreign subsidiary s taxable income and its corresponding tax liability

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which include million held by our foreign subsidiaries 
we do not intend to repatriate such funds since our future growth depends upon continued infrastructure and technology investments  geographical expansions and acquisitions outside of the us therefore  we need to continuously and permanently reinvest the earnings generated outside of the us if we were to repatriate the funds  we would need to accrue and pay applicable taxes 
cash flows provided by operating activities increased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  generally  factors that affect our earnings including pricing  volume of services  costs and productivity affect our cash flows provided by operations in a similar manner 
however  while management of working capital  including timing of collections and payments affects operating results only indirectly  the impact on the working capital and cash flows provided by operating activities can be significant 
the increase in cash flows provided by operations for the year ended december  was predominantly due to an increase in net income adjusted for non cash items by million offset by decrease in working capital of million 
the increase in net income adjusted for non cash items is primarily due to an increase in net income of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million  deferred income taxes of million and decrease in unrealized foreign exchange gain of million 
changes in working capital are primarily due to a decrease in trade accounts receivable of million and accrued expenses and other liabilities of million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our days sales outstanding increased from days as of december  to days as of december   primarily due to our milestones based billing pertaining to our software licensing and implementation contracts associated with the landacorp acquisition 
cash flows used for investing activities decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the payment of the purchase consideration of approximately million for the landacorp acquisition in compared to million net of cash acquired of million paid for the opi acquisition and the trumbull acquisition during the year ended december  further  net proceeds from short term investments increased by million during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cash flows provided by financing activities decreased from million in the year ended december  to million during the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a public offering of million during the year ended december  this decrease was partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  we expect to use cash from operating activities to maintain and expand our business 
as we have focused on expanding our cash flow from operating activities  we continue to make capital investments  primarily related to new facilities and capital expenditures associated with leasehold improvements to build our facilities and purchase telecommunications equipment and computer hardware and software in connection with managing client operations 
we incurred approximately million and million of capital expenditures in the year ended december  and  respectively 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of between million to million in the calendar year  primarily to meet the growth requirements of our clients  including 
table of contents additions to our facilities as well as investments in technology applications and infrastructure 
the timing and volume of such capital expenditures in the future will be affected by new client contracts we may enter into or the expansion of business under our existing client contracts 
in connection with any tax assessment orders that have been issued or may be issued against us or our subsidiaries  including against exl service 
com india private limited exl india and exl service

on may   we entered into a three year credit agreement the credit facility with certain lenders and jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent 
borrowings under the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
originally a million revolving facility  including a letter of credit sub facility  the availability under the credit facility was reduced to million in june upon our request  and the fulfillment of certain conditions  the credit facility can be increased to million 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility 
we anticipate that we will continue to rely upon cash from operating activities to finance our smaller acquisitions  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
if we have significant growth through acquisitions  we may need to obtain additional financing 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements or obligations 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period less than year years years after years total in millions capital leases operating leases purchase obligations other obligations a total contractual cash obligations b a represents estimated payments under the gratuity plan 
b excludes million related to uncertain tax positions  since the extent of the amount and timing of payment is currently not reliably estimable or determinable 
certain units of our indian subsidiaries were established as export oriented units under the software technology parks of india stpi scheme promulgated by the government of india which provides certain incentives on imported and indigenous capital goods upon the fulfillment of certain conditions 
although the corporate tax incentives under the stpi scheme are no longer available to us  the units are required to fulfill such conditions for a limited time 
in the event that these units are unable to meet those conditions over the specified period  we may be required to refund those incentives along with penalties and fines 
we believe  however  that these units have in the past satisfied and will continue to satisfy the required conditions 
our operations centers in manila  the philippines are registered with peza 
the registration provides us with certain fiscal incentives on the import of capital goods and requires that exl philippines meet certain performance and investment criteria 
one of our operations centers in the philippines benefited from a four year income tax holiday that expired in may in february  we received a one year extension retroactively from may and expect to file another extension request after which no further extensions are presently permitted 
our new operations center in the philippines  which began operations in january  benefits from a separate four year income tax holiday that can be extended at peza s discretion

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the loss of future earnings  fair values or future cash flows that may result from a change in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
market risk is attributable to all market sensitive financial instruments including foreign currency receivables and payables 
our exposure to market risk is a function of our expenses and revenue generating activities in foreign currencies 
the objective of market risk management is to avoid excessive exposure of our earnings and equity to loss 
we manage market risk through our treasury operations 
our senior management and our board of directors approve our treasury operations objectives and policies 
the activities of our treasury operations include management of cash resources  implementing hedging strategies for foreign currency exposures  borrowing strategies  if any  and ensuring compliance with market risk limits and policies 
components of market risk foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk arises principally from exchange rate risk 
although substantially all of our revenues are denominated in us dollars in the year ended december  or uk pounds sterling in the year ended december   a substantial portion of our expenses were incurred and paid in indian rupees and philippine pesos and  respectively  in the year ended december  
we also incur expenses in us dollars  the czech koruna and the currencies of the other countries in which we have operations 
the exchange rates among the indian rupee  the philippine peso  uk pound sterling  czech koruna and the uk dollar have changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future 
our exchange rate risk primarily arises from our foreign currency revenues  expenses incurred by our foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency accounts receivable and payable 
based upon our level of operations during the year ended december  and excluding any hedging arrangements that we had in place during that period  a appreciation depreciation in the indian rupee against the us dollar would have increased decreased our revenues in the year ended december  by approximately million and our expenses incurred and paid in indian rupees by approximately million 
we have sought to reduce the effect of indian rupee and philippine peso and certain other local currency exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results by purchasing forward foreign exchange contracts to cover a substantial portion of our expected cash flows 
further  a significant number of our customer contracts include protection against foreign exchange rate fluctuations which minimizes the impact of volatility in the exchange rates on our operating results 
forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of million were outstanding at december  compared to million outstanding at december  at december   the cash flow hedging derivatives had maturity periods of one to thirty three months 
these contracts must be settled on the day of maturity or may be cancelled subject to the payment of any gains or losses in the difference between the contract exchange rate and the market exchange rate on the date of cancellation 
we use these instruments as cash flow hedges and not for speculative purposes 
we may not purchase contracts adequate to insulate ourselves from indian rupee and philippine pesos foreign exchange currency risks 
in addition  any such contracts may not perform adequately as a hedging mechanism 
we may  in the future  adopt more active hedging policies  and have done so in the past 

table of contents we hedge our net recognized foreign currency assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these derivative instruments hedge assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies and are carried at fair value with changes in the fair value recorded as foreign exchange gain loss 
these derivative instruments do not subject us to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on the settlement of these derivatives are intended to offset revaluation losses and gains on the assets and liabilities being hedged 
forward exchange contracts with notional amounts of million and gbp million were outstanding at december  compared to million and gbp million outstanding at december  at december   the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of days or less 
interest rate risk 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  these amounts were invested principally in a short term investment portfolio primarily comprised of highly rated mutual funds  money market accounts and time deposits 
the cash and cash equivalents are held for potential acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
we believe that we have no material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
the interest income from these funds will be subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates would reduce future investment income 
a basis points change in short term rates would impact our interest income for the year ended december  by approximately million 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings under the credit facility 
credit risk 
as of december   we had accounts receivable of million 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations
