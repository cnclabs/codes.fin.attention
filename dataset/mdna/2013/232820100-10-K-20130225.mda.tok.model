item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
it is assumed that the reader is familiar with the description of our business and risk factors contained in part i of this report 
currency amounts are in millions  except per share amounts 
percentages are approximate 
general we are a global specialty materials and chemicals company focused on developing  manufacturing and selling value added products 
our products serve a diverse range of end markets including aerospace and industrial materials  mining and plastics 
sales price and volume by region and the impact of exchange rates on our reporting segments are important measures that are analyzed by management and are provided in our segment analysis 
we report net sales in four geographic regions north america  latin america  asia pacific and europe middle east africa 
the destination of the sale determines the region under which it is reported consistent with management s view of the business 
north america consists of the united states and canada 
latin america includes mexico  central america  south america and the caribbean islands 
asia pacific is comprised of asia  australia and the islands of the south pacific rim 
selling price changes and raw material cost changes year on year are an important factor in profitability especially in years of high volatility 
discussion of the year to year impact of raw materials and energy is provided in our segment discussion 
in addition  higher global demand levels and  occasionally  operating difficulties at suppliers  have limited the availability of certain of our raw materials 
acquisitions umeco plc on july   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of umeco plc umeco  an international provider of composite and process materials  in an all cash transaction at a cost of approximately to fund the transaction  we used approximately from the draw down of our existing revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with the balance funded by cash on hand 
the acquisition is intended to strengthen our position as a leading manufacturer of composite materials  while offering significant opportunities for growth and value creation  particularly in industrial composites and process materials 
the acquired umeco business is being reported as a separate segment 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
star orechem international private limited on march   we acquired the manufacturing assets of star orechem international private limited soil  in nagpur  central india  in a cash transaction 
the acquisition is expected to increase our global capacity for our metal extraction product line of our in process separation segment by approximately  and provides the ability to further expand production at the site

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details 
discontinued operations coating resins the results of operations of the former coating resins segment are reported as discontinued operations  and are therefore excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 
the results of the psa product line are included in discontinued operations up through its sale on july  all previously reported financial information has been revised to conform to the current presentation 
on july   we completed the sale of the psa product line of the coating resins segment to henkel ag co 
henkel for approximately  including working capital of approximately  subject to post closing working capital adjustments 
in august  we received cash consideration of from the sale 
we recorded an after tax gain on the sale of in  which is included in net loss gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax in the consolidated statements of income 
on october   we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our remaining coating resins business to advent international  a global private equity firm for  plus assumed liabilities of bringing the total value to  the sale 
table of contents is expected to close in the first quarter of  following the satisfaction of regulatory requirements and other customary closing conditions 
as a result  we recorded cumulative after tax charges of in to adjust our carrying value of the disposal group to its fair value less cost to sell  based on the terms of the definitive agreement 
the charge is included in net loss gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax in the consolidated statements of income 
building block chemicals on february   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our building block chemicals business the business to cornerstone chemical company  an affiliate of hig capital  llc the purchaser  pursuant to an asset purchase agreement the agreement dated january   between the company and the purchaser 
the total consideration received from the sale was  including cash consideration of that we received at closing and a promissory note for a cash payment of was made to the purchaser in july as final settlement of the agreed upon working capital transferred  resulting in net realized consideration of accordingly  the business was treated as discontinued operations and excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented 
segment realignment we regularly review our segment reporting and classifications and may periodically change our reportable segments to align with strategic and operational changes 
in the first quarter of  we announced that we had retained an advisor to help us explore the potential separation of our coating resins segment  along with the psa product line and certain methyl acrylamide nma product groups 
in light of this potential separation  we realigned our segment reporting internal and external and management structure accordingly 
psa and nma  which previously were included in our engineered materials and additive technologies segments  respectively  became a part of the coating resins segment 
concurrently  to align the segments with our revised management structure and operating model  we moved the formulated resins business out of the engineered materials segment into the additive technologies segment 
as noted above  in october we signed an agreement for the sale of the coating resins business to advent international 
as discussed above  the former coating resins and building block chemicals segments are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented  and the acquired umeco business is reported as a separate segment and includes results of operations since we acquired it on july  in  we plan to report separately the aerospace and industrial materials from the engineered materials and umeco segments into two new segments  aerospace materials and industrial materials 
they will be managed and reported separately to properly align our resources  assets  and strategy with target end markets 
manufacturing assets and processes are similar although supply chains are dissimilar 
we believe this is a more appropriate way to reflect how we anticipate managing the business going forward  and follows our strategy of focusing on aerospace and industrial markets separately 
the new segment reporting is expected to be in effect the first quarter of and we believe is more transparent and understandable to investors

these business tax incentives retroactively reinstated and extended through  include  but are not limited to  the research and development credit as well as the favorable look through treatment of payments between related controlled foreign corporations 
although this legislation reinstated these favorable tax laws retroactive to january   accounting rules require that the tax impact of such changes  which we estimate to be  be reflected in the period the law is enacted 
we also expect there to be a change to the liability recorded with respect to the unremitted earnings that are anticipated to be repatriated subsequent to the coating resins divestiture related not only to this tax law change but also related to the expected divestiture in net earnings from continuing operations for was per diluted share  an increase of from per diluted share reported for the same period in included in continuing operations for were after tax restructuring charges of per diluted share across corporate functions to mitigate continuing costs

from time to time  based on such factors as local tax regulations  prevailing interest rates and our plans for capital investment or other investments  it may make economic sense to utilize our existing credit lines in order to meet our cash requirements  which may include debt service related disbursements 
we are required to meet financial ratios under our five year revolving credit agreement  including a maximum permitted ratio of total consolidated debt as defined to consolidated ebitda as defined and a minimum consolidated ebitda as defined to interest expense ratio 
complying with these ratios could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities 
our ability to comply with the covenants will depend on our future operating performance 
if we fail to comply with those covenants and terms  we will be in default 
in this case  we would be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance 
if we were unable to obtain any necessary waivers  the amounts outstanding under this agreement could be accelerated  and become immediately due and payable  and we would not be able to borrow any additional funds under the agreement while such default continued 
we are in compliance with these covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future 
we have of borrowings outstanding under the agreement as of december  our ability to fully utilize our revolving credit agreement can be limited by our actual calculated debt covenant ratio as compared to the maximum debt covenant ratio permitted under the agreement 
at december   of the facility is available to us  and we expect that the full amount will continue to be available based on our current forecasts 
use of cash we have generated a significant amount of cash in recent years 
going into  our use of cash priority will be to invest in the typical maintenance of business capital spending projects and pension contributions 
this is followed by expansion cost reduction capital in our growth product lines and fast payback margin improvement capital in our cash product lines 
in addition  if available at a reasonable price  we will pursue bolt on acquisitions for our growth product lines 
we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases 
we have approximately of buyback authorized as of december  our expectation is to complete the buyback with proceeds received from the anticipated sale of coating resins 
we have not guaranteed any indebtedness of our unconsolidated associated company 
inflation at this time is not considered significant although higher costs for energy and commodities could impact our future operating expenses and capital spending 
the impact of increasing raw material costs is discussed earlier in item  business customers and suppliers 
we estimate that pension and postretirement plan funding will be approximately in compared to in approximately of the funding is expected to be provided by proceeds from the anticipated sale of coating resins

refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  as well as note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we had of outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds and bank guarantees at december  that are issued on our behalf in the ordinary course of business to support certain of our performance obligations and commitments 
the instruments are typically renewed on an annual basis 
we do not have any unconsolidated limited purpose entities or any undisclosed material transactions or commitments involving related persons or entities 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
currencies are in millions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in currency rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  we may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with our established policies 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
currency risk we periodically enter into currency forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the respective entity 
at december   the principal transactions hedged involved accounts receivable and accounts payable 
when hedging currency exposures  our practice is to hedge such exposures with forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net notional amounts of forward contracts outstanding translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows december  buy sell us dollar euro canadian dollar australian dollar thai baht chilean peso mexican peso malaysian ringgit colombian peso pound sterling norwegian krone us dollar euro pound sterling chinese yuan brazilian real japanese yen the net favorable fair value of currency contracts  based on exchange rates at december   was assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would decrease by approximately however  since these contracts hedge specific transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
interest rate risk at december   our outstanding borrowings consisted of of short term variable rate borrowings  of long term floating rate debt  and of long term fixed rate debt 
our total long term debt had a carrying value of  a face value of  and a fair value of the fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which incorporates the contractual terms of the notes and observable market based inputs that include time value  interest rate curves  and credit spreads 
assuming other factors are held constant  a hypothetical increase decrease of in the weighted average prevailing interest rate on our variable rate debt outstanding as of december   interest expense would increase decrease by approximately for the next fiscal year and the fair value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease increase by approximately significant accounting estimates critical accounting policies accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents share based compensation us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires recognition of compensation cost in an amount equal to the fair value of share based payments 
compensation cost for performance stock is recorded based on the market value on the original date of grant which is the fair value 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in cash cash settled sars is recognized based on the fair value of the award at the end of each period through the date of settlement 
compensation cost for stock appreciation rights payable in shares stock settled sars and stock options is recognized over the vesting period based on the estimated fair value on the date of the grant 
gaap also requires that we estimate a forfeiture rate for all share based awards 
we monitor share option exercise and employee termination patterns to estimate forfeiture rates within the valuation model 
the estimated fair values are based on assumptions  including estimated lives of the instruments  historical and implied volatility  dividend yield on our common stock  and risk free interest rates 
we also consider the probability that the options and stock settled sars will be exercised prior to the end of their contractual lives and the probability of termination or retirement of the holder 
these assumptions are based on reasonable facts but are subject to change based on a variety of external factors 
changes in assumptions from period to period may materially affect the amount of share based compensation cost we recognize in income 
environmental and other contingent liabilities accruals for environmental remediation and operating and maintenance costs directly related to remediation and other contingent liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
accruals are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected liabilities  without any discount to reflect the time value of money 
these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
the amount accrued for environmental remediation reflects our assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature and cost of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
included in other contingent liabilities are workers compensation  product liability and toxic tort claims 
the amount accrued for other contingent liabilities reflects our assumptions about the incidence  severity  indemnity costs and dismissal rates for existing and future claims 
our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables are based on a study which is prepared every three years by a third party 
during the third quarter of  we completed an actuarial study of our asbestos related contingent liabilities and related insurance receivables  which updated our last study prepared in the third quarter of the study is based on  among other things  the incidence and nature of historical claims data through june   the incidence of malignancy claims  the severity of indemnity payments for malignancy and non malignancy claims  dismissal rates by claim type  estimated future claim frequency  settlement values and reserves  and expected average insurance recovery rates by claim type 
as a result of the findings  we recorded a decrease of to our self insured and insured contingent liabilities for indemnity costs for pending and anticipated probable future claims and recorded a decrease of related to receivables for probable insurance recoveries for these pending and future claims 
the reserve decrease is attributable to significantly lower projected claim filings offset by more severe malignancy rates and settlement value projections 
the decrease in the receivable is a result of the lower gross liability and a shift in the types of future claims expected 
overall  we expect to recover approximately of our future indemnity costs 
we have completed coverage in place agreements with most of our larger insurance carriers 
although these estimates and assumptions are based on reasonable facts  they are subject to change based on the actual outcome and a variety of external factors 
a sustained change in the annual number of future asbestos claims filed against us will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
a sustained change in the average value of asbestos claims paid will increase or decrease the liability and related receivable by and  respectively 
accruals for environmental remediation and other contingent liabilities can change substantially if our assumptions are not realized or due to actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
we cannot estimate any additional amount of loss or range of loss in excess of the recorded amounts 
moreover  environmental and other contingent liabilities are paid over an extended period  and the timing of such payments cannot be predicted with any certainty 
accruals for environmental and other 
table of contents contingent liabilities are recorded as other noncurrent liabilities with any amounts expected to be paid out in the next twelve months classified as accrued expenses 
probable insurance recoveries for past and probable future indemnity costs are recorded at management s best estimate of the ultimate expected receipts without discounting to reflect the time value of money and are recorded as other assets 
a number of factors impact the estimates of insurance reimbursements 
these factors include the financial viability of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies  how legal and defense costs will be covered by the insurance policies  the interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships  and historical recovery rates over the past ten years 
defense and processing costs are expensed as incurred 
insurance recoveries for defense and processing costs are recognized when the recovery is probable and related costs are incurred and are recorded as other assets 
retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
our most significant pension plans are in the us  and constituted over of our consolidated pension assets and of projected benefit obligations as of december  the calculation of our pension expense and pension liability associated with our defined benefit pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different pension expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
we believe that the most critical assumptions are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rates 
our us salaried pension plan was frozen on december  at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used for pension liabilities 
in estimating this rate  we look at the yields on high quality  long term corporate bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
future expected actuarially determined cash flows of our major us plans are matched against a yield curve encompassing such bonds to arrive at a single discount rate by plan 
we discounted our us future pension and postretirement medical liabilities using a rate of and  respectively  at december  the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on expense 
a increase to the discount rate for our us pension plans would decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our pension plans would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by a increase to the discount rate for our us postretirement medical plan would decrease our expected annual expense by and decrease our liability by a decrease to the discount rate for our us postretirement medical plan would increase our expected annual expense by and increase our liability by in order to reduce the volatility of our pension plan assets relative to pension liabilities  we have gradually implemented a liability driven investment ldi strategy for our us  us and canadian defined benefit pension plans 
as part of the strategy  we have transitioned some of our equity allocation to longer term fixed income assets with an emphasis on high quality corporate bonds 
as the funded status of the plans improves  we expect to further decrease equity investments and increase fixed income investments 
as a result of these changes  the expected rates of return have been adjusted downward  as appropriate  to reflect the new allocations 
the expected rate of return on our us plan assets  which was for  reflects the long term average rate of return expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
we establish the expected rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to us at that time  including the historical returns of major asset classes  the expected investment mix of the plans assets  and estimates of future long term investment returns 
a change to the expected rate of return on plan assets of our us pension plans would increase or decrease our expected pension expense by  the expected postretirement medical expense would increase or decrease by the pension plans investment mix at december  approximated equities and fixed income securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss is amortized into pension expense in accordance with gaap 
the assumed rate of future increases in the per capita cost of healthcare benefits healthcare cost trend rate is in  decreasing to ultimate trend of in the healthcare cost trend 
table of contents rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation apbo and related expense 
a decrease to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would decrease our expense by and decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by a increase to the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for our postretirement benefit plans would increase our expense by and increase our postretirement benefit obligation by as a result of the use of our ldi strategy and the increase in the funded levels of our pension plans  we are in the process of reviewing our pension and postretirement benefit accounting policies to determine if mark to market accounting would be a preferred method 
under mark to market accounting actuarial gains and losses would be recognized on the income statement in the year incurred rather than amortizing them over future periods 
a mark to market adjustment would be made in the fourth quarter of each year reflecting that year s actuarial gains or losses 
these gains or losses result from changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions  actual returns on plan assets versus expectations  and other differences between actual experience and assumptions 
certain components of expense would be charged at the business segment level  while others  including the annual mark to market adjustments  would be charged to corporate and unallocated 
we have engaged our actuaries to assist in this process 
if we do decide that this change is appropriate  we would apply this change to our continuing pension and postretirement plans on a retrospective basis and restate prior periods accordingly 
the impact of this change to our earnings in any period could be material 
we expect to reach a decision by the end of the first quarter of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we have defined our segments as our reporting units 
our four business segments are engineered materials  umeco  in process separation  and additive technologies 
engineered materials and umeco serve principally aerospace and industrial markets 
in process separation and additive technologies serve large  global industrial markets 
the segments above reflect how we run our company  manage the assets  and view our customers 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
goodwill of a reporting unit will be tested for impairment between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
for our goodwill impairment test  we applied the provision of accounting standards update asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other  that allows us to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not ie greater than probability that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of the facts and circumstances  we determine it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
if we determined otherwise  we would be required to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
for our qualitative assessment of the reporting unit  we considered all relevant facts and circumstances  including the excess fair value from the most recent fair value calculation  circumstances that could cause significant changes to the most recent carrying value calculation  the overall financial performance of the reporting unit compared to previous projections  the estimated financial performance projected in the near and long term  such as ebitda and cash flows  industry and market conditions  including overall market multiple metrics  competitive environment and demand for our products  overall macroeconomic conditions including our ability to access capital  and changes in management  key personnel or strategy for the reporting unit 
more weight was placed on events or circumstances that most affect a reporting unit s fair value or carrying amount of its net assets 
as a result of this qualitative assessment  we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values  and performing the two step impairment test was not required 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we are not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be 
table of contents charged to earnings 
intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed long lived assets  including those to be disposed  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets or asset group to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets and would be charged to earnings 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less the costs to sell 
depreciation effective january   we changed our method of depreciation for the majority of our north american fixed assets from straight line composite depreciation to straight line by individual asset 
historically  we had used the composite depreciation method for the plants  equipment and facilities at the majority of our north american facilities 
under this method  all similar assets across these locations were combined into common pools and depreciated under composite depreciation rates 
recent business divestitures and sales of assets had significantly reduced our composite asset base  and during  we performed a full physical inventory of fixed assets at our composite locations 
as part of this analysis  where appropriate  we made changes to certain asset records in our fixed assets system effective january  to segregate individual assets that had been installed together and had previously been combined into one item 
we also reviewed the estimated useful lives of our assets at this more specific level 
we believe that the straight line depreciation method for individual assets is preferable to the composite method because it is a more precise method of allocating historical cost and results in a consistent depreciation policy for all of our locations 
as a result  the useful lives of our assets are now generally estimated to range from to years for equipment and from to years for buildings 
this change in the method of depreciation is considered a change in accounting estimate inseparable from a change in accounting principle  and resulted in changes to our depreciation expense prospectively from the effective date 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to current operating expenses 
acquisitions  additions and betterments  either to provide necessary capacity  improve the efficiency of production units  modernize or replace older facilities or to install equipment for protection of the environment  are capitalized 
we capitalize interest costs incurred during the period of construction of plants and equipment 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
we intend to primarily reinvest the unremitted earnings of those international subsidiaries that are independent of the coating resins divestiture 
accounting rules require establishing a tax liability on the unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries if it is management s intention to no longer permanently reinvest such earnings 
as a result of the intended sale of coatings resins  management s intentions changed with regard to a portion of the unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  included in income tax expense is of tax expense incurred due to the repatriation of certain earnings during and an estimated to be incurred on the future repatriation of other earnings  subsequent to the sale of coating resins 
with the exception of the unremitted earnings of those international subsidiaries that are related to the coating resins divestiture  no provision has been made for us or additional non us taxes with respect to these earnings 
in the event of repatriation to the us  such earnings would be subject to us income taxes in most cases 
foreign tax credits would be available to substantially reduce the amount of us tax otherwise payable in future years 
our annual effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning 
table of contents opportunities available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining the annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions 
we establish accruals for tax contingencies when  notwithstanding the reasonable belief that our tax return positions are fully supported  we believe that certain filing positions are likely to be challenged and moreover  that such filing positions may not be fully sustained 
we recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
we continually evaluate our uncertain tax positions and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances including but not limited to emerging case law  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of a given tax contingency could impact the income tax provision in the period of resolution 
our accruals for gross uncertain tax positions are presented in the balance sheet within income taxes payable and other noncurrent liabilities 
derivative financial instruments and certain hedging activities we use derivative instruments in accordance with our established policies to manage exposure to fluctuations in currency rates  interest rates and  when appropriate  natural gas prices in north america 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we enter into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and make reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit related and performance related risks 
foreign currency risk we use currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps to manage our exposure to fluctuations in currency rates on third party and intercompany transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
we hedge such exposures with currency forward contracts and cross currency swaps denominated in the same currency and with similar terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item or transaction 
all derivative contracts used to manage foreign currency risk are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in fair value are reported in earnings or deferred  depending on the nature and effectiveness of the hedging relationship 
ineffectiveness  if any  in a hedging relationship is recognized immediately into earnings 
if the hedging relationship is not highly effective in generating offsetting cash flows or changes in fair value  we would recognize the change in the fair value of the currency forward contract in other income expense  net 
there was no ineffectiveness in   or fair value measurements we have certain assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements  for which we determine the appropriate level in the fair value input hierarchy for each fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  interest rates  exchange rates  and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
derivatives all of our derivatives are valued based on level inputs 
our currency forwards are valued based on readily available published indices for currency exchange rates 
pension the fair values of our level pension assets are determined based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets 
the fair values of our level pension assets are based on the net asset values of the funds  which are based on quoted market prices of the underlying investments 
our level assets include an insurance contract and a real estate fund 
the fair value of the insurance contract held by one of our non us plans is based on the contractual terms of the arrangement with the insurance company 
the fair value of the real estate fund is based on the net asset value of shares held at year end
