item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses our results of operations and our financial condition 
md a should be read in conjunction with our items business  a risk factors  and properties and our consolidated financial statements in item below 
executive overview our results in fiscal were significantly affected by colder heating season and spring weather and the full year operations of heritage propane which we acquired in january although temperatures based upon heating degree days averaged slightly warmer than normal in fiscal  temperatures were significantly colder than the record setting warm temperatures experienced in fiscal which significantly increased our retail volumes sold 
net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal was million compared with net income attributable to amerigas partners for fiscal of million 
results in fiscal benefited from the full year operations of heritage propane which was acquired by the partnership on january  see note to consolidated financial statements for further information 
notwithstanding average temperatures that were approximately warmer than normal in fiscal  temperatures were approximately colder than the prior year 
results for fiscal include million of transition costs associated with heritage propane while fiscal includes million of transition and acquisition costs associated with heritage propane 
fiscal results also include a million loss on extinguishments of debt 
looking ahead  our results in fiscal will be influenced by a number of factors including  among others  temperatures in our service territories during the peak heating season  the level and volatility of commodity prices for propane  the strength of economic activity and customer conservation 
during fiscal  we completed the integration of heritage propane and we expect to reap the full year benefits of the integration in fiscal analysis of results of operations the following analyses compare the partnership s results of operations for fiscal with fiscal and fiscal with the year ended september  fiscal

based on existing cash balances  cash expected to be generated from operations  and borrowings available under the credit agreement  the partnership s management believes that the partnership will be able to meet its anticipated contractual commitments and projected cash needs during fiscal for a more detailed discussion of the credit agreement  see note to consolidated financial statements 
partnership distributions the partnership makes distributions to its partners approximately days after the end of each fiscal quarter in a total amount equal to its available cash as defined in the fourth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership  as amended  the partnership agreement for such quarter 
available cash generally means cash on hand at the end of such quarter  plus all additional cash on hand as of the date of determination resulting from borrowings after the end of such quarter  less the amount of cash reserves established by the general partner in its reasonable discretion 
the general partner may establish reserves for the proper conduct of the partnership s business and for distributions during the next four quarters 
distributions of available cash are made to limited partners and to the general partner giving effect to the interest of the general partner in distributions of available cash from amerigas olp to amerigas partners until available cash exceeds the minimum quarterly distribution of and the first target distribution of per common unit or a total of per common unit 
when available cash exceeds per common unit in any quarter  the general partner will receive a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution but only with respect to the amount by which the distribution per common unit to limited partners exceeds 
quarterly distributions of available cash per limited partner unit paid during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were as follows fiscal st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter 
table of contents during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the partnership made quarterly distributions to common unitholders in excess of per limited partner unit 
as a result  the general partner received a greater percentage of the total partnership distribution than its aggregate general partner interest in amerigas olp and amerigas partners 
the total amount of distributions received by the general partner with respect to its aggregate general partner ownership interests totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in these amounts are incentive distributions received by the general partner during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal of million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows operating activities 
due to the seasonal nature of the partnership s business  cash flows from operating activities are generally greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for propane consumed during the heating season months 
conversely  operating cash flows are generally at their lowest levels during the first and fourth fiscal quarters when the partnership s investment in working capital  principally accounts receivable and inventories  is generally greatest 
the partnership may use its credit agreements to satisfy its seasonal operating cash flow needs 
cash flow from operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by used to fund changes in operating working capital totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow from changes in operating working capital primarily reflects the impact of propane prices on cash receipts from customers as reflected in changes in accounts receivable and cash paid for propane purchased as reflected in changes in inventories and accounts payable 
the greater cash flow from operating activities before changes in operating working capital in fiscal largely reflects the full year effects of the operations of heritage propane and the improved operating results 
the greater cash provided by changes in working capital in fiscal largely reflects the timing of the acquisition of heritage propane on cash receipts from heritage propane customers and the effects of lower volumes sold on changes in accounts receivable from our legacy operations 
investing activities 
investing activity cash flow principally comprises expenditures for property  plant and equipment  cash paid for acquisitions of businesses and proceeds from sales of assets 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in fiscal   million in fiscal and million in fiscal fiscal cash flow used in investing activities reflects cash used for the acquisition of heritage propane 
we spent million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures  million of capital expenditures associated with heritage propane integration activities and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures  million of capital expenditures associated with heritage propane integration activities and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal  and million for property  plant and equipment comprising million of maintenance capital expenditures and million of growth capital expenditures in fiscal cash paid for acquisitions in fiscal principally reflects the january acquisition of heritage propane 
financing activities 
financing activity cash flow principally comprises distributions on amerigas partners common units  issuances and repayments of long term debt  bank loan borrowings  and issuances of amerigas partners common units 
cash flow provided used by financing activities was million in fiscal   million in fiscal and million in fiscal the greater distributions in fiscal primarily reflects the higher quarterly per unit distribution rates and the full year impact of a greater number of common units outstanding 
the greater distributions in fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a greater number of common units outstanding  due to the acquisition of heritage propane and the public common unit offering  and higher quarterly per unit distribution rates in fiscal in order to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of heritage propane  on january   amerigas partners issued million principal amount of the notes due and billion principal amount of notes due during march  amerigas partners sold million common units in an underwritten public offering and used a portion of the net proceeds to repay million of outstanding senior notes due  to reduce bank loan borrowings and for general corporate purposes 
during june  amerigas partners repurchased an additional million of its notes 
capital expenditures in the following table  we present capital expenditures which exclude acquisitions for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we also provide amounts we expect to spend in fiscal we expect to finance fiscal capital expenditures principally from cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 

table of contents year ended september  millions of dollars estimate property  plant and equipment a a fiscal and capital expenditures include million and million  respectively  of transition capital expenditures relating to heritage propane integration activities 
contractual cash obligations and commitments the partnership has certain contractual cash obligations that extend beyond fiscal including scheduled repayments of long term debt  interest on long term fixed rate debt  lease obligations  capital expenditures and propane supply contracts 
the following table presents significant contractual cash obligations as of september  payments due by period millions of dollars total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and thereafter long term debt a interest on long term fixed rate debt b operating leases propane supply contracts other purchase obligations c total a based upon stated maturity dates 
b based upon stated interest rates 
c includes material capital expenditure obligations 
the components of other noncurrent liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet at september   principally consist of property and casualty liabilities and  to a much lesser extent  liabilities associated with executive compensation plans and employee post employment benefit programs 
these liabilities are not included in the table of contractual cash obligations and commitments because they are estimates of future payments and not contractually fixed as to timing or amount 
certain of our operating lease arrangements  primarily vehicle leases with remaining lease terms of one to ten years  have residual value guarantees 
although such fair values at the end of the leases have historically exceeded the guaranteed amount  at september   the maximum potential amount of future payments under lease guarantees  assuming the leased equipment was deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  was approximately million 
related party transactions pursuant to the partnership agreement  the general partner is entitled to reimbursement for all direct and indirect expenses incurred or payments it makes on behalf of the partnership 
these costs  which totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal  include employee compensation and benefit expenses of employees of the general partner and general and administrative expenses 
ugi provides certain financial and administrative services to the general partner 
ugi bills the general partner monthly for all direct and indirect corporate expenses incurred in connection with providing these services and the general partner is reimbursed by the partnership for these expenses 
the allocation of indirect ugi corporate expenses to the partnership utilizes a weighted  three component formula based on the relative percentage of the partnership s revenues  operating expenses and net assets employed to the total of such items for all ugi operating subsidiaries for which general and administrative services are provided 
the general partner believes that this allocation method is reasonable and equitable to the partnership 
such corporate expenses totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  ugi and certain of its subsidiaries provide office space  stop loss medical coverage and automobile liability insurance to the partnership 
the costs related to these items totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal from time to time  amerigas olp purchases propane on an as needed basis from ugi energy services  inc energy services 
the price of the purchases are generally based on market price at the time of purchase

market risk disclosures our primary financial market risks include commodity prices for propane and interest rates on borrowings 
although we use derivative financial and commodity instruments to reduce market price risk associated with forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative financial and commodity instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
commodity price risk the risk associated with fluctuations in the prices the partnership pays for propane is principally a result of market forces reflecting changes in supply and demand for propane and other energy commodities 
the partnership s profitability is sensitive to changes in propane supply costs and the partnership generally passes on increases in such costs to customers 
the partnership may not  however  always be able to pass through product cost increases fully or on a timely basis  particularly when product costs rise rapidly 
in order to reduce the volatility of the partnership s propane market price risk  we use contracts for the forward purchase or sale of propane  propane fixed price supply agreements  and over the counter derivative commodity instruments including price swap and option contracts 
over the counter derivative commodity instruments utilized by the partnership to hedge forecasted purchases of propane are generally settled at expiration of the contract 
these derivative financial instruments contain collateral provisions 
the fair value of unsettled commodity price risk sensitive instruments at september  and  were gains losses of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in the market price of propane would result in a decrease in such fair values of million and million  respectively 
because the partnership s propane derivative instruments generally qualify as hedges under gaap  we expect that changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to manage propane market price risk would be substantially offset by gains or losses on the associated anticipated transactions 
interest rate risk the partnership has both fixed rate and variable rate debt 
changes in interest rates impact the cash flows of variable rate debt but generally do not impact their fair value 
conversely  changes in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed rate debt but do not impact their cash flows 
our variable rate debt includes borrowings under the credit agreement 
this agreement has interest rates that are generally indexed to short term market interest rates 
at september  and  there were million and million  respectively  of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement 
based upon the average level of borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement during fiscal and  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased annual interest expense by approximately million for each year 
the remainder of our debt outstanding is subject to fixed rates of interest 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in decreases in the fair value of this fixed rate debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in increases in the fair market value of this debt of million and million at september  and  respectively 
our long term debt is typically issued at fixed rates of interest based upon market rates for debt having similar terms and credit ratings 
as these long term debt issues mature  we may refinance such debt with new debt having interest rates reflecting then current market conditions 
this debt may have an interest rate that is more or less than the refinanced debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with forecasted issuances of fixed rate debt  from time to time  we may enter into interest rate protection agreements 
there were no settled or unsettled amounts relating to interest rate protection agreements at september  or 
table of contents derivative financial instruments credit risk the partnership is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial and commodity instruments 
our counterparties principally consist of major energy companies and major us financial institutions 
we maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk 
these policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties financial condition  including their credit ratings  and entering into agreements with counterparties that govern credit limits 
certain of these agreements call for the posting of collateral by the counterparty or by the partnership in the form of letters of credit  parental guarantees or cash 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies and estimates discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
changes in these policies and estimates could have a material effect on the financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies and estimates necessarily requires management s most subjective or complex judgments regarding estimates and projected outcomes of future events which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions associated with them  with the general partner s audit committee 
in addition  management has reviewed the following disclosures regarding the application of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee 
also  see note to consolidated financial statements which discusses the significant accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives 
litigation accruals and environmental liabilities 
the partnership is involved in litigation regarding pending claims and legal actions that arise in the normal course of its business and may own sites at which hazardous substances may be present 
in accordance with gaap  the partnership establishes reserves for pending claims and legal actions or environmental remediation liabilities when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount or range of amounts can be reasonably estimated 
reasonable estimates involve management judgments based on a broad range of information and prior experience 
these judgments are reviewed quarterly as more information is received and the amounts reserved are updated as necessary 
such estimated reserves may differ materially from the actual liability and such reserves may change materially as more information becomes available and estimated reserves are adjusted 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets 
we compute depreciation on property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives generally ranging from to years 
we also use amortization methods and determine asset values of intangible assets subject to amortization using reasonable assumptions and projections 
changes in the estimated useful lives of property  plant and equipment and changes in intangible asset amortization methods or values could have a material effect on our results of operations 
as of september   our net property  plant and equipment totaled  million and we recorded depreciation expense of million during fiscal as of september   our net intangible assets subject to amortization totaled million and we recorded amortization expense on intangible assets subject to amortization of million during fiscal purchase price allocations 
from time to time  we enter into material business combinations 
in accordance with accounting guidance associated with business combinations  the purchase price is allocated to the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair value 
fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based upon available information and may involve us engaging an independent third party to perform an appraisal 
estimating fair values can be complex and subject to significant business judgment 
estimates most commonly impact property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  including those with indefinite lives 
generally  we have  if necessary  up to one year from the acquisition date to finalize the purchase price allocation 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting guidance
