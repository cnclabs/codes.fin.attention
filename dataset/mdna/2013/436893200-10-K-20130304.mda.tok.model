overview our net income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in on a diluted earnings per share basis  our net earnings increased to for the year ended december   as compared to for the same period in one of the primary reasons for the increase in net income from to is the lower provision for loan losses 
the company was able to reduce its provision for loan losses from million in to million for as a result of improving asset quality during during  the company acquired six failed institutions in fdic assisted acquisitions 
these acquisitions resulted in million of bargain purchase gains and million of merger expenses during we did not have any acquisitions during however  we were able to increase net interest income from to by million as a result of the additional earning assets obtained in our fdic assisted transactions combined with a basis point improvement in net interest margin

we prepare our consolidated financial statements based on the selection of certain accounting policies  generally accepted accounting principles and customary practices in the banking industry 
these policies  in certain areas  require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our accounting policies are described in detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this document 
we consider a policy critical if i the accounting estimate requires assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the accounting estimate  and ii different estimates that could reasonably have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on our financial statements 
using these criteria  we believe that the accounting policies most critical to us are those associated with our lending practices  including the accounting for the allowance for loan losses  foreclosed assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes and stock options 
investments 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity and other comprehensive income loss  net of taxes 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities that may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
loans receivable not covered by loss share and allowance for loan losses 
substantially all of our loans receivable not covered by loss share are reported at their outstanding principal balance adjusted for any charge offs  as it is management s intent to hold them for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff  except for mortgage loans held for sale 
interest income on loans is accrued over the term of the loans based on the principal balance outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against income 
the allowance represents an amount that  in management s judgment  will be adequate to absorb probable credit losses on identifiable loans that may become uncollectible and probable credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
the amounts of provisions for loan losses are based on management s analysis and evaluation of the loan portfolio for identification of problem credits  internal and external factors that may affect collectability  relevant credit exposure  particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending  current collateral values and other relevant factors 
the allowance consists of allocated and general components 
the allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired 
for those loans that are classified as impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows  or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 
the general component covers non classified loans and is based on historical charge off experience and expected loss given default derived from the bank s internal risk rating process 
other adjustments may be made to the allowance for pools of loans after an assessment of internal or external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 

table of contents loans considered impaired  under fasb asc  are loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the aggregate amount of impairment of loans is utilized in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and amount of provisions thereto 
losses on impaired loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when in the process of collection it appears likely that such losses will be realized 
the accrual of interest on impaired loans is discontinued when  in management s opinion  the borrower may be unable to meet payments as they become due 
when accrual of interest is discontinued  all unpaid accrued interest is reversed 
groups of loans with similar risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the group s historical loss experience adjusted for changes in trends  conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans 
loans are placed on non accrual status when management believes that the borrower s financial condition  after giving consideration to economic and business conditions and collection efforts  is such that collection of interest is doubtful  or generally when loans are days or more past due 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely 
accrued interest related to non accrual loans is generally charged against the allowance for loan losses when accrued in prior years and reversed from interest income if accrued in the current year 
interest income on non accrual loans may be recognized to the extent cash payments are received  although the majority of payments received are usually applied to principal 
non accrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when principal and interest payments are less than days past due  the customer has made required payments for at least nine months  and we reasonably expect to collect all principal and interest 
acquisition accounting  covered loans and related indemnification asset 
beginning in  the company accounts for its acquisitions under asc topic  business combinations  which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting 
all identifiable assets acquired  including loans  are recorded at fair value 
no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk 
loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in asc topic  exclusive of the shared loss agreements with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fair value estimates associated with the loans include estimates related to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of undiscounted expected principal  interest and other cash flows 
over the life of the acquired loans  the company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on pools of loans sharing common risk characteristics  which are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques 
the company evaluates at each balance sheet date whether the present value of its pools of loans determined using the effective interest rates has decreased and if so  recognizes a provision for loan loss in its consolidated statement of income 
for any increases in cash flows expected to be collected  the company adjusts the amount of accretable yield recognized on a prospective basis over the pool s remaining life 
because the fdic will reimburse the company for certain acquired loans should the company experience a loss  an indemnification asset is recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the indemnification asset is recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans  and measured on the same basis  subject to collectability or contractual limitations 
the shared loss agreements on the acquisition date reflect the reimbursements expected to be received from the fdic  using an appropriate discount rate  which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
the shared loss agreements continue to be measured on the same basis as the related indemnified loans 
because the acquired loans are subject to the accounting prescribed by asc topic  subsequent changes to the basis of the shared loss agreements also follow that model 
deterioration in the credit quality of the loans immediately recorded as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses would immediately increase the basis of the shared loss agreements  with the offset recorded through the consolidated statement of income 
increases in the credit quality or cash flows of loans reflected as an adjustment to yield and accreted into income over the weighted average life of the loans decrease the basis of the shared loss agreements  with such decrease being accreted into income over the same period or the life of the shared loss agreements  whichever is shorter 
loss assumptions used in the basis of the indemnified loans are consistent with the loss assumptions used to measure the indemnification asset 
fair value accounting incorporates into the fair value of the indemnification asset an element of the time value of money  which is accreted back into income over the life of the shared loss agreements 
upon the determination of an incurred loss the indemnification asset will be reduced by the amount owed by the fdic 
a corresponding  claim receivable is recorded until cash is received from the fdic 

table of contents foreclosed assets held for sale 
assets acquired by foreclosure or in settlement of debt and held for sale are valued at estimated fair value as of the date of foreclosure  and a related valuation allowance is provided for estimated costs to sell the assets 
management evaluates the value of foreclosed assets held for sale periodically and increases the valuation allowance for any subsequent declines in fair value 
changes in the valuation allowance are charged or credited to gain or loss on oreo 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess intangible value of acquired deposit customer relationships as determined by valuation specialists 
the core deposit intangibles are being amortized over to months on a straight line basis 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is evaluated for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill and core deposit intangibles as required by fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other in the fourth quarter 
income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with income tax accounting guidance asc  income taxes 
the income tax accounting guidance results in two components of income tax expense current and deferred 
current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period by applying the provisions of the enacted tax law to the taxable income or excess of deductions over revenues 
the company determines deferred income taxes using the liability or balance sheet method 
under this method  the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and enacted changes in tax rates and laws are recognized in the period in which they occur 
deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods 
deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the tax position will be realized or sustained upon examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent  the terms examined and upon examination also include resolution of the related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the determination of whether or not a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold considers the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date and is subject to the management s judgment 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of evidence available  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns 
its subsidiaries provide for income taxes on a separate return basis  and remits to the company amounts determined to be currently payable 
stock options 
in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  and fasb asc  equity based payments to non employees  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant 
the company recognizes compensation expense for the grant date fair value of the option award over the vesting period of the award

while we seek to be a successful bidder to the fdic on one or more additional failed depository institutions within our targeted markets  there is no assurance that we will be the winning bidder on other fdic assisted transactions 
we will continue evaluating all types of potential bank acquisitions to determine what is in the best interest of our company 
our goal in making these decisions is to maximize the return to our investors 
branches we intend to continue opening new commonly referred to as de novo branches in our current markets and in other attractive market areas if opportunities arise 
during  and no de novo branches were opened

additionally  we incurred million of investments security losses from fraudulent bonds in during  we were able to record a gain from the collection of million in insurance proceeds on these bonds 
net interest income net interest income  our principal source of earnings  is the difference between the interest income generated by earning assets and the total interest cost of the deposits and borrowings obtained to fund those assets 
factors affecting the level of net interest income include the volume of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  yields earned on loans and investments and rates paid on deposits and other borrowings  the level of non performing loans and the amount of non interest bearing liabilities supporting earning assets 
net interest income is analyzed in the discussion and tables below on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
the adjustment to convert certain income to a fully taxable equivalent basis consists of dividing tax exempt income by one minus the combined federal and state income tax rate 
the federal reserve board sets various benchmark rates  including the federal funds rate  and thereby influences the general market rates of interest  including the deposit and loan rates offered by financial institutions 
the federal funds rate  which is the cost to banks of immediately available overnight funds  began in at 
during  the rate decreased to basis points to a low of to on december   where the rate has remained

the allowance is increased  as necessary  by making a provision for loan losses 
the specific allocations for impaired loans are assigned based on an estimated net realizable value after a thorough review of the credit relationship 
the potential loss factors associated with the remainder of the loan portfolio are based on an internal net loss experience  as well as management s review of trends within the portfolio and related industries 
while general economic trends have improved in the past year  we cannot be certain that the current economic conditions will considerably improve in the near future 
recent and ongoing events at the national and international levels continue to create uncertainty in the financial markets 
despite these economic uncertainties  we continue to follow our historically conservative procedures for lending and evaluating the provision and allowance for loan losses 
our practice continues to be primarily traditional real estate lending with strong loan to value ratios 

table of contents generally  commercial  commercial real estate  and residential real estate loans are assigned a level of risk at origination 
thereafter  these loans are reviewed on a regular basis 
the periodic reviews generally include loan payment and collateral status  the borrowers financial data  and key ratios such as cash flows  operating income  liquidity  and leverage 
a material change in the borrower s credit analysis can result in an increase or decrease in the loan s assigned risk grade 
aggregate dollar volume by risk grade is monitored on an on going basis 
our management reviews certain key loan quality indicators on a monthly basis  including current economic conditions  delinquency trends and ratios  portfolio mix changes  and other information management deems necessary 
this review process provides a degree of objective measurement that is used in conjunction with periodic internal evaluations 
to the extent that this review process yields differences between estimated and actual observed losses  adjustments are made to the loss factors used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
our company is primarily a real estate lender in the markets we serve 
as such  we are subject to declines in asset quality when real estate prices fall during a recession 
the recent recession has harshly impacted the real estate market in florida 
the economic conditions particularly in our florida market have improved over the past year  although not to pre recession levels 
our arkansas markets economies have been fairly stable over the past several years with no boom or bust 
as a result  the arkansas economy fared better with its real estate values during this time period 
the provision for loan losses represents management s determination of the amount necessary to be charged against the current period s earnings  to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is considered adequate in relation to the estimated risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the provision for non covered loans was million for the year ended december   million for december   and million for the provision for covered loans was million for the year ended december  our provision for loan losses for non covered loans decreased million  or to million for the year ended december   from million for the net loans charged off for non covered loans for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period in the provision for loan losses for non covered loans in our florida market was approximately  for the decrease in the provision for loan losses for non covered loans from to is primarily associated with the million improvement in non performing loans when excluding million of non performing loans acquired through the heritage and premier transactions 
impairment testing on the estimated cash flows of the covered loans during established that two pools evaluated had experienced projected credit deterioration 
as a result of this projection  we recorded a million provision for loan losses to the allowance for loan losses related to the purchased impaired loans during the year 
since these loans are covered by loss share with the fdic  we were able to increase its indemnification asset by million resulting in a net provision for loan losses of million 
our current or historical provision levels should not be relied upon as a predictor or indicator of future levels going forward 
of the million net charged off for the non covered impaired loans  approximately million is from our florida market 
the remaining million predominately relates to net charge offs on loans in our arkansas market

table of contents additional details on some of the more significant changes are as follows the million increase in service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges and fees is primarily from our acquisitions of vision  heritage and premier plus increased inter change transaction activity 
the million increase in mortgage lending income is primarily related to increased mortgage lending activities resulting from the historically low rate environment during plus additional volume from the acquisitions of vision  heritage and premier 
the  increase in dividends from fhlb  frb  bankers bank and other is primarily from a non recurring dividend of approximately  from our investment in a private equity and venture capital firm which invests in small and lower middle market companies located in arkansas and across the midwest and southeast united states 
a  gain on sale of premises and equipment was realized on the sale of an adjacent property next to one of our existing branch locations during during  we were able record a gain from the collection of million in insurance proceeds on fraudulent bonds charged off in the increase in other income is primarily from our acquisition of vision plus new rental income

this lease produced approximately  of rental income during non interest income excluding gains on acquisitions increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in additional details on some of the more significant changes are as follows the million of additional income from fdic indemnification accretion 
the million increase in service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges and fees primarily associated with growth from our fdic assisted acquisitions 
because the fdic will reimburse us for certain acquired loans should we experience a loss  an indemnification asset was recorded at fair value at the acquisition date 
the difference between the fair value recorded at the acquisition date and the gross reimbursements expected to be received from the fdic are accreted into income over the life of the indemnification asset using an appropriate discount rate  which reflects counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties 
because of this time value of money type accretion  the accretion amounts are expected to be higher in initial periods and decline during future periods 
in addition  we will see further reductions as pools evaluated by the company are determined to have a materially projected credit improvement 
improvements in credit quality decrease the basis in the related indemnification assets 
this positive event will reduce the indemnification asset 
this reduction will be amortized over the weighted average life of the loans or the life of the shared loss agreements  whichever is shorter 
the amortization will be shown as a reduction to fdic indemnification non interest income going forward 
during future periods  the amortization could offset the accretion in its entirety

troubled debt restructurings tdr generally occur when a borrower is experiencing  or is expected to experience  financial difficulties in the near term 
as a result  the bank will work with the borrower to prevent further difficulties  and ultimately to improve the likelihood of recovery on the loan 

table of contents during the recent real estate crisis  for the nation in general and florida in particular  it has become more common to restructure or modify the terms of certain loans under certain conditions 
in those circumstances it may be beneficial to restructure the terms of a loan and work with the borrower for the benefit of both parties  versus forcing the property into foreclosure and having to dispose of it in an unfavorable and depressed real estate market 
when we have modified the terms of a loan  we usually either reduce the monthly payment and or interest rate for generally about three to twelve months 
for our troubled debt restructurings that accrue interest at the time the loan is restructured  it would be a rare exception to have charged off any portion of the loan 
only non performing restructured loans are included in our non performing non covered loans 
as of december   we had million of non covered restructured loans that are in compliance with the modified terms and are not reported as past due or non accrual in table our florida market contains million of these non covered restructured loans 
to facilitate this process  a loan modification that might not otherwise be considered may be granted resulting in classification as a troubled debt restructuring 
these loans can involve loans remaining on non accrual  moving to non accrual  or continuing on an accrual status  depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the borrower 
generally  a non accrual loan that is restructured remains on non accrual for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms 
however  performance prior to the restructuring  or significant events that coincide with the restructuring  are considered in assessing whether the borrower can pay the new terms and may result in the loan being returned to an accrual status after a shorter performance period 
if the borrower s ability to meet the revised payment schedule is not reasonably assured  the loan will remain in a nonaccrual status 
the majority of the bank s loan modifications relate to commercial lending and involve reducing the interest rate  changing from a principal and interest payment to interest only  a lengthening of the amortization period  or a combination of some or all of the three 
in addition  it is common for the bank to seek additional collateral or guarantor support when modifying a loan 
the amount of troubled debt restructurings had been increasing through as the bank continued to work with borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulties 
at december   the amount of troubled debt restructurings was million  an increase of from million at december  and of all restructured loans were performing to the terms of the restructure as of december  and  respectively

as of december   average non covered impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  the adoption of asu no 
during the third quarter of which required troubled debt restructurings to be classified as impaired loans was primarily the reason for the increase in average non covered impaired loans 
as of december   non covered impaired loans were million compared to million as of december  for a decrease of million 
a million reduction in loan balances for impaired loans not classified as tdr s offset by a million increase in impaired loans classified as tdrs as of december  when compared to december  accounted for this decrease 
as of december   our florida and alabama markets accounted for million and million of the non covered impaired loans  respectively 
we evaluated loans purchased in conjunction with the fdic assisted acquisitions and the acquisitions of heritage and premier for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality 
purchased loans are considered impaired if there is evidence of credit deterioration since origination and if it is probable that not all contractually required payments will be collected 
all loans acquired in these transactions were deemed to be impaired loans 
these loans were not classified as nonperforming assets at december  and  as the loans are accounted for on a pooled basis and the pools are considered to be performing 
therefore  interest income  through accretion of the difference between the carrying amount of the loans and the expected cash flows  is being recognized on all purchased impaired loans

table of contents allowance for loan losses overview 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which our management believes is adequate to absorb all probable losses on loans in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provision of possible loan losses charged to income  which increases the allowance 
in determining the provision for possible loan losses  it is necessary for our management to monitor fluctuations in the allowance resulting from actual charge offs and recoveries and to periodically review the size and composition of the loan portfolio in light of current and anticipated economic conditions 
if actual losses exceed the amount of allowance for loan losses  our earnings could be adversely affected 
as we evaluate the allowance for loan losses  we categorize it as follows i specific allocations  ii allocations for criticized and classified assets with no specific allocation  iii general allocations for each major loan category  and iv miscellaneous allocations 
specific allocations 
as a general rule  if a specific allocation is warranted  it is the result of an analysis of a previously classified credit or relationship 
typically  when it becomes evident through the payment history or a financial statement review that a loan or relationship is no longer supported by the cash flows of the asset and or borrower and has become collateral dependent  we will use appraisals or other collateral analysis to determine if collateral impairment has occurred 
the amount or likelihood of loss on this credit may not yet be evident  so a charge off would not be prudent 
however  if the analysis indicates that an impairment has occurred  then a specific allocation will be determined for this loan 
if our existing appraisal is outdated or the collateral has been subject to significant market changes  we will obtain a new appraisal for this impairment analysis 
the majority of the company s impaired loans are collateral dependent at the present time  so third party appraisals were used to determine the necessary impairment for these loans 
cash flow available to service debt was used for the other impaired loans 
this analysis is performed each quarter in connection with the preparation of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  and if necessary  adjustments are made to the specific allocation provided for a particular loan 
for collateral dependent loans  we do not consider an appraisal outdated simply due to the passage of time 
however  if market or other conditions have deteriorated and we believe that the current market value of the property is not within approximately of the appraised value  we will consider the appraisal outdated and order a new appraisal for the impairment analysis 
the recognition of any provision or related charge off on a collateral dependent loan is either through annual credit analysis or  many times  when the relationship becomes delinquent 
if the borrower is not current  we will update our credit and cash flow analysis to determine the borrower s repayment ability 
if we determine this ability does not exist and it appears that the collection of the entire principal and interest is not likely  then the loan could be placed on non accrual status 
in any case  loans are classified as non accrual no later than days past due 
if the loan requires a quarterly impairment analysis  this analysis is completed in conjunction with the completion of the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
any exposure identified through the impairment analysis is shown as a specific reserve on the individual impairment 
if it is determined that a new appraisal is required  it is ordered and will be taken into consideration during the next completion of the impairment analysis 
between the receipt of the original appraisal and the updated appraisal  we monitor the loan s repayment history and subject the loan to examination by our internal loan review 
if the loan is over million  our policy requires an annual credit review 
in addition  we update all financial information and calculate the global repayment ability of the borrower guarantors 
in estimating the net realizable value of the collateral  management may deem it appropriate to discount the appraisal based on the applicable circumstances 
in such case  the amount charged off may result in loan principal outstanding being below fair value as presented in the appraisal 
as a general rule  when it becomes evident that the full principal and accrued interest of a loan may not be collected  or by law at days past due  we will reflect that loan as nonperforming 
it will remain nonperforming until it performs in a manner that it is reasonable to expect that we will collect the full principal and accrued interest 

table of contents when the amount or likelihood of a loss on a loan has been determined  a charge off should be taken in the period it is determined 
if a partial charge off occurs  the quarterly impairment analysis will determine if the loan is still impaired  and thus continues to require a specific allocation 
allocations for criticized and classified assets not individually evaluated for impairment 
we establish allocations for loans rated special mention through loss in accordance with the guidelines established by the regulatory agencies 
a percentage rate is applied to each loan category to determine the level of dollar allocation 
general allocations 
we establish general allocations for each major loan category 
this section also includes allocations to loans  which are collectively evaluated for loss such as residential real estate  commercial real estate  consumer loans and commercial and industrial loans 
the allocations in this section are based on a historical review of loan loss experience and past due accounts 
we give consideration to trends  changes in loan mix  delinquencies  prior losses  and other related information 
miscellaneous allocations 
allowance allocations other than specific  classified  and general are included in our miscellaneous section 
charge offs and recoveries 
total charge offs decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in total recoveries decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in for the year ended december   the net charge offs were million for arkansas and million for florida  respectively  equaling a net charge off position of million 
during  there were million in charge offs and million in recoveries 
while the charge offs and recoveries consisted of many relationships  there were no individual relationships consisting of charge offs greater than million for the year ended december   the net recoveries were million for arkansas and net charge offs were million for florida equaling a net charge off position of million 
during  we had four large recoveries and two large charge offs greater than million related to debt settlement 
these recoveries ranged from million to million and totaled million of the million recovered during these charge offs ranged from million to million and totaled million of the million charged off during specifically  the most significant arkansas charge offs and recoveries during consisted of the following a relationship consisting primarily of several construction loans totaling million of debt 
the total amount of charge offs related to these loans was million during a relationship including the largest of the arkansas recoveries 
these recoveries were primarily related to two debt settlement arrangements totaling million 
the largest of these settlements was million received from litigation and million received from collection action 
a relationship that included a large multi family property in central arkansas 
this property was placed in foreclosed assets during the second quarter of the carrying value of this non covered property was million and it sold for million during the third quarter of because this property was settled within days of foreclosure  the million difference is reflected as a recovery 

table of contents the remaining million and million of the arkansas charge offs and recoveries  respectively  consisted of many relationships with no individual relationship consisting of charge offs or recoveries greater than million 
specifically  the significant florida charge offs and recoveries during consisted of the following a relationship with one non farm non residential loan totaling million 
the total amount of the charge off related to this loan was million during a relationship including two loans totaling million 
a total of million was recovered related to these loans during the third quarter of the remaining million and  of the florida charge offs and recoveries  respectively  consisted of many relationships with no individual relationship consisting of charge offs or recoveries greater than million 
the charge offs primarily represent loans which had already been fully reserved with specific reserve allocations 
more specifically  in during we charged off approximately million on loans that were eligible for a specific reserve and the allocation on those loans totaled approximately million 
the charge offs  recoveries and net charge offs are reflective of the proactive stance we take on asset quality issues 
we have not charged off an amount less than what was determined to be the fair value of the collateral as presented in the appraisal for any period presented 
loans partially charged off are generally placed on non accrual status until it is proven that the borrower s repayment ability with respect to the remaining principal balance can be reasonably assured 
this is usually established over a period of months of timely payment performance

table of contents allocated allowance for loan losses 
we use a risk rating and specific reserve methodology in the calculation and allocation of our allowance for loan losses 
while the allowance is allocated to various loan categories in assessing and evaluating the level of the allowance  the allowance is available to cover charge offs incurred in all loan categories 
because a portion of our portfolio has not matured to the degree necessary to obtain reliable loss data from which to calculate estimated future losses  the unallocated portion of the allowance is an integral component of the total allowance 
although unassigned to a particular credit relationship or product segment  this portion of the allowance is vital to safeguard against the imprecision inherent in estimating credit losses 
the changes for the period ended december  and in the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the individual types of loans are primarily associated with changes in the asc calculations  both individual and aggregate  and changes in the asc calculations 
these calculations are affected by changes in individual loan impairments  changes in asset quality  net charge offs during the period and normal changes in the outstanding loan portfolio  as well any changes to the general allocation factors due to changes within the actual characteristics of the loan portfolio

table of contents investment securities our securities portfolio is the second largest component of earning assets and provides a significant source of revenue 
securities within the portfolio can be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading based on the intent and objective of the investment and the ability to hold to maturity 
fair values of securities are based on quoted market prices where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  estimated fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable securities 
as of december  and  we had no held to maturity or trading securities 
securities available for sale are reported at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity as other comprehensive income 
securities that are held as available for sale are used as a part of our asset liability management strategy 
securities may be sold in response to interest rate changes  changes in prepayment risk  the need to increase regulatory capital  and other similar factors are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities were million as of december   compared to million as of december  the estimated effective duration of our securities portfolio was years as of december  as of december   million  or  of the available for sale securities were invested in mortgage backed securities  compared to million  or  of the available for sale securities in the prior year

certain investment securities are valued at less than their historical cost 
these declines are primarily the result of the rate for these investments yielding less than current market rates 
based on evaluation of available evidence  we believe the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary 
it is our intent to hold these securities to recovery 
should the impairment of any of these securities become other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized in net income in the period the other than temporary impairment is identified 
during  we became aware that fraudulent rural improvement district bonds had been sold to various financial institutions in arkansas 
as a result of the fraud the board of directors authorized a million other than temporary charge to our investment securities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and market risk management liquidity management 
liquidity refers to the ability or the financial flexibility to manage future cash flows to meet the needs of depositors and borrowers and fund operations 
maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity allows us to have sufficient funds available for reserve requirements  customer demand for loans  withdrawal of deposit balances and maturities of deposits and other liabilities 
our primary source of liquidity at our holding company is dividends paid by our bank subsidiary 
applicable statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the amount of dividends that may be declared by our bank subsidiary 
further  any dividend payments are subject to the continuing ability of the bank subsidiary to maintain compliance with minimum federal regulatory capital requirements and to retain its characterization under federal regulations as a well capitalized institution 
our bank subsidiary has potential obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loan customers 
many of these obligations and commitments to fund future borrowings to our loans customers are expected to expire without being drawn upon  therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting our liquidity position 
liquidity needs can be met from either assets or liabilities 
on the asset side  our primary sources of liquidity include cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  available for sale investment securities and scheduled repayments and maturities of loans 
we maintain adequate levels of cash and cash equivalents to meet our day to day needs 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  as of december  our investment securities and federal funds sold were million as of december  and million as of december  our investment portfolio is comprised of approximately or million of securities which mature in less than five years 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of securities were pledged as collateral for various public fund deposits and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
our commercial and real estate lending activities are concentrated in loans with maturities of less than five years 
as of december  and  approximately billion  or  and billion  or  respectively  of our total loans matured within one year and or had adjustable interest rates 
a loan is considered fixed rate if the loan is currently at its adjustable floor or ceiling 
additionally  we maintain loan participation agreements with other financial institutions in which we could participate out loans for additional liquidity should the need arise 
on the liability side  our principal sources of liquidity are deposits  borrowed funds  and access to capital markets 
customer deposits are our largest sources of funds 
as of december   our total deposits were billion  or of total assets  compared to billion  or of total assets  as of december  we attract our deposits primarily from individuals  business  and municipalities located in our market areas 
we may occasionally use our fed funds lines of credit in order to temporarily satisfy short term liquidity needs 
we have fed funds lines with three other financial institutions pursuant to which we could have borrowed up to million on an unsecured basis as of december  and these lines may be terminated by the respective lending institutions at any time 
we also maintain lines of credit with the federal home loan bank 
our fhlb borrowed funds were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
all of the and outstanding balance were issued as long term advances 
our fhlb borrowing capacity was million and million as of december  and december  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to satisfy our current operations 
market risk management 
our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
we do not hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 

table of contents asset liability management 
our management actively measures and manages interest rate risk 
the asset liability committees of the boards of directors of our holding company and bank subsidiary are also responsible for approving our asset liability management policies  overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings  and reviewing our interest rate sensitivity position 
one of the tools that our management uses to measure short term interest rate risk is a net interest income simulation model 
this analysis calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using base market rates and using a rising and a falling interest rate scenario 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the re pricing relationships for each of our products 
many of our assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to re price immediately  and proportional to the change in market rates  depending on their contracted index 
some loans and investments include the opportunity of prepayment embedded options  and accordingly the simulation model uses indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields 
our non term deposit products re price more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at our discretion 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet remains static and that its structure does not change over the course of the year 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to our credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on our net interest income 
for the rising and falling interest rate scenarios  the base market interest rate forecast was increased and decreased over twelve months by and basis points  respectively 
at december   our net interest margin exposure related to these hypothetical changes in market interest rates was within the current guidelines established by us 
table presents our sensitivity to net interest income as of december  table sensitivity of net interest income interest rate scenario percentage change from base up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points interest rate sensitivity 
our primary business is banking and the resulting earnings  primarily net interest income  are susceptible to changes in market interest rates 
it is management s goal to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risks 
a key element in the financial performance of financial institutions is the level and type of interest rate risk assumed 
the single most significant measure of interest rate risk is the relationship of the repricing periods of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the more closely the repricing periods are correlated  the less interest rate risk we assume 
we use repricing gap and simulation modeling as the primary methods in analyzing and managing interest rate risk 
gap analysis attempts to capture the amounts and timing of balances exposed to changes in interest rates at a given point in time
