critical accounting policies and estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the estimates that we make include allowances for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  income tax assets and insurance reserves 
estimates are based on historical experience  where applicable or other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates  actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see notes to financial statements note business description and summary of accounting policies 
revenue recognition we record revenues as services are provided to our customers 
revenues relate primarily to the provision of aviation and security services  which are typically billed at hourly rates 
these rates may vary depending on base  overtime and holiday time worked 
revenue for administrative services provided to other security companies are calculated as a percentage of the administrative service customer revenue and are recognized when billings for the related security services are generated 
revenue is reported net of applicable taxes 
accounts receivable we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them to be uncollectible 
intangible assets intangible assets are stated at cost and consist primarily of customer lists and borrowing costs that are being amortized on a straight line basis over three to ten years  and goodwill  which is reviewed annually for impairment 
the life assigned to customer lists acquired is based on management s estimate of our expected customer attrition rate 
the attrition rate is estimated based on historical contract longevity and management s operating experience 
we test for impairment annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review  if earlier 
any potential impairment is evaluated based on anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and actual customer attrition in accordance with fasb asc  property  plant and equipment 
insurance reserves general liability estimated accrued liabilities are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and related data 
workers compensation annual costs are comprised of premiums as well as incurred losses as determined at the end of the coverage period  subject to minimum and maximum amounts 
workers compensation insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported as provided by a third party 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
the company continually monitors changes in claim type and incident and evaluates the workers compensation insurance accrual  making necessary adjustments based on the evaluation of these qualitative data points 
income taxes income taxes are based on income loss for financial reporting purposes and reflect a current tax liability asset for the estimated taxes payable recoverable in the current year tax return and changes in deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax laws and rates 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
in the event that interest and or penalties are assessed in connection with our tax filings  interest will be recorded as interest expense and penalties as selling  general and administrative expense 
stock based compensation fasb asc  stock compensation  requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at grant date and the recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share based compensation vests 
we use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  we recognize compensation expense in our financial statements issued subsequent to the date of adoption for all share based payments granted  modified or settled 
non cash charges of  and  for stock based compensation have been recorded for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
overview we principally provide uniformed security officers and aviation services to commercial  residential  financial  industrial  aviation and governmental customers through approximately offices throughout the united states 
in conjunction with providing these services  we assume responsibility for a variety of functions  including recruiting  hiring  training and supervising all operating personnel as well as paying such personnel and providing them with uniforms  fringe benefits and workers compensation insurance 
our customer focused mission is to provide the best personalized supervision and management attention necessary to deliver timely and efficient security solutions so that our customers can operate in safe environments without disruption or loss 
technology underpins our efficiency  accuracy and dependability 
we use a sophisticated software system that integrates scheduling  payroll and billing functions  giving customers the benefit of customized programs using the personnel best suited to the job 
renewing and extending existing contracts and obtaining new contracts are crucial to our ability to generate revenues  earnings and cash flow 
in addition  our growth strategy involves the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses in order to increase our scale within certain geographical areas  increase our market share in the markets in which we operate  gain market share in the markets in which we do not currently operate and improve our profitability 
we intend to pursue suitable acquisition opportunities for contract security officer businesses 
we frequently evaluate acquisition opportunities and  at any given time  may be in various stages of due diligence or preliminary discussions with respect to a number of potential acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we will identify any suitable acquisition candidates or  if identified  that we will be able to complete the acquisition of such candidates on favorable terms or at all 
the global security industry has grown largely due to an increasing fear of crime and terrorism 
in the united states  the demand for security related products and central station monitoring services also has grown steadily 
we believe that there is continued heightened attention to and demand for security due to worldwide events  and the ensuing threat  or perceived threat  of criminal and terrorist activities 
for these reasons  we expect that security will continue to be a key area of focus both domestically in the united states and abroad 
demand for security officer services is dependent upon a number of factors  including  among other things  demographic trends  general economic variables such as growth in the gross domestic product  unemployment rates  consumer spending levels  perceived and actual crime rates  government legislation  terrorism sensitivity  war external conflicts and technology 
results of operations earnings our net income for the fiscal years ended march  and was  and  respectively 
our net income was favorably impacted primarily by i the expansion of services provided under a contract with a major transportation company  ii expansion of aviation services with an existing customer at a domestic airport location  iii expansion of services to other new and existing security and aviation customers as noted below  iv a new contract to provide security services to an airport facility located in the upstate new york  lower amortization costs  and v lower interest expense 
the increase in net income was partially offset by i the previously reported loss of a security services contract for a semiconductor equipment manufacturer  ii reductions in service hours and rates coincident with the renewal of a contract with a major international carrier  iii the absence in the current period of two large airport construction contracts  iv reduction in service hours at a major hospital  v the loss of a service contract with a large international carrier in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year  vi an increase in general and administrative expenses primarily as a result of the previously announced and recently completed relocation and consolidation of the company s corporate headquarters to herndon  va  and vii an increase in income tax expense 
revenues our revenues increased by  or  to  for the fiscal year ended march   from  in the prior year 
the increase in revenues for the fiscal year ended march  was mainly due to i expansion of services provided under a contract with a major transportation company of approximately  ii expansion of aviation services with an existing customer at a domestic airport location of approximately  iii expansion of services to new and existing security and aviation customers as noted above that resulted in aggregate revenues of approximately  and iv a new contract to provide security services to an airport facility located in upstate new york of approximately  the increase in revenues was partially offset by i the previously reported loss of a security services contract for a semiconductor equipment manufacturer s facility of approximately  ii reductions in service hours and rates of approximately  associated with the renewal of a contract with a major international carrier  iii the absence in the current period of two large airport construction contracts of approximately  iv reduction in service hours at a major hospital of approximately  and v the loss of a service contract with a large international carrier in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year of approximately  gross profit our gross profit for the fiscal year ended march  increased  to  of revenues from  of revenues for fiscal this positive result was primarily driven by i expansion of services provided under a contract with a major transportation company  ii the expansion of aviation services with an existing customer at a domestic airport location  iii the expansion of services to new and existing security and aviation customers as noted above  iv a new contract to provide security services to an airport facility located in upstate new york and v the absence in the current year of professional and related fees principally associated with settlement of employment related claims in the comparable prior year 
the increase in gross profit was partially offset by i the previously reported loss of a security services contract for a semiconductor equipment manufacturers facility  ii reductions in service hours and rates associated with the renewal of a contract with a a major international carrier  iii the absence in the current period of two large airport construction contracts  iv reduction in service hours at a major hospital and v the loss of a service contract with a large international carrier in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year 
we have an insurance policy covering workers compensation claims in states in which we perform services 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on our historical loss experience and the ratio of claims paid to our historical payout profiles 
charges for estimated workers compensation related losses incurred and included in cost of sales were  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
the nature of our business also subjects us to claims or litigation alleging that we are liable for damages as a result of the conduct of our employees or others 
we insure against such claims and suits through general liability policies with third party insurance companies 
our insurance coverage limits are currently million per occurrence for non aviation related business with additional umbrella and excess liability policies of million and million  respectively and million per occurrence for aviation related business 
we retain the risk for the first  of general liability non aviation related operations   on airport wheelchair and electric cart operations   for damage to aircraft and  for skycap operations 
estimated accrued liabilities are based on specific reserves in connection with existing claims as determined by third party risk management consultants and actuarial factors and the timing of reported claims 
these are all factored into estimated losses incurred but not yet reported to us 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  of revenues from  of revenues in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from salaries and wages  mainly employee severance  duplicate personnel costs  duplicate facility costs and other expenses incurred in connection with our previously disclosed plan to consolidate and relocate our corporate headquarters to herndon  va 
this relocation was completed in january and the total cost including the aforementioned items was approximately million 
these increases were partly offset by lower amortization costs related to prior year acquisitions  lower legal costs and from reductions in other facility related costs 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts  net of recoveries  for the fiscal year ended march  increased by  to  from  in fiscal the increase is due to the timing and amounts of uncollectible accounts charged and or credited to expense between the current and prior year period and a reduction in bad debt recoveries 
bad debt recoveries for the years ending march  and march  were  and  respectively 
we periodically evaluate the requirement for providing for billing adjustments and or credit losses on our accounts receivable 
we provide for billing adjustments where our management determines that there is a likelihood of a significant adjustment for disputed billings 
criteria used by management to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts include  among others  the creditworthiness of the customer  current trends  prior payment performance  the age of the receivables and our overall historical loss experience 
individual accounts are charged off against the allowance as management deems them as uncollectible 
we do not know if bad debts will increase in future periods nor does our management believe that the increase during the fiscal year ended march  compared with the same period of the prior year is necessarily indicative of a trend 
interest income interest income was comparable for the fiscal years ended march  and  and principally represents interest earned on cash balances 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  decreased by  to  from  in fiscal the decrease in interest expense was due to lower average outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement with wells fargo and reduced borrowing rates  as described below 
equipment dispositions equipment dispositions are a result of the sale of vehicles  office equipment and security equipment at prices above or below book value 
the  and  gain on equipment dispositions for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  were primarily due to the disposition of company vehicles at amounts in excess of their respective book values 
loss gain on sale of investments the  loss on sale of investments for the fiscal year ended march  primarily represents carrying value in excess of proceeds for the sale of stock received under our claim related to the bankruptcy filings of delta and northwest airlines in september provision for income taxes the company s effective income rate decreased by to for the fiscal year ended march  from reported for fiscal pretax income increased by  to  in the fiscal year ended march  from  in fiscal the provision for income taxes increased by  to  for the fiscal year ended march  from  in fiscal primarily as a result of the aforementioned increase in pretax income  the recording of an allowance for the capital loss carry forward and a deferred tax charge for removing deferred tax assets related to expired stock options which  at the applicable statutory rate  added   and  respectively  to the company s provision for income taxes 
the remaining increase is related to non deductible expenses and other adjustments 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  we began paying employees and administrative service customers on a bi weekly basis  except for one operating location at which employees are paid weekly  while customers pay for services generally within days after billing by us 
we maintain a commercial revolving loan arrangement  currently with wells fargo bank  national association wells fargo 
we fund our payroll and operations primarily through borrowings under our million credit facility with wells fargo as amended  the credit agreement  described below under wells fargo revolving credit facility 
we principally use short term borrowings under our credit agreement to fund our accounts receivable 
our short term borrowings have supported the accounts receivable associated with our organic growth 
we intend to continue to use short term borrowings to support our working capital requirements 
we believe that our existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in the amount of available borrowings under our credit agreement  obtaining additional financing from other financial institutions or otherwise 
the failure by us to obtain such financing  if needed  would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations 
wells fargo revolving credit facility on february   we entered into a million credit agreement with wells fargo 
this credit agreement  which was amended in november as described below  matures in october  and contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including  among other things  covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios and is collateralized by customer accounts receivable and certain other assets of the company as defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a letter of credit sub line in an aggregate amount of up to million 
the credit agreement also provides for interest to be calculated on the outstanding principal balance of the revolving loans at the prime rate as defined in the credit agreement plus 
on november   we entered into a third amendment the third amendment to the credit agreement 
the third amendment i allows for the company to repurchase up to an additional  of its common stock  subject to certain conditions  ii provides for the consent of wells fargo to the consolidation and relocation of the company s headquarters and iii amends a financial covenant of the credit agreement for certain expenses associated with the consolidation and relocation of the company s headquarters 
as of march   the interest rate was for libor loans and for revolving loans 
closing costs for the credit agreement totaled  and were amortized over the original three year term of the credit agreement which ended in february at march   we had  in libor loans   of revolving loans and  under our letters of credit sub line outstanding under the credit agreement  representing approximately of the maximum borrowing capacity under the credit agreement based on our eligible accounts receivable as defined under the credit agreement as of such date 
we rely on our revolving loan from wells fargo which contains a fixed charge covenant and various other financial and non financial covenants 
if we breach a covenant  wells fargo has the right to immediately request the repayment in full of all borrowings under the credit agreement  unless wells fargo waives the breach 
for the fiscal year ended march   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
see notes to financial statements note borrowings 
other borrowings during the fiscal year ended march   we increased our libor borrowings by  increased our borrowings under the revolving loan by  and decreased our insurance financing borrowing by we may obtain short term financing to meet our annual property and casualty insurance needs 
for the fiscal years ended march  and   and  respectively  was borrowed for this purpose at annual interest rates of during both years at march  and  we had  and  respectively  of short term insurance borrowings outstanding 
such borrowings are collateralized by unearned premiums and dividends which may become payable under our insurance policies 
we have no additional lines of credit other than as described above 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the fiscal years ended march  and net cash provided used by operating activities  net cash provided used by investing activities  net cash provided used by financing activities  investments and capital expenditures we have no material commitments for investments and capital expenditures at this time 
financing the company uses borrowings under its credit agreement to meet its working capital needs and may obtain short term financing to meet its insurance needs 
see wells fargo credit facility and other borrowings above 
working capital our working capital increased by  or  to  as of march   from  as of march  there were checks issued in advance of deposits defined as checks drawn in advance of future deposits of  as of march   compared with  at march  cash balances and book overdrafts can fluctuate materially from day to day depending on such factors as collections  timing of billing and payroll dates  and are covered via advances from the revolving loan as checks are presented for payment 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 
outlook strategic initiatives our board of directors and management have initiated a number of strategic actions to improve the company s performance 
craig p 
coy joined the company as chief executive officer on january  during the past year  we implemented strategic initiatives designed to further increase efficiencies across the organization and lower the overall cost structure 
key elements of the company s on going initiatives include the consolidation of our corporate offices to a single office and streamlining of our management structure to integrate all of our functions into a common platform and deploy resources more efficiently was completed on february  renewed focus on operational performance  including managing overtime  to improve our operating margins and service delivery capabilities 
the upgrade and renewal of the company s enterprise operating platform to improve business processes  enhance on line management capabilities and provide improved management visibility into key performance metrics 
strategic new hires in the finance  operations  and human resources departments to continue to bring needed talent into the company 
an on going process to expand our sales and marketing team with the hiring of additional sales executives and talent to maximize our marketing opportunities 
on going reviews of our market position and product and service offerings to ensure that best in breed capabilities are brought to market 
these strategic initiatives may result in future costs related to severance and other employee related matters  litigation risks and expenses  and other costs 
at this time we are unable to determine the scope of these potential costs 
financial results our future revenues will largely depend on our ability to gain additional business from new and existing customers in our security and aviation services divisions at acceptable margins while minimizing terminations of contracts with existing customers 
in addition  our growth strategy involves the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses in order to increase our scale within certain geographical areas  increase market share in the markets in which we operate  enter new markets and improve our profitability 
we intend to pursue acquisition opportunities for contract security officer businesses 
our ability to complete future acquisitions will depend on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  negotiate acceptable terms for their acquisition and  if necessary  finance those acquisitions 
our security services division continues to experience organic growth over recent quarters and over the past few years  as demand for our security services has steadily increased 
our current focus is on increasing our revenues  as our sales and marketing team and branch managers work to develop new business and retain profitable contracts 
however  several of our airline and security services customers have reduced capacity within their systems  which typically results in reductions of service hours provided by us to such customers 
also  competition from other security services companies impacts our ability to gain or maintain sales  gross margins and or employees 
since september   the department of homeland security and the transportation security administration have implemented numerous security measures that affect airline operations  including expanded cargo and baggage screening  and may implement additional measures in the future 
additional measures taken to enhance either passenger or cargo security procedures in the future may increase the airline industry s demand for third party services provided by us 
additionally  our aviation services division is continually subject to such government regulation  which has adversely affected us in the past with the federalization of the pre board screening services and the document verification process at several of our domestic airport locations 
our gross profit margin increased during the fiscal year ended march  to of revenues  compared with for fiscal we expect our gross profit margins to average between and of revenue for fiscal year based on current business conditions 
we expect gross profit to remain under pressure due primarily to continued price competition  including competition from companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have 
however  we expect these effects will be moderated by continued operational efficiencies resulting from better management and leveraging of our cost structures  improved workers compensation experience ratings  workflow process efficiencies associated with our integrated financial software system and higher contributions from our continuing new business development 
as noted earlier  on february   we entered into a million credit agreement with wells fargo  which was amended on november   as described above 
as of the close of business on june   our cash availability was approximately  which we believe is sufficient to meet our needs for the foreseeable future barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
we believe that existing funds  cash generated from operations  and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our working capital  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  barring any increase in reserves imposed by wells fargo 
however  we cannot assure you that this will be the case  and we may be required to obtain alternative or additional financing to maintain and expand our existing operations through the sale of our securities  an increase in the amount of available borrowings under our credit agreement  obtaining additional financing from other financial institutions or otherwise 
the financial markets generally  and the credit markets in particular  continue to be volatile  both in the united states and in other markets worldwide 
the current market situation has resulted generally in substantial reductions in available loans to a broad spectrum of businesses  increased scrutiny by lenders of the credit worthiness of borrowers  more restrictive covenants imposed by lenders upon borrowers under credit and similar agreements and  in some cases  increased interest rates under commercial and other loans 
if we require alternative or additional financing at this or any other time  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available upon commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional financing when and if required by us  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected
