table of contents 
index to financial statements in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced a new management structure to enhance our worldwide technology markets focus and growth strategy  which we see in security and communication technologies 
this worldwide management structure creates new leadership roles and reporting segments to globally leverage the company leadership in specific technology markets 
as a part of this new structure  scansource has created two technology segments  each with its own president 
the two segments are worldwide barcode security  which includes scansource pos and barcode and scansource security business units  and worldwide communications services  which encompasses scansource catalyst  scansource communications and scansource services group business units 
the new reporting segments of worldwide barcode security and worldwide communications services will replace the geographic segments of north america and international and will give the company the ability to leverage our size and experience to deliver more value to our vendor and reseller partners in our existing markets 
management evaluates its businesses based on variants of return on invested capital as discussed later 
these measures can be applied to our vendor product lines in deciding where to make investments in inventory levels 
during the year  the company has concentrated more attention to product line returns and has adjusted our inventory investments accordingly as reflected in improved inventory turns to in the fourth quarter 
our distribution agreement with juniper networks ended in the first quarter of this fiscal year 
accordingly  sales of juniper products  which were primarily distributed by our scansource catalyst sales unit in north america and to a lesser extent by scansource communications europe  have significantly declined for the year ended june  compared to prior periods 
we restructured our european communications sales unit in the third quarter of this fiscal year in order to support a strategy for profitable growth 
the new organizational structure provided focused business unit leadership  as well as dedicated merchandising  sales and technical support teams  at the appropriate scale 
in addition  the company moved certain european support functions to centralized global teams in the united states to gain efficiencies 
the annualized cost savings in connection with the restructuring  principally associated with the elimination of positions  was estimated at approximately million 
the company incurred approximately million in associated costs  including related severance expenses 
these restructuring costs  which were accrued in the third quarter of the current fiscal year  are included in selling  general and administration costs in the accompanying consolidated income statements 
to the extent restructuring activities for this business are not successful  this could result in further losses or a valuation allowance for our net operating loss carry forward in belgium 
for further discussion on our restructuring  refer to note restructuring costs 
in fiscal  the company began developing a standardized enterprise resource planning erp system that was intended to be used throughout the world and provide operational efficiencies 
in january  through our wholly owned subsidiary partner services  inc psi  we filed a lawsuit in the us district court in atlanta  georgia against our former erp software systems integration partner  avanade  inc avanade 
the lawsuit alleges  among other things  fraud  tortious misrepresentation and breach of contract on the part of avanade in connection with its performance on the erp project 
psi is seeking recovery of damages that it has incurred and will continue to incur  as a result of avanade alleged misconduct 
the company engaged a new systems integration partner  tata consultancy services tcs  to replace avanade 
in march  tcs presented an integrated project plan that included the time and costs to complete the project 
this plan indicated that the effort remaining was going to approach the million upper end of our previously disclosed total project cost range with no assurance that the system would be successful 
in april  we moved a significant number of company team members who were working on our erp project back into business roles while we evaluated our alternatives for next steps 
these next steps were intended to be new plans which would assist the company in finishing the project with the microsoft dynamics ax software 
in connection with the preparation and review of the financial statements for the year ended june   the company reviewed the project and decided not to move forward with microsoft dynamics ax 
in the fourth quarter of the current year  we wrote off substantially all of the total capitalized expenses related to the original plan 
this decision was based on the indicators of impairment listed above 
the non cash charge recorded of million before the effect of income taxes million net of the tax impact  included software development costs  hardware  software interfaces and other related costs 
the remaining million of the total million capitalized balance is expected to be placed in service 
the software that will be placed into service is not the erp system itself  but an auxiliary database system designed to assist in the management of the product offerings 
prior to the write off  the capitalized software was included in property and equipment at cost on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we have impaired our erp dynamics software  we remain committed to the implementation of a new erp system 
we are currently evaluating our alternatives for next steps 
meanwhile  our legacy erp systems continue to run our business successfully 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we performed our annual impairment test as of june and determined that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary for our brazilian pos barcode and european communications reporting units 
prior to the test  no interim impairment indicators were identified 
the company impairment testing included the determination of the reporting unit fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
the impairment charges were a result of reduced earnings and cash flow forecast primarily due to the general macroeconomic environment and lower expectations of future results 
furthermore  earnout payments made to cdc shareholders have been lower than those forecasted and assumed in the calculation of goodwill  at the time of acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million and million in europe and brazil  respectively 
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  our latin america subsidiary experienced accounts receivable collection issues in venezuela 
the company transactions in venezuela are denominated in us dollars  however  our venezuelan resellers are having difficulties getting us dollars to pay us as the government controls the available us dollars within the country 
hence  we have heightened risk of collectability in this country 
at june   the company held million in accounts receivable and million in reserves specific to accounts receivable in venezuela 
the company is reviewing its strategy to mitigate risk in venezuela going forward 
our objective is to continue to grow profitable sales in the technologies we distribute and to focus on growth in security and communication technologies 
we continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions to enhance our technological and geographic portfolios 
in doing so  we face numerous challenges that require attention and resources 
certain business units and geographies are experiencing increased competition for the products we distribute 
this competition may come in the form of pricing  credit terms  service levels  product availability and in some cases  changes from a closed distribution sales model  in which resellers must purchase exclusively from one distributor  to an open distribution sales model  in which resellers may choose to purchase from multiple distributors 
as this competition could affect both our market share and pricing of our products  we may change our strategy in order to effectively compete in the marketplace 
cost control profitability our operating income growth is driven not only by gross profits but by a disciplined control of operating expenses 
our operations feature scalable information systems  streamlined management  and centralized distribution  enabling us to achieve the economies of scale necessary for cost effective order fulfillment 
from inception  we have managed our general and administrative expenses by maintaining strong cost controls 
however  in order to continue to grow in our markets  we have continued to invest in new technologies  specifically  security and communication  increased marketing efforts to recruit resellers  and enhanced employee benefit plans to retain employees 
evaluating financial condition and operating performance in addition to disclosing results that are determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we also disclose certain non gaap financial measures  including adjusted net income and adjusted eps  return on invested capital roic  and constant currency a measure that excludes the translation exchange impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates between reporting periods 
we use non gaap financial measures to better understand and evaluate performance  including comparisons from period to period 
these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools  and the non gaap financial measures that we report may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies 
analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be considered in addition to  and not in substitution for or as superior to  measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
adjusted net income and adjusted eps to evaluate current period performance on a clearer and more consistent basis with prior periods  we disclose adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps  which exclude charges mentioned above associated with the impairment of our erp software and goodwill in two of our reporting units  and costs associated with tax compliance and personnel replacement in the company local belgian office 
please see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on these items 
we believe that these historical items are outside of our normal operating expenses 
adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps are useful in better assessing and understanding our operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting results for future periods

index to financial statements below  we are providing a non gaap reconciliation of net income and earnings per share adjusted for the costs and charges mentioned above year ended june  pre tax income net income loss diluted eps gaap measures adjustments costs associated with belgian tax compliance and personnel replacement costs  including related professional fees impairment charges erp impairment charges goodwill non gaap measures return on invested capital we place a significant emphasis on roic in evaluating and monitoring financial condition and operating performance 
we use roic  a non gaap measure  as a performance measure to assess efficiency at allocating capital under our control to generate returns 
we believe this metric balances the company operating results with asset and liability management  excludes the results of capitalization decisions  is easily computed and understood  and is considered to have a strong correlation with shareholder value creation 
in addition  the company board of directors uses roic in evaluating business and management performance 
certain management incentive compensation targets are set and measured relative to roic 
we calculate roic as earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda divided by invested capital  with the adjustments discussed below 
invested capital is defined as average equity plus average daily funded interest bearing debt for the period 
the following table summarizes our return on invested capital ratio for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively return on invested capital ratio management adjusted the calculation of roic to exclude the impact of erp and goodwill impairment charges and costs associated with belgian tax compliance to provide a measure of the company profitability on a basis more comparable to historical or future periods 
had management not adjusted for the above mentioned items  the roic would have been for the fiscal year ended june  roic assists us in comparing our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that do not reflect our core operating performance both on a segment and on a consolidated basis 
we believe the calculation of roic including adjusted ebitda and adjusted average equity provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance during the year 
the components of our roic calculation and reconciliation to the company financial statements are shown  as follows reconciliation of ebitda to net income fiscal year ended june  in thousands net income gaap plus income taxes plus interest expense plus depreciation amortization ebitda adjustments impairment charges  including erp  goodwill belgian costs adjusted ebitda numerator for roic non gaap

the decrease in our return on invested capital from the prior year is largely the result of lower sales volumes and an increase in sg a expenses related to higher bad debt expenses for our international markets and an unfavorable increase in the fair value adjustment related to the cdc earn out see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information

these new segments are managed and reported separately as the markets and distribution channels are distinct 
this follows our strategy of focusing on the product markets separately and reflects how we operate the businesses 
we also believe this is more clear and understandable to investors 
the segment information presented herein reflects this change in our business segments 

table of contents 
index to financial statements currency in this management discussion and analysis  we make references to constant currency  a non gaap performance measure  that excludes the foreign exchange rate impact from fluctuations in the weighted average foreign exchange rates between reporting periods 
certain financial results are adjusted by translating current period results from currencies other than the us dollar using the comparable weighted average foreign exchange rates from the prior year period 
this information is provided to view financial results without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency rates  thereby enhancing comparability between reporting periods 
net sales the company has two reportable segments  which are based on product sales 
the following table summarizes the company s net sales results for each of these product categories and by geographic location for the comparable fiscal years ending june th segments change change in thousands worldwide barcode security worldwide communications services total net sales geographic sales change change in thousands north american sales units international sales units total net sales worldwide barcode security the barcode security distribution segment consists of sales to technology resellers in our scansource pos barcode business units in north america  europe and latin america and our scansource security business unit 
during fiscal year net sales for this segment decreased  primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange translation 
on a constant currency basis  net sales for fiscal increased million or 
the majority of the currency adjustment is from the change in the brazilian real 
the security and brazil pos barcode sales units had year over year growth rates excluding the impact of foreign currency translation 
the pos barcode sales units in north america and europe experienced a slight decline in revenue 
our latin america business unit had a slight increase in revenue 
worldwide communications services the communications services distribution segment consists of sales to technology resellers in our scansource communications business units in north america and europe  scansource catalyst in north america  and scansource services group 
during fiscal year  net sales for this segment declined compared to the prior fiscal year  with little change attributable to foreign currency exchange translation 
the decrease was largely attributable to the loss of juniper sales  which decreased approximately million year over year 
our distribution agreement with juniper networks ended in september scansource communications in north america had strong year over year growth 
sales for scansource catalyst and scansource communications in europe declined primarily from the loss of juniper sales as mentioned above

the gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales was unchanged for the fiscal year compared to fiscal year worldwide communications services gross profit for the communications services distribution segment decreased for the fiscal year ended june  this is the result of lower sales volume  primarily related to the loss of juniper revenues as described earlier 
the gross profit expressed as a percentage of net sales increased for fiscal year compared to fiscal year driven by improved product sales mix and vendor incentives 
operating expenses the following table summarizes the company s operating expenses for the periods ended june of sales june  change change in thousands selling  general and administrative expense impairment charges change in fair value of contingent consideration operating expense selling  general and administrative expense increased for the fiscal year ending june  as a result of an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended june  this increase was a result of increased expenses for the barcode security segment in all geographies offset by recoveries and reserve reductions in north america 
included in the barcode security expense is the increased country specific reserves for venezuela that occurred during the current fiscal year 
fiscal year selling  general and administrative expense also includes million in costs associated with belgian tax compliance and personnel replacement costs  including professional fees and million for restructuring costs associated with our communications business unit in europe 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded impairment charges from our erp project  and goodwill in our scansource communications europe and scansource brasil sales units as mentioned above 
discussion on these impairments can be found in the overview section of the md a as well as note property equipment and note goodwill in the notes to the consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements we have elected to present changes in fair value of the contingent consideration owed to former shareholders of cdc separately from other selling  general and administrative expenses 
in the current year  we have recorded a loss  driven by recurring amortization of the unrecognized fair value discount partially offset by income from changes to forecasted and actual results

worldwide communications services for the communications services distribution segment  operating income in dollars and as a percentage of sales decreased 
the change is attributable to lower gross margin dollars resulting from lower sales in fiscal year  the effect of the scansource communications europe restructuring costs  lower bad debt expenses and million of goodwill impairment charges 
corporate incurred a million loss relating to the erp impairment charge discussed previously

the decrease in interest expense is the result of lower average debt balances in the current year versus the prior year 
the company generates interest income on longer term interest bearing accounts receivable  cash invested in brazil to fund a portion of future earnout payments and to supplement local working capital needs  and  to a lesser extent  interest earned on cash 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and cash equivalent balances in locations other than brazil 
the reduction in interest income year over year is the result of lower cash balances in brazil in fiscal as compared to fiscal net foreign exchange gains and losses consist of foreign currency transactional and functional currency re measurements  offset by net foreign currency exchange contract gains and losses 
foreign exchange gains and losses are generated as the result of fluctuations in the value of the british pound versus the euro  the us dollar versus the euro  the us dollar versus the brazilian real and other currencies versus us dollar 
in september  we incurred a million non recurring loss in conjunction with an unfavorable forward exchange contract to purchase brazilian reais 
in august  the company decided to pre fund a portion of the estimated earnout payments associated with the cdc acquisition 
this contract was designed to preserve the currency exchange for the few weeks required to transfer the cash to brazil 
from the time that we entered into the contract through settlement  the real devalued from the contractual rate by  ultimately resulting in a million loss 
further contributing to the foreign exchange loss in fiscal  the brazilian business incurred significant losses on us dollar denominated exposures in the first quarter of fiscal that were not hedged at the time 
subsequently  we have been including these exposures in our hedging activities 
goodwill impairment charge we completed our annual impairment test as of june and determined that the book value of the european communications and the brazilian pos barcode sales units were in excess of fair value and a goodwill impairment was required 
prior to this test  no interim indicators of impairment were identified 
reduced earnings and cash flow forecast primarily due to the general macroeconomic environment and lower expectations of future results contributed to our determination 
furthermore  earnout payments made to cdc shareholders have been lower than those forecasted and assumed in the calculation of goodwill  at the time of acquisition 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash pretax goodwill impairment charge of million  or million after tax at the local tax rate  relating to our reporting units 
these goodwill charges are included in a separate operating expense line item  impairment charges including erp goodwill in our consolidated income statements 
income and market approaches were used to determine the fair value of each of our seven reporting units 
the application of goodwill impairment tests requires management judgment for many of the inputs 
key assumptions in the impairment test included our forecasted revenue growth rate  discount rate assumptions  and working capital requirements 
changes in these estimates could result in additional impairment of goodwill in a future period 
the impairment charge reflects our view of anticipated risks based on our expectations of market and general economic conditions 
annual impairment testing did not result in an impairment of goodwill for the years ended june  and for additional information regarding goodwill  see note goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
provision for income taxes income tax expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  reflecting an effective tax rate of and  respectively 
this increase in the effective tax rate is primarily the result of the nondeductible goodwill impairment in the united kingdom

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap or gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory reserves to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market  and vendor incentives 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  management believes that its estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable and that the actual results will not vary significantly from the estimated amounts 
for further discussion of our significant accounting policies  refer to note business and summary of significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized once four criteria are met the company must have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery must occur this includes the transfer of both title and risk of loss  provided that no significant obligations remain  the price must be fixed and determinable  and collectability must be reasonably assured 
the company allows its customers to return product for exchange or credit subject to certain limitations 
service revenue associated with configuration and marketing services is recognized when the work is complete and the four criteria discussed above have been substantially met 
we also distribute third party service contracts  typically for product maintenance and support 
since we act as an agent on behalf of most of these service contracts sold  revenue is recognized net of cost at the time of sale 
we also distribute some self branded warranty programs and engage a third party generally the original equipment manufacturer to cover the fulfillment of any obligations arising from these contracts 
these revenues and associated third party costs are amortized over the life of contract and presented in net sales and cost of goods sold  respectively 
service revenue associated with configuration  marketing  service contracts and other services approximated or less of consolidated net sales for fiscal years  and during the fiscal years ended june   and  the company has not engaged in any sales transactions involving multiple element arrangements 
had any arrangements with multiple deliverables occurred  we would follow the guidance set forth in accounting standards codification asc allowances for trade and notes receivable the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from customers failure to make payments on accounts receivable due to the company 
management determines the estimate of the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable by considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  and specific information obtained by the company on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of its customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of the company s customers to make payments on their accounts  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of the company s customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  the company may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
inventory reserves management determines the inventory reserves required to reduce inventories to the lower of cost or market based principally on the effects of technological changes  quantities of goods and length of time on hand  and other factors 
an estimate is made of the market value  less cost to dispose  of products whose value is determined to be impaired 
if these products are ultimately sold at less than estimated amounts  additional reserves may be required 
the estimates used to calculate these reserves are applied consistently 
the adjustments are recorded in the period in which the loss of utility of the inventory occurs  which establishes a new cost basis for the inventory 
this new cost basis is maintained until such time that the reserved inventory is disposed of

vendor programs the company receives incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors

actual recognition of the vendor consideration may vary from management estimates based on actual results 
share based payments the company accounts for share based compensation using the provisions of asc  accounting for stock compensation  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation 
share based compensation is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards  in accordance with the provisions of asc since this compensation cost is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the company has elected to expense grants of awards with graded vesting on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award

goodwill the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at a reporting unit level at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators exist 
our goodwill reporting units are those components that are one level below our worldwide barcode security and worldwide communications services operating segments for a total of seven reporting units 
the goodwill testing utilizes 
table of contents 
index to financial statements a two step impairment analysis  whereby the company compares the carrying value of each identified reporting unit to its fair value 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using the net present value of discounted cash flows generated by each reporting unit 
considerable judgment is necessary in estimating future cash flows  discount rates and other factors affecting the estimated fair value of the reporting units  including the operating and macroeconomic factors 
historical financial information  internal plans and projections  and industry information are used in making such estimates 
in the two step impairment analysis  goodwill is first tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit carrying amount to identify any potential impairment 
if fair value is determined to be less than carrying value  a second step is used whereby the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill  determined through a hypothetical purchase price allocation  is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is less than its carrying amount  an impairment charge is recorded in current earnings for the difference 
we also assess the recoverability of goodwill if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill may be impaired 
in our most recent annual test  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units primarily based on the discounted cash flow method 
we also utilized fair value estimates derived from the market approach utilizing the public company market multiple method to validate the results of the discounted cash flow method  which required us to make assumptions about the applicability of those multiples to our reporting units 
the discounted cash flow method required us to estimate future cash flows and discount those amounts to a present value 
the assumptions utilized in determining fair value included industry weighted average cost of capital wacc we utilized a wacc relative to each reporting unit respective geography and industry as the discount rate for estimated future cash flows 
the wacc is intended to represent a rate of return that would be expected by a market place participant in each respective geography 
operating income we utilized historical and expected revenue growth rates  gross margins and operating expense percentages  which varied based on the projections of each reporting unit being evaluated 
cash flows from working capital changes we utilized a projected cash flow impact pertaining to expected changes in working capital as each of our goodwill reporting units grow 
while we believe our assumptions are appropriate  they are subject to uncertainty and by nature include judgments and estimates regarding future events  including projected growth rates  margin percentage and operating efficiencies 
during fiscal  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million and million for our european communications and scansource brasil reporting units 
as of the latest annual goodwill impairment test  it was also estimated that the estimated fair value of our european pos barcode and scansource latin america reporting units exceeded their carrying values by smaller margins than the company other reporting units 
the carrying value of the european pos barcode and scansource latin america goodwill as of june  was million and million  respectively 
the estimated fair value of these goodwill reporting units exceeded the carrying value by and  respectively  in the most recent annual impairment test 
the increase in sensitivity to these goodwill reporting units are driven largely by the general macroeconomic environment and lower expectations for future results in the units 
key assumptions used in determining fair value include projected growth and operating margin  working capital requirements and discount rates 
while we do not believe that these goodwill reporting units are impaired at this time  if we are not able to achieve projected operating margins within the expected working capital requirements and or there are unfavorable changes to the discount rate  a future impairment of goodwill is at least reasonably possible 
see note goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our goodwill impairment testing and results 
liability for contingent consideration in addition to the initial cash consideration paid to former cdc shareholders  the company is obligated to make additional earnout payments based on future results through fiscal year based on a multiple of the subsidiary s pro forma net income as defined in the share purchase and sale agreement 
future payments are to be paid in brazilian currency  the real 
there are three remaining earnout payments payable in annual installments on august  and with the final payment on october  in accordance with asc topic  the company determines the fair value of this liability for contingent consideration at each reporting date throughout the term of the earnout using a discounted cash flow model following the income approach 
each period the company will reflect the contingent consideration liability at fair value with changes recorded in the change in fair value of contingent consideration line item on the consolidated income statement 
current and noncurrent portions of the liability are presented in the current portion of contingent consideration and long term portion of contingent consideration line items on the consolidated balance sheets

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under the million revolving credit facility  industrial revenue bond and our european subsidiary s million line of credit 
as a distribution company  our business requires significant investment in working capital  particularly accounts receivable and inventory  partially financed through our accounts payable to vendors and revolving lines of credit 
overall  as our sales volumes increase our net investment in working capital typically increases  which in general results in decreased cash flow from operating activities 
conversely  when sales volumes decrease  our net investment in working capital typically decreases  which in general  results in increased cash flow from operating activities 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at june   compared to million at june   of which million and million was held outside of the united states as of june  and  respectively 
we transferred million in september to our brazilian subsidiary in order to mitigate foreign exchange rate risk related to future earnout payments to former shareholders of cdc and to supplement our working capital needs in brazil 
cash balances are generated and used in many locations throughout the world 
prior to december   management s intent was to permanently reinvest these funds in our businesses outside the united states to continue to fund growth in our international operations 
during the third quarter  we reviewed and modified our policy toward permanently reinvested foreign earnings 
prospectively  the company will provide for us income taxes for the earnings of its canadian subsidiary 
earnings from all other geographies will continue to be considered retained indefinitely for reinvestment 
if these funds were needed in the operations of the united states  we would be required to record and pay significant income taxes upon repatriation of these funds 
see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
in the current year  we generated million of cash flows from operating activities as opposed to generating million in the prior year 
the increase in operating cash flows is largely the result of a decrease in inventory and receivables due to weaker demand and lower sales versus the prior year 
working capital increased million to million at june  from million at june  the primary reason for the increase in working capital is the million increase in cash in the fiscal year ended june  as the economic recovery continues  we maintain our commitment to extend reasonable credit terms to our resellers and make strategic inventory purchases to accommodate anticipated reseller demand for our vendors products 
the number of days sales in receivables dso was at june   june  and march   which is within our typically expected range

the lawsuit alleges  among other things  fraud  tortious misrepresentation and breach of contract on the part of avanade in connection with its performance on the erp project 
psi is seeking recovery of damages that it has incurred and will continue to incur  as a result of avanade alleged misconduct 
the company engaged a new systems integration partner  tata consultancy services tcs  to replace avanade 
in march  tcs presented an integrated project plan that included the time and costs to complete the project 
this plan indicated that the effort remaining was going to approach the million upper end of our previously disclosed total project cost range with no assurance that the system would be successful 
in april  we moved a significant number of company team members who were working on our erp project back into business roles while we evaluated our alternatives for next steps 
these next steps were intended to be new plans which would assist the company in finishing the project with the microsoft dynamics ax software 
as noted above in the overview  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have impaired our erp software  however  we remain committed to the implementation of a new erp system 
we are currently evaluating our alternatives for next steps
