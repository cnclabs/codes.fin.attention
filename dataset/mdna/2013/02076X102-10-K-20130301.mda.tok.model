table of contents part i item business overview we are one of america s premier coal suppliers  ranked third largest among publicly traded us coal producers as measured by consolidated revenues of billion 
we are the nation s leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal for use in the steel making process and a major supplier of thermal coal to electric utilities and manufacturing industries across the country as well as a growing exporter of thermal coal 
as of december   we operated mines and coal preparation plants in northern and central appalachia and the powder river basin  with approximately  employees 
we have two reportable segments eastern coal operations and western coal operations 
eastern coal operations consists of the mines in northern and central appalachia  our coal brokerage activities and our road construction business 
western coal operations consists of two powder river basin mines in wyoming 
our all other category includes an idled underground mine in illinois  expenses associated with certain closed mines  dry systems technologies  revenues and royalties from the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas extraction  equipment sales and repair operations  terminal services  the leasing of mineral rights  general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities 
steam coal  which is primarily purchased by large utilities and industrial customers as fuel for electricity generation  accounted for approximately of our coal sales volume 
metallurgical coal  which is used primarily to make coke  a key component in the steel making process  accounted for approximately of our coal sales volume 
metallurgical coal generally sells at a premium over steam coal because of its higher quality and its value in the steelmaking process as the raw material for coke 
we believe that the volume of the coal we sell will grow when and if demand for power and steel increases 
during  we sold a total of million tons of steam and metallurgical coal and generated coal revenues of billion 
ebitda from continuing operations was billion  and we incurred a loss from operations of billion 
we define and reconcile ebitda from continuing operations in item selected financial data 
our coal sales during consisted of million tons of coal  of which million was produced and processed by us  exclusive of coal purchased from third party brokerages 
we also purchased million tons from third parties  of which million tons we fully processed at our processing plants prior to resale  million tons we blended with our coal prior to resale  and million tons in raw product we shipped direct to our customers without any further processing or blending on our behalf 
approximately of our total revenues in was derived from sales made to customers outside the united states  primarily in canada  india  the netherlands  south korea and turkey 
as of december   we owned or leased approximately billion tons of proven and probable coal reserves  of which approximately billion tons are classified as metallurgical coal reserves 
of our total proven and probable reserves  approximately are low sulfur reserves  with approximately having sulfur content below 
approximately of our total proven and probable reserves have a high btu content which creates more energy per unit when burned compared to coals with lower btu content 
we believe that our total proven and probable reserves will support current production levels for more than years 
during the twelve months ended december   we announced the planned idling of certain mining operations and preparation plants in our eastern operations and other planned production curtailments as well as an organizational streamlining 
the mines impacted are located in virginia  west virginia  pennsylvania  kentucky and wyoming 
the combination of mine idlings  production curtailments and mining out of certain reserves will take place through early  and is expected to reduce production and shipments by approximately million to million tons compared to levels 
the majority of the reduction will come from higher cost thermal coal operations in the east and the power river basin 
these reductions will allow us to focus on higher margin products 
we will continue to evaluate market conditions and will make further adjustments if market conditions warrant 
our reorganization efforts will serve to reduce overhead while enhancing operational effectiveness as we align our structure to our smaller production footprint 
as part of our reorganization we established an operational performance group to support the deployment of best practices across the organization in areas such as operations improvement and preventive maintenance 
satellite offices in richmond  virginia  denver  colorado  latrobe  pennsylvania  and linthicum heights  maryland have been closed and overhead support functions are being consolidated from other locations as well 
we expect to achieve overhead savings from the streamlining of field and corporate support functions  which are expected to be reflected in lower cost of coal sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents during the twelve months ended december   we tested certain of our long lived assets and goodwill for impairment 
we recorded charges for asset impairment of  million and goodwill impairment of  million 
additionally  we recorded severance related expenses of million and million for professional fees 
additionally  we recorded other restructuring expenses of million related to reserves for advanced royalties and deposits which may not be recoverable and liabilities related to certain property leases that were terminated 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k related to asset impairment and restructuring expenses and goodwill impairment  respectively 
history old alpha as defined below was formed under the laws of the state of delaware on november  on february   an initial public offering of old alpha s common stock occurred and since then  we have grown substantially through a series of acquisitions 
the following are significant developments during our subsidiary  alpha terminal company  llc  increased its equity ownership position in dominion terminal associates dta from approximately to approximately  effectively increasing our coal export and terminal capacity at dta from approximately million tons to approximately million tons annually 
dta is a million ton annual capacity coal export terminal located in newport news  virginia 
old alpha sold its interest in gallatin materials llc gallatin  a start up lime manufacturing business in verona  kentucky  for cash in the amount of million 
the proceeds were used in part to repay the gallatin loan facility outstanding with nedbank limited in the amount of million 
old alpha recorded a gain on the sale of million in the third quarter of old alpha entered into a definitive merger agreement pursuant to which  and subject to the terms and conditions thereof  cliffs natural resources inc formerly known as cleveland cliffs inc 
cliffs would acquire all of old alpha s outstanding shares 
on november   old alpha commenced litigation against cliffs by filing an action in the delaware court of chancery to obtain an order requiring cliffs to hold its scheduled shareholder meeting 
during the fourth quarter of  old alpha and cliffs mutually terminated the merger agreement and settled the litigation 
the terms of the settlement agreement included a million payment from cliffs to old alpha which  net of transaction costs  resulted in a gain of million 
old alpha announced the permanent closure of the whitetail kittanning mine  an adjacent coal preparation plant and other ancillary facilities kingwood 
the mine stopped producing coal in early january and we ceased equipment recovery operations by the end of april the decision resulted from adverse geologic conditions and regulatory requirements that rendered the coal seam unmineable at this location 
old alpha recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of  which includes asset impairment charges of million  write off of advance mining royalties of million  which will not be recoverable  severance and other employee benefit costs of million and increased reclamation obligations of million 
on july   alpha natural resources  inc old alpha and foundation coal holdings  inc foundation merged the foundation merger with foundation continuing as the surviving legal corporation of the foundation merger which was renamed alpha natural resources  inc alpha 
for financial accounting purposes  the foundation merger was treated as a reverse acquisition and old alpha was treated as the accounting acquirer

during  we experienced a improvement in our incident rate and a reduction in our serious and substantial mine safety and health administration msha citations  as compared to construction of the running right leadership academy will provide a world class training facility that will integrate our running right program  with other safety  operations improvement and maintenance initiatives 
our ability to blend coals from our operations allows us to increase our coal revenues and gross margins while meeting our customer requirements 
the strategic locations of our mines and preparation plants provide us the ability to blend coals from our operations and increase coal revenues and gross margins while meeting our customer requirements 
we have long standing relationships with many of the largest coal burning utilities in the united states 
we supply coal to numerous power plants operated by a diverse group of electricity generators across the country 
we believe we have a reputation for reliability and superior customer service that has enabled us to solidify long term customer relationships 
we are the largest producer of metallurgical coal in the united states and have a broad base of international customers 
we are the largest producer of metallurgical coal in the united states and have the ability to serve international customers 
we have the capacity to ship in the range of to million tons annually through our access to international shipping points on the east and gulf coasts of the united states  including our ownership interest in dta 
our capacity and our international customer base are important to our metallurgical coal franchise and will be important as we grow our thermal export franchise 
business strategy our objective is to increase shareholder value and focus on free cash flow generation by creating a durable  sustainable steam coal portfolio  support and augment our metallurgical coal franchise and address non strategic operations 
our key strategies to achieve this objective are described below maintaining our commitment to operational excellence 
we seek to maintain our operational excellence with an emphasis on investing selectively in new equipment and advanced mining technologies 
we will continue to focus on profitability and efficiency by leveraging our significant economies of scale  large fleet of mining equipment  information technology systems and coordinated purchasing and land management functions 
in addition  we continue to focus on productivity through our culture of workforce involvement by leveraging our strong base of experienced  well trained employees 

table of contents capitalizing on industry dynamics through a balanced approach to selling our coal 
despite the volatility in coal prices over the past several years  we believe the long term fundamentals of the us and seaborne coal industries are favorable 
we plan to continue employing a balanced approach to selling our coal  including the use of long term sales commitments for a portion of our future production while maintaining uncommitted planned production to capitalize on favorable future pricing environments 
for example  as domestic demand for thermal coal from the central appalachia basin is tempered by abnormally low natural gas prices and an increasingly stringent regulatory environment  we may shift our strategy as necessary to increase export thermal sales to counter balance the tempered domestic demand 
selectively expanding our production and reserves 
given our broad scope of operations and expertise in mining in major coal producing regions in the united states  we believe that we are well situated to capitalize on the expected long term growth in international coal consumption and the continued consumption of significant volumes of coal in the us continuing to provide a mix of coal types and qualities to satisfy our customers needs 
by having operations and reserves in three major coal producing regions  we are able to source and blend coal from multiple mines to meet the needs of our domestic and international customers 
our broad geographic scope  mix of coal qualities and access to export terminal capacity provide us with the opportunity to work with many leading electricity generators  steel companies and other industrial customers across the country and much of the world 
continuing to focus on excellence in safety and environmental stewardship 
we intend to maintain our recognized leadership in operating some of the safest mines in the united states and in achieving environmental excellence 
our ability to minimize workplace incidents and environmental violations improves our operating efficiency  which directly improves our cost structure and financial performance 
coal mining techniques we use five different mining techniques to extract coal from the ground longwall mining  room and pillar mining  truck and shovel mining  truck and front end loader mining and highwall mining 
longwall mining we utilize longwall mining techniques at certain of our mines in the northern appalachia basin which is the most productive underground mining method used in the united states 
a rotating drum is trammed mechanically across the face of coal  and a hydraulic system supports the roof of the mine while the drum advances through the coal 
chain conveyors then move the loosened coal to a standard underground mine conveyor system for delivery to the surface 
continuous miners are used to develop access to long rectangular blocks of coal which are then mined with longwall equipment  allowing controlled subsidence behind the advancing machinery 
longwall mining is highly productive and most effective for large blocks of medium to thick coal seams 
high capital costs associated with longwall mining demand large  contiguous reserves 
ultimate seam recovery of in place reserves using longwall mining is much higher than the room and pillar mining underground technique 
all of the raw coal mined at our longwall mines is washed in preparation plants to remove rock and impurities 
room and pillar mining certain of our mines in the central appalachia basin utilize room and pillar mining methods 
in this type of mining  main airways and transportation entries are developed and maintained while remote controlled continuous miners extract coal from so called rooms by removing coal from the seam  leaving pillars to support the roof 
shuttle cars  continuous haulage or battery coal haulers are used to transport coal from the continuous miner to the conveyor belt for transport to the surface 
this method is more flexible than longwall mining and often used to mine smaller coal blocks or thin seams 
ultimate seam recovery of in place reserves is typically less than that achieved with longwall mining 
all of this production is also washed in preparation plants before it becomes saleable clean coal 
truck and shovel mining and truck and front end loader mining we utilize truck shovel and truck front end loader mining methods at our surface mines throughout our eastern and western operations 
these methods are similar and involve using large  electric or hydraulic powered shovels or diesel powered front end loaders to remove earth and rock overburden covering a coal seam which is later used to refill the excavated coal pits after the coal is removed 
the loading equipment places the coal into haul trucks for transportation to a preparation plant or loadout area 
ultimate seam recovery of in place reserves on average exceeds 
this surface mined 
table of contents coal typically does not need to be cleaned in a preparation plant before sale 
productivity depends on overburden and coal thickness strip ratio  equipment utilized and geologic factors 
highwall mining we utilize highwall mining methods at the surface mines in our eastern operations 
a highwall mining system consists of a remotely controlled continuous miner  which extracts coal and conveys it via augers or belt conveyors to the portal 
the cut is typically a rectangular  horizontal opening in the highwall the unexcavated face of exposed overburden and coal in a surface mine feet wide and reaching depths of up to  feet 
multiple parallel openings are driven into the highwall  separated by narrow pillars that extend the full depth of the hole 
coal characteristics in general  coal of all geological compositions is characterized by end use as either steam coal or metallurgical coal 
heat value  sulfur and ash content  and in the case of metallurgical coal  volatility  are the most important variables in the profitable marketing and transportation of coal 
these characteristics determine the best end use of a particular type of coal 
we mine  process  market and transport sub bituminous and bituminous coal  characteristics of which are described below 
heat value 
the heat value of coal is commonly measured in british thermal units  or btus 
a btu is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit 
alpha mines both sub bituminous and bituminous coal 
bituminous coal is located primarily in appalachia  arizona  the midwest  colorado  wyoming and utah and is the type most commonly used for electric power generation in the united states 
sub bituminous coal is used for industrial steam purposes  while bituminous coal  depending on its quality  can be used for both metallurgical and industrial steam purposes 
of our estimated billion tons of proven and probable reserves  approximately have a heat value above  btus per pound  which is considered high btu coal 
sulfur content 
sulfur content can vary from seam to seam and sometimes within each seam 
when coal is burned  it produces sulfur dioxide  the amount of which varies depending on the chemical composition and the concentration of sulfur in the coal 
low sulfur coals have a sulfur content of or less 
approximately of our proven and probable reserves are low sulfur coal 
high sulfur coal can be burned in plants equipped with sulfur reduction technology  such as scrubbers  which can reduce sulfur dioxide emissions by to 
plants without scrubbers can burn high sulfur coal by blending it with lower sulfur coal or by purchasing emission allowances on the open market  allowing the user to emit a predetermined amount of sulfur dioxide 
some older coal fired plants have been retrofitted with scrubbers  although most have shifted to lower sulfur coals as their principal strategy for complying with phase ii of the clean air act s acid rain regulations 
we expect that any new coal fired generation plants built in the united states will use clean coal burning technology and will include scrubbers 
ash moisture content 
ash is the inorganic residue remaining after the combustion of coal 
as with sulfur content  ash content varies from seam to seam 
ash content is an important characteristic of coal because electric generating plants must handle and dispose of ash following combustion 
the absence of ash is also important to the process by which metallurgical coal is transformed into coke for use in steel production 
moisture content of coal varies by the type of coal  the region where it is mined and the location of coal within a seam 
in general  high moisture content decreases the heat value and increases the weight of the coal  thereby reducing its value and making it more expensive to transport 
moisture content in coal  as sold  can range from approximately to of the coal s weight 
coking characteristics 
the coking characteristics of metallurgical coal are typically measured by the coal s fluidity  arnu and volatility 
fluidity and arnu tests measure the expansion and contraction of coal when it is heated under laboratory conditions to determine the strength of the coke that could be produced from a given coal 
typically  higher numbers on these tests indicate higher coke strength 
volatility refers to the loss in mass  less moisture  when coal is heated in the absence of air 
the volatility of metallurgical coal determines the percentage of feed coal that actually becomes coke  known as coke yield  all other metallurgical characteristics being equal 
coal with a lower volatility produces a higher coke yield and is more highly valued than coal with a higher volatility 
business environment coal is an abundant  efficient and affordable natural resource used primarily to provide fuel for the generation of electric power 
according to the us department of energy s energy information administration eia international energy outlook  world wide economically recoverable coal reserves using today s technology are estimated to be approximately 
table of contents billion tons 
also according to the eia international energy outlook  the united states is one of the world s largest producers of coal and has approximately of global coal reserves  representing about years of supply based on current usage rates 
according to the us department of energy  the energy content of the united states demonstrated recoverable coal reserves exceeds the world s proven oil reserves 
coal markets 
coal is primarily consumed by utilities to generate electricity 
it is also used by steel companies to make steel products and by a variety of industrial users to heat and power foundries  cement plants  paper mills  chemical plants and other manufacturing and processing facilities 
in general  coal is characterized by end use as either steam coal or metallurgical coal 
steam coal is used by electricity generators and by industrial facilities to produce steam  electricity or both 
metallurgical coal is refined into coke  which is used in the production of steel 
over the past forty years  total annual coal consumption in the united states excluding exports has more than doubled and remains close to one billion tons in actual preliminary projected annual growth consumption by sector tons in millions electric generation industrial steel production coal to liquids processes residential commercial export total data sourced from the us department of energy s eia s annual energy outlook 
preliminary data subject to change and finalization 
much of the nation s power generation infrastructure is coal fired 
as a result  coal has maintained an annual to market share during the past years according to the us department of energy eia s short term energy outlook  principally because of its relatively low cost  reliability and domestic abundance 
coal is a low cost fossil fuel used for base load electric power generation  typically being considerably less expensive than oil and generally competitive with natural gas 
coal fired generation is also competitive with nuclear power generation especially on a total cost per megawatt hour basis 
the production of electricity from existing hydroelectric facilities is inexpensive  but its application is limited both by geography and susceptibility to seasonal and climatic conditions 
through  non hydropower renewable power generation accounted for of all the electricity generated in the united states  and wind and solar power represented of united states power generation according to the us department of energy eia s short term energy outlook 
coal consumption patterns are also influenced by the demand for electricity  governmental regulation impacting power generation  technological developments  transportation costs  and the location  availability and cost of other fuels such as natural gas  nuclear and hydroelectric power 
coal s primary advantages are its relatively low cost and availability compared to other fuels used to generate electricity 
according to the eia  the estimated levelized cost of generation for various power generation technologies  entering service in are as follows

preliminary data subject to change and finalization 
coal regions 
coal is mined from coal fields throughout the united states  with the major production centers located in the western united states  northern and central appalachia and the illinois basin 
the quality of coal varies by region 
physical and chemical characteristics of coal are very important in measuring quality and determining the best end use of particular coal types 
competition 
the coal industry is intensely competitive 
with respect to our us customers  we compete with numerous coal producers in the appalachian region and illinois basin and with a large number of western coal producers 
competition from coal with lower production costs shipped east from western coal mines has resulted in increased competition for coal sales in the appalachian region 
in  imports accounted for a relatively small percentage of total u 
s coal consumption 
approximately of total us coal consumption in was imported 
excess industry capacity also tends to result in reduced prices for our coal 
the most important factors on which we compete are delivered coal price  coal quality and characteristics  transportation costs from the mine to the customer and the reliability of supply 
demand for coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for our coal are closely linked to coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric generation industry  which accounted for greater than of domestic coal consumption 
these coal consumption patterns are influenced by factors beyond our control  including the demand for electricity  which is significantly dependent upon summer and winter temperatures and commercial and industrial outputs in the united states  environmental and other government regulations  technological developments and the location  availability  quality and price of competing fuels for power  most notably natural gas  but also including nuclear  fuel oil and alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power 
demand for our low sulfur coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for it will also be affected by the price and availability of high sulfur coal  which can be marketed in tandem with emissions allowances in order to meet clean air act requirements 
demand for our metallurgical coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain for metallurgical coal will depend to a large extent on the demand for us and international steel  which is influenced by factors beyond our control  including overall 
table of contents economic activity and the availability and relative cost of substitute materials 
in the export metallurgical market we largely compete with producers from australia  canada  and other international producers of metallurgical coal

dominion terminal associates 
through our subsidiary alpha terminal company  llc  we hold a interest in dta  a million ton annual capacity coal export terminal located in newport news  virginia 
the terminal  constructed in  provides the advantages of unloading transloading equipment with ground storage capability  providing producers with the ability to custom blend export products without disrupting mining operations 
during we shipped a total of million tons of coal to our customers through the terminal 
we make periodic cash payments in respect of the terminal for operating expenses  which are offset by payments we receive for transportation incentive payments and for renting our unused storage space in the terminal to third parties 
in  we received cash payments related to the terminal of million partially offset by payments we made for expenses of million 
the terminal is held in a partnership with subsidiaries of two other companies  arch coal  inc and peabody energy corp 
coal handling joint venture 
in the massey acquisition  we acquired a interest in a joint venture that owns and operates third party end user coal handling facilities 
certain of our subsidiaries currently operate the coal handling facilities of the joint venture 
coal brokerage 
our coal brokerage group purchases and sells third party coal and serves as an agent of our coal subsidiaries 
miscellaneous 
we engage in the sale of certain non strategic assets such as timber  gas and oil rights as well as the leasing and sale of non strategic surface properties and reserves 
we also provide coal and environmental analysis services 
marketing  sales and customer contracts our marketing and sales force  which is principally based in bristol  virginia  included employees as of december   and consists of sales managers  distribution traffic managers  contract administrators and administrative personnel 
in 
table of contents addition to marketing coal produced at our operations  we also purchase and resell coal mined by others  the majority of which we blend with coal produced from our mines 
we have coal supply commitments with a wide range of electric utilities  steel manufacturers  industrial customers and energy traders and brokers 
our marketing efforts are centered on customer needs and requirements 
by offering coal of both steam and metallurgical grades to provide specific qualities of heat content  sulfur and ash  and other characteristics relevant to our customers  we are able to serve a diverse customer base 
this diversity allows us to adjust to changing market conditions and supports higher sales volumes and sales prices for our coal 
many of our larger customers are well established public utilities and steel manufacturers who have been stable long term customers of ours and our acquired companies 
we sold a total of million tons of coal in  consisting of million tons of coal produced and processed by us  and million tons of purchased coal 
a portion of purchased coal was blended prior to resale  meaning the coal was mixed with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  which generally allows us to realize a higher overall margin for the blended product than we would be able to achieve selling these coals separately 
a portion of purchased coal was processed by us  meaning that we washed  crushed or blended the coal at one of our preparation plants or loading facilities prior to resale 
a portion of purchased coal was sold direct to customers  meaning we did not wash  crush or blend the coal prior to resale 
we sold a total of million tons of coal in  consisting of million tons of coal produced and processed by us  and million tons of purchased coal

table of contents as is customary in the coal industry  when market conditions are appropriate  and particularly in the steam coal market  we enter into long term contracts exceeding one year in duration with many of our customers 
these arrangements allow customers to secure a supply for their future needs and may provide us with greater predictability of sales volume and sales prices 
a majority of our steam coal sales are shipped under long term contracts 
the terms of our contracts result from bidding and negotiations with customers 
consequently  the terms of these contracts typically vary significantly in many respects  including price adjustment and price reopener features  provisions permitting renegotiation or modification of coal sale prices  coal quality requirements  quantity parameters  flexibility and adjustment mechanisms  permitted sources of supply  treatment of environmental constraints  options to extend and force majeure  suspension  termination and assignment provisions  and provisions regarding the allocation between the parties of the cost of complying with future governmental regulations

our sales backlog  including backlog subject to price reopener and or extension provisions  was approximately million tons as of january  and approximately million tons for the comparable period in of these tons  approximately and  respectively  were expected to be filled within one year 
distribution we employ transportation specialists who negotiate freight and terminal agreements with various providers  including railroads  trucks  barge lines  and terminal facilities 
transportation specialists also coordinate with customers  mining facilities and transportation providers to establish shipping schedules that meet the customer s needs 
our produced and processed coal is loaded from our preparation plants  loadout facilities  and in certain cases directly from our mines 
the coal we purchase is loaded in some cases directly from mines and preparation plants operated by third parties or from an export terminal 
virtually all of our coal is transported from the mine to our preparation plants by truck or rail  and then from the preparation plant to the customer by means of railroads  trucks  barge lines  lake going and ocean going vessels from terminal facilities 
rail shipments constituted approximately of total shipments of coal volume produced and processed from our mines to the preparation plant to the customer in the balance was shipped from our preparation plants  loadout facilities or mines via truck 
in  approximately of our coal sales volume was delivered to our customers through transport on the great lakes and domestic rivers  approximately was moved through the norfolk southern export facility at norfolk  virginia  approximately was moved through the coal export terminal at newport news  virginia operated by dta  and approximately was moved through the export terminals at baltimore  maryland and new orleans  louisiana 
we own a interest in the coal export terminal at newport news  virginia operated by dta 
see other operations 
transportation coal consumed domestically is usually sold at the mine and transportation costs are normally borne by the purchaser 
export coal is usually sold at the loading port  with purchasers responsible for further transportation 
producers usually pay shipping costs from the mine to the port 
we depend upon rail  barge  trucking and other systems to deliver coal to markets 
in  our produced coal was transported from the mines and to the customer primarily by rail  with the main rail carriers being csx transportation  norfolk southern railway company  bnsf railway and union pacific railroad company 
the majority of our sales volume is shipped by rail  but a portion of our production is shipped by barge and truck 
we have positive relationships with rail carriers and barge companies due  in part  to our modern coal loading facilities and the experience of our transportation and logistics employees 
suppliers we incur substantial expenses per year to procure goods and services in support of our business activities in addition to capital expenditures 
principal goods and services include maintenance and repair parts and services  electricity  fuel  roof control and support items  fuel  explosives  tires  conveyance structure  ventilation supplies and lubricants 
we use suppliers for a significant portion of our equipment rebuilds and repairs both on and off site  as well as construction and reclamation activities and to support computer systems 

table of contents we have a centralized sourcing group  which sets sourcing policy and strategy focusing primarily on major supplier contract negotiation and administration  including but not limited to the purchase of major capital goods in support of the mining operations 
the supplier base has been relatively stable for many years  but there has been some consolidation 
we are not dependent on any one supplier 
we promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs while improving quality and service 
we seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise 
employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
as of december   the umwa represented approximately of our total employees 
our umwa represented employees are located in kentucky  virginia  west virginia and pennsylvania  and produced approximately of our coal sales volume during the fiscal year ended december  relations with organized labor are important to our success  and we believe our relations with our employees are very good 

table of contents environmental and other regulatory matters federal  state and local authorities regulate the united states coal mining and oil and gas industries with respect to matters such as employee health and safety  permitting and licensing requirements  emissions to air and discharges to water  plant and wildlife protection  the reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or other activity has been completed  the storage  treatment and disposal of wastes  remediation of contaminated soil  protection of surface and groundwater  surface subsidence from underground mining  the effects on surface and groundwater quality and availability  noise  dust and competing uses of adjacent  overlying or underlying lands such as for oil and gas activity  pipelines  roads and public facilities 
ordinances  regulations and legislation and judicial or agency interpretations thereof with respect to these matters have had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our production costs and our competitive position 
new laws and regulations  as well as future interpretations or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs and may cause delays  interruptions  or a termination of operations  the extent of which we cannot predict 
we intend to respond to these regulatory requirements and interpretations thereof at the appropriate time by implementing necessary modifications to facilities or operating procedures or plans 
when appropriate  we may also challenge actions in regulatory or court proceedings 
future legislation  regulations  interpretations or enforcement may also cause coal to become a less attractive fuel source for our customers due to factors such as investments in pollution control equipment necessary to meet new and more stringent air  water or solid waste requirements 
similarly  coal may become a less attractive fuel source for our customers if federal  state or local emissions rates or caps on greenhouse gases are enacted  or a tax on carbon is imposed  such as those that may result from climate change legislation or regulations 
as a result  future legislation  regulations  interpretations or enforcement may adversely affect our mining or other operations  or our cost structure or may adversely impact the ability or economic desire of our customers to use coal 
we endeavor to conduct our mining and other operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
however  due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations occur from time to time 
it is possible that future liability under or compliance with environmental and safety requirements could have a material effect on our operations or competitive position 
under some circumstances  substantial fines and penalties  including revocation or suspension of mining or other permits or plans  may be imposed under the laws described below 
monetary sanctions and  in severe circumstances  criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws 
mine safety and health the coal mine health and safety act of and the federal mine safety and health act of impose stringent safety and health standards on all aspects of mining operations 
also  the states in which we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement 
collectively  federal and state safety and health regulation in the coal mining industry is perhaps one of the most comprehensive and pervasive systems for protection of employee health and safety affecting any segment of us industry 
regulation has a significant effect on our operating costs 
in recent years  legislative and regulatory bodies at the state and federal levels  including msha  have promulgated or proposed various statutes  regulations and policies relating to mine safety and mine emergency issues 
the miner act passed in mandated mine rescue regulations  new and improved technologies and safety practices in the area of tracking and communication  and emergency response plans and equipment 
although some new laws  regulations and policies are in place  these legislative and regulatory efforts are still ongoing 
in april  msha published a final rule to revise the requirements for pre shift  supplemental  on shift and weekly examinations of underground coal mines 
the final rule adds a requirement that operators identify violations of mandatory health or safety standards and also requires the mine operator to record and correct these violations  note the actions taken to correct the conditions and review with mine examiners eg  the mine foreman  assistant mine foreman or other certified persons on a quarterly basis all citations and orders issued in areas where pre shift  supplemental  on shift and weekly examinations are required 
in january  msha published a final rule that implements changes to its pattern of violations pov program 
under the final changes  msha may issue a pov notice without first issuing a potential pov notice  and will consider all significant and substantial citations and orders issued  including non final citations and orders  when determining pov status  the final rule restates the statutory requirement that  for mines in pov status  each significant and substantial violation will result in a withdrawal order until a complete inspection finds no such violations 
in october  msha published a proposed rule to reduce the permissible concentration of respirable dust in underground coal mines from the current standard of milligrams per cubic meter of air to one milligram per cubic meter  mandate the use of continuous personal dust monitors  address extended work shifts  redefine normal production shifts  require additional medical surveillance examinations for miners  provide for the use of a single  full shift sample to determine compliance  and make various other changes to the existing respirable dust standard 

table of contents in august  msha published a proposed rule to require certain underground mining equipment to be equipped with proximity detection systems that will shut the equipment down if a person is too close to the equipment to avoid injuries where individuals are caught between equipment and blocks of unmined coal 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the full effect that new or more stringent safety and health requirements will have on our operating costs  but they will increase our costs and those of others in the industry 
some  but not all  of these additional costs may be passed on to customers 
black lung under the black lung benefits revenue act of and the black lung benefits reform act of  as amended in  each coal mine operator must secure payment of federal black lung benefits to claimants who are current and former employees to a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to eligible claimants 
the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on production of up to per ton for deep mined coal and up to per ton for surface mined coal  neither amount to exceed of the gross sales price 
in december  the department of labor amended regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to  among other things  establish a presumption in favor of a claimant treating physician and limit a coal operator ability to introduce medical evidence regarding the claimant medical condition 
due to these changes  the number of claimants who are awarded benefits has since increased  and will continue to increase  as will the amounts of those awards 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was implemented in  made two changes to the federal black lung benefits act 
first  it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least years in coal mines and suffer from totally disabling lung disease 
a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner work 
second  it changed the law so black lung benefits being received by miners automatically go to their dependent survivors  regardless of the cause of the miner death 
as of december   all of our payment obligations for federal black lung benefits to claimants entitled to such benefits are either fully secured by insurance coverage or paid from a tax exempt trust established for that purpose 
based on actuarial reports and required funding levels  from time to time we may have to supplement the trust to cover the anticipated liabilities going forward 
coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the coal act provides for the funding of health benefits for certain umwa retirees and their spouses or dependents 
the coal act established the combined benefit fund into which employers who are signatory operators are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries 
the combined benefit fund covers a fixed group of individuals who retired before july   and the average age of the retirees in this fund is over years of age 
premiums paid in and for our obligations to the combined benefit fund were approximately million and million  respectively 
the coal act also created a second benefit fund  the umwa benefit plan the plan  for miners who retired between july  and september   and whose former employers are no longer in business to provide them retiree medical benefits 
companies with plan liabilities also pay premiums into this plan 
premiums paid in and for our obligation to the plan were million and million  respectively 
these per beneficiary premiums for both the combined benefit fund and the plan are adjusted annually based on various criteria such as the number of beneficiaries and the anticipated health benefit costs 
on december   the tax relief and health care act of trhc became law 
the trhc seeks to reduce or eliminate the premium obligation of companies due to expanded transfers from the abandoned mine land fund aml 
to the extent these transfers are adequate  they have incrementally eliminated the unassigned beneficiary premium under the combined benefit fund effective october  the additional transfers will also reduce incrementally the pre funding and assigned beneficiary premium to cover the cost of beneficiaries for which no individual company is responsible orphans under the plan beginning january  for the first time  the benefit plan the plan all of the beneficiaries of which are orphans will begin receiving a subsidy from a new federal transfer that will ultimately cover the entire cost of the eligible population as of december  under the combined benefit fund  the plan and the plan  if the federal transfers are inadequate to cover the cost of the orphan component  the current or former signatories of the umwa wage agreement will remain liable for any shortfall 

table of contents environmental laws we and our customers are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws relating to the extraction  processing and use of coal  oil and natural gas 
some of the more material of these laws and issues  discussed below  place stringent requirements on our coal mining and other operations  others apply to the ability of our customers to use coal 
federal  state and local regulations also require regular monitoring of our mines and other facilities to ensure compliance with these many laws and regulations 
mining permits and necessary approvals numerous governmental permits  licenses or approvals are required for mining  oil and gas operations  and related operations 
when we apply for these permits and approvals  we may be required to present data to federal  state or local authorities pertaining to the effect or impact our operations may have upon the environment 
the requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of mining or other operations 
these requirements may also be supplemented  modified or re interpreted from time to time 
regulations also provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed  refused or revoked if an officer  director or a stockholder with a or greater interest in the entity is affiliated with or is in a position to control another entity that has outstanding mining permit violations 
thus  past or ongoing violations of federal and state mining laws could provide a basis to revoke existing permits and to deny the issuance of additional permits 
in order to obtain mining permits and approvals from state regulatory authorities  we must submit a reclamation plan for restoring  upon the completion of mining operations  the mined property to its prior or better condition  productive use or other permitted condition 
typically  we submit our necessary permit applications several months  or even years  before we plan to begin mining a new area or extend an existing area 
in the past  we have generally obtained our mining permits in time so as to be able to run our operations as planned 
however  we may experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits or other necessary approvals in the future  or even face denials of permits altogether 
in particular  issuance of army corps of engineers the coe permits in central appalachia allowing placement of material in valleys have been slowed in recent years due to ongoing disputes over the requirements for obtaining such permits 
these delays could spread to other geographic regions 
mountaintop removal mining is a legal but controversial method of surface mining 
certain anti mining special interest groups are waging a public relations assault upon this mining method and are encouraging the introduction of legislation at the state and federal level to restrict or ban it and to preclude purchasing coal mined by this method 
should changes in laws  regulations or availability of permits severely restrict or ban this mining method in the future  our production and associated profitability could be adversely impacted 
surface mining control and reclamation act the surface mining control and reclamation act of smcra  which is administered by the office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement within the department of the interior the osm  establishes mining  environmental protection and reclamation standards for all aspects of surface mining  as well as many aspects of deep mining that impact the surface 
where state regulatory agencies have adopted federal mining programs under smcra  the state becomes the regulatory authority with primacy and issues the permits  but the osm maintains oversight 
smcra stipulates compliance with many other major environmental statutes  including the federal clean air act  clean water act  resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund 
smcra permit provisions include requirements for  among other actions  coal prospecting  mine plan development  topsoil removal  storage and replacement  selective handling of overburden materials  mine pit backfilling and grading  protection of the hydrologic balance  mitigation plans  subsidence control for underground mines  surface drainage control  mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment  and re vegetation 
the permit application process is initiated by collecting baseline data to characterize adequately the pre mine environmental condition of the permit area 
this work includes surveys of cultural and historical resources  soils  vegetation  wildlife  assessment of surface and ground water hydrology  climatology  and wetlands 
in conducting this work  we collect geologic data to define and model the soil and rock structures and coal that we will mine 
we develop mining and reclamation plans by utilizing this geologic data and incorporating elements of the environmental data 
the mining and reclamation plan incorporates the provisions of smcra  the state programs  and the complementary environmental programs that affect coal mining 
also included in the permit application is information regarding ownership and agreements pertaining to coal  minerals  oil and gas  water rights  rights of way and surface land 
some smcra mine permits take over a year to prepare  depending on the size and complexity of the mine 
once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency  it goes through a completeness review and technical review 
proposed permits also undergo a public notice and comment period 
some smcra mine permits may take several years or 
table of contents even longer to be issued 
regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance and the public and other agencies have rights to comment on and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including through intervention in the courts 
before a smcra permit is issued  a mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of reclamation obligations 
the aml  which is part of smcra  requires a fee on all coal produced 
the proceeds are used to reclaim mine lands closed prior to when smcra came into effect 
the current fee is per ton on surface mined coal and on deep mined coal from to  with reductions to per ton on surface mined coal and per ton on deep mined coal from to in december  the osm issued revisions to its stream buffer zone rule under smcra 
the revisions allow disposal of excess spoil within feet of streams if the osm makes findings of impact minimization that overlap findings required by the coe in administration of the clean water act section permit program 
in a settlement agreement with environmental groups that filed legal challenges seeking to invalidate the rule  the osm agreed to issue a new proposed rule in and a final rule in in april  as initial steps toward issuing a new stream protection rule under smcra  the osm commenced a pre rulemaking information gathering process and solicited public comment on a notice of intent to conduct an environmental impact study 
the osm reports that the options under consideration for the new rule include requiring more extensive baseline data on hydrology  geology and aquatic biology in permit applications  specifically defining the material damage that would be prohibited outside permitted areas  requiring additional monitoring during mining and reclamation  establishing corrective action thresholds  and limiting variances and exceptions to the approximate original contour requirement for reclamation 
the osm has not yet issued the proposed rule 
in addition  legislation has been introduced in congress in the past and may be introduced in the future in an attempt to preclude placing any fill material in streams 
implementation of new requirements or enactment of such legislation would negatively impact our future ability to conduct certain types of mining activities 
surety bonds federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long term obligations including mine closure or reclamation costs  water treatment  federal and state workers compensation costs  obligations under federal coal leases and other miscellaneous obligations 
many of these bonds are renewable on a yearly basis 
we cannot predict our ability to obtain or the cost of bonds in the future 
greenhouse gas emissions impact initiatives one major by product of burning coal and all other fossil fuels is the release of carbon dioxide co  which is considered by the us environmental protection agency the epa as a greenhouse gas ghg 
co is perceived by some as a major source of concern with respect to global warming 
methane  which must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons  also is classified as a ghg 
although our gas operations capture some of the coalbed methane in several of our operations  most is vented into the atmosphere when the coal is mined 
considerable and increasing government attention in the united states and other countries is being paid to reducing ghg emissions  including co emissions from coal fired power plants and methane emissions from mining operations 
although the united states has not ratified the kyoto protocol to the united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc  which became effective for many countries in and establishes a binding set of emission targets for ghgs  the united states is actively participating in various international initiatives within and outside of the unfccc process to negotiate developed and developing nation commitments for ghg emission reductions and related financing 
in particular  the durban platform for enhanced action  as agreed to by the united states and other countries in december at the th unfccc  calls for a second phase of the kyoto protocol ghg emissions restrictions to be effective through and for a new international treaty to come into effect and be implemented from in december  the th unfccc in doha made further progress toward a new treaty 
any international ghg agreement in which the united states participates  if at all  could adversely affect the price and demand for coal in the united states 
in addition to possible future us treaty obligations  regulation of ghgs in the united states could occur pursuant to new or amended federal or state legislation  including but not limited to regulatory changes under the clean air act  state initiatives  or otherwise 
at the federal level  congress actively considered in the past  and may consider in the future  legislation that would establish a nationwide ghg emissions cap and trade or other market based program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
there are other types of legislative proposals that would promote clean energy that congress has also considered in the past  and is currently considering 
many of these proposals would tend to favor fuels that have a lower carbon content than coal  but such proposals also incent the construction and development of carbon capture and sequestration plants as well as 
table of contents other advanced coal technologies 
we cannot predict the financial impact of future ghg or clean energy legislation on our operations or our customers at this time 
the epa also is implementing plans to regulate ghg emissions 
the epa mandatory greenhouse gas reporting rule required power plants and other large sources of ghgs to file annual reports disclosing ghg emissions beginning in in july  the epa issued amendments that required underground coal mines and certain other source categories to file their first annual reports disclosing ghg emissions in  covering calendar year our facilities subject to the rule have begun reporting the required ghg data 
more generally  in december  the epa issued a final endangerment and cause or contribute findings for greenhouse gases under section a of the clean air act  wherein the epa concluded that ghgs endanger the public health and welfare 
in april  the epa issued  along with the department of transportation  a rule to regulate ghg emissions from new cars and trucks 
this rule took effect in january  and according to the epa  established ghg emissions as regulated pollutants under the clean air act 
as a consequence  and in conjunction with an epa final prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  certain new and modified emission sources must meet best available control technology for ghg emissions 
the epa has announced plans to begin issuing ghg performance standards for new and existing power plants and some other source categories 
in particular  in march the epa issued proposed regulations to establish ghg new source performance standards for new fossil fuel fired electric utility generating units  and a final rule is anticipated in federal legislation that would variously suspend or eliminate the epa regulatory authority over ghgs has been introduced in both the house and senate 
in addition to federal ghg regulations  several state and regional climate change initiatives are taking effect before federal action 
the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi  a regional ghg cap and trade program calling for a ten percent reduction of emissions by  has nine participating states in the northeast connecticut  delaware  maine  maryland  massachusetts  new hampshire  new york  rhode island  and vermont 
the rggi program has had numerous emission allowances auctions and entered its second three year control period in on december   the california air resources board carb issued a final rule approving a state wide ghg cap and trade program pursuant to the california global warming solutions act of that would reduce california ghg emissions to levels in yearly increments by in january  carb cap and trade program became effective for the electricity sector and certain other facility categories 
other ghg initiatives  including the western climate initiative and the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord  are in various stages of development 
also  numerous state public service commissions have revised or are revising air quality programs so as to limit ghg emissions  such as those of kansas  colorado  and texas 
considerable uncertainty is associated with these ghg emissions initiatives 
the content of new treaties or legislation is not yet determined and many of the new regulatory initiatives remain subject to review by the agencies or the courts 
in addition to the timing for implementing any new legislation  open issues include matters such as the applicable baseline of ghg emissions to be permitted  initial allocations of any emission allowances  required emissions reductions  availability of offsets to emissions such as planting trees or capturing methane emitted during mining  the extent to which additional states will adopt the programs  and whether they will be linked with programs in other states or countries 
predicting the economic effects of more stringent ghg emissions limitations is difficult given the various alternatives proposed and the complexities of the interactions between economic and environmental issues 
coal fired generators could switch to other fuels that generate less of these emissions  possibly reducing the construction of coal fired power plants or causing some users of our coal to switch to a lower co generating fuel  or more generally reducing the demand for coal fired electricity generation 
this could result in an indeterminate decrease in demand for coal nationally  and various mechanisms proposed to limit greenhouse gas emissions could impact the price of coal and the cost of coal fired generation 
the majority of our coal supply agreements contain provisions that allow a purchaser to terminate its contract if legislation is passed that either restricts the use or type of coal permissible at the purchaser plant or results in specified increases in the cost of coal or its use to comply with applicable ambient air quality standards 
in addition  if regulation of ghg emissions does not exempt the release of coalbed methane  we may have to curtail coal production  pay higher taxes  or incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines 
other clean air act regulations the federal clean air act and corresponding state laws that regulate the emissions of materials into the air affect coal mining operations both directly and indirectly 
direct impacts on coal mining and processing operations arise primarily from permitting requirements and or emission control requirements relating to particulate matter  such as fugitive dust  including 
table of contents regulation of fine particulate matter measuring micrometers in diameter or smaller 
however  new regulations on ghg emissions could also impact permit requirements 
our customers also are subject to extensive air emissions requirements  including those applicable to the air emissions of sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides  particulates  mercury and other compounds from coal fueled electricity generating plants and industrial facilities that burn coal 
these requirements are complex  lengthy and becoming increasingly stringent as new regulations or amendments to existing regulations are adopted 
in addition  legal challenges to regulations may impact their content and the timing of their implementation 
more stringent air emissions regulations in future years may increase the cost of producing and consuming coal and impact the demand for coal 
initially  we believe that such regulations will result in an upward pressure on the price of lower sulfur eastern coals  and more demand for western coals  as coal fired power plants continue to comply with the more stringent restrictions initially focused on sulfur dioxide emissions 
as utilities continue to invest the capital to add scrubbers and other devices to address emissions of nitrogen oxides  mercury and other hazardous air pollutants  demand for lower sulfur coals may drop 
however  we cannot predict these impacts with certainty 
some of the more material clean air act requirements that may directly or indirectly affect our operations include the following sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide 
the clean air act requires the epa to set standards  referred to as national ambient air quality standards naaqs  for certain pollutants 
areas that are not in compliance referred to as non attainment areas with these standards must take steps to reduce emissions levels 
in  epa established a new hour naaqs for sulfur dioxide so  and a new hour naaqs for nitrogen dioxide no 
under the clean air act  the new naaqs generally must be attained no later than five years after the epa designates an area as non attainment 
fine particulate matter 
the epa has established naaqs for both particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to microns pm  and fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to microns pm or fine particulate matter 
over the past decade  the epa has taken several steps to lower the naaqs for particulate matter  which is currently being implemented in a number of designated non attainment areas 
most recently  in december  the epa issued a final rule to reduce the annual pm standard  retaining the existing hour pm standard and the existing pm standards 
the final rule will trigger a new round of non attainment designations and ultimately regulation 
meeting the new pm standard also may require reductions of nitrogen oxide and so emissions 
acid rain 
title iv of the clean air act required a two phase reduction of so emissions by electric utilities 
phase ii became effective in and applies to all coal fired power plants generating greater than megawatts 
the affected electricity generators have sought to meet these requirements mainly by  among other compliance methods  switching to lower sulfur fuels  installing pollution control devices  reducing electricity generating levels or purchasing so emission allowances 
ozone 
the epa naaqs for ozone  as amended in  is being implemented in a number of designated non attainment areas 
in addition  the epa proposed a more stringent ozone naaqs in january  with the epa review of the updated science regarding ozone currently scheduled for completion in accordingly  emissions control requirements for new and expanded coal fired power plants and industrial boilers may continue to become more demanding in the years ahead 
clean air interstate rule cross state air pollution rule 
in  the epa issued its final clean air interstate rule cair for further reducing emissions of so and nitrogen oxides nox to deal with the interstate transport component of nonattainment with naaqs 
cair calls for texas and states bordering or east of the mississippi river  and the district of columbia  to cap their emission levels of so and nox through an allowance trading program or other system 
at full implementation  the epa projected that cair would cut regional so emissions by more than from the levels  and cut nox emissions by more than from levels 
in july  in response to the court order on cair  the epa issued a new rule to replace cair  called the cross state air pollution rule caspr 
caspr would require additional reductions of power plant emissions in eastern states by for so and for nox compared to levels  according to the epa 
as well  caspr would severely limit interstate emissions trading as a compliance option 
in december  a federal appellate court issued a stay of caspr pending judicial review 
during the stay  cair remained in effect 
in august  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia struck down caspr  finding that it required certain upwind states to reduce their emissions below their respective contributions to nonattainment and that it usurped states roles in implementing emission reduction strategies 
although the epa may appeal the matter to the united states supreme court  it is anticipated that the epa will implement cair  which remains in effect except in minnesota  where a stay applies  and will initiate a new rulemaking to establish more stringent standards 
cair or more stringent standards may ultimately require many coal fired sources to install additional pollution control equipment for nox and so mercury and air toxics standards 
in december  the epa issued the mercury and air toxics standards mats  which sets technology based emission limitation standards for mercury and other toxic air pollutants for coal and oil fired electric generating units with a capacity of megawatts mw or more 
existing units generally 
table of contents have up to four years to comply 
the mats is subject to a pending court challenge in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  and the epa has announced that it expects to act on petitions for reconsideration of certain aspects of the mats during the mats may ultimately require many coal fired sources to install additional pollution control equipment or to close 
regional haze 
under the epa regional haze rule designed to protect and to improve visibility at and around national parks  national wilderness areas and international parks  state implementation plans must either require designated facilities to install best available retrofit technology bart to reduce emissions that contribute to visibility problems or adopt an emissions trading program or other alternative program that provides greater reasonable progress towards improving visibility 
the regional haze program  which the epa first established in  primarily affects the construction of new coal fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas 
in may  the epa issued a final rule that would authorize use of the caspr trading programs in place of source specific bart for so and or nox emissions from power plants  enabling states to avoid further action under their regional haze implementation plans until although the status of the final rule is in doubt following the court decision overturning the caspr  we expect that emission reductions required under other rules will address many  but perhaps not all  of the emission reduction requirements of the regional haze rule 
clean water act the clean water act of cwa and corresponding state laws affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on the discharge of certain pollutants into water and on dredging and filling wetlands and streams 
the cwa establishes in stream water quality standards and treatment standards for wastewater discharge through the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes 
regular monitoring  as well as compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards  are preconditions for the issuance and renewal of npdes permits that govern the discharge of pollutants into water 
these requirements are complex  lengthy and becoming increasingly stringent as new regulations or amendments to existing regulations are adopted and the interpretation of longstanding regulations is changed 
in addition  legal challenges to regulations may impact their content and the timing of their implementation 
some of the more material cwa issues that may directly or indirectly affect our operations are discussed below 
section permitting permits under section of cwa permits are required to conduct dredging or filling activities in jurisdictional waters 
coal companies must secure permits for the purpose of creating water impoundments  refuse disposal enhancements  refuse slurry impoundments  valley fills or for conducting certain other mining activities 
jurisdictional waters typically include ephemeral  intermittent and perennial streams 
the united states supreme court ruled in rapanos v 
united states in that certain waters with tenuous connections to navigable waters might not be jurisdictional waters requiring permits 
the case did not involve disposal of mining overburden or coal processing refuse  but has implications for the mining industry 
subsequently  in december the coe and the epa issued a joint memorandum to provide guidance to the coe regions and coe districts implementing the jurisdictional standards imposed by the supreme court 
the guidance requires a case by case analysis of whether the area to be filled has a sufficient nexus to downstream navigable waters so as to require permits 
in april  the coe and the epa released draft  nonbinding guidance for public comment and announced their intent to subsequently issue a proposed rule 
review and implementation of this guidance by the coe field offices remains inconsistent  the extent to which decisions made pursuant to this guidance will be challenged remains an open question 
the coe issuance of permits is subject to the national environmental policy act nepa 
nepa requires that a federal agency must take a hard look at any activity that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment 
nepa allows an initial environmental assessment ea to be completed to determine if a project will have a significant impact on the environment 
if the ea reveals a significant impact  then the agency must prepare an environmental impact statement eis  a very lengthy data collection and review process 
to date  the coe has typically used the less detailed ea process to determine the impacts from impoundments  fills and other activities associated with coal mining  however  in some cases the full eis process is being required for mining projects 
in general  the preliminary findings show that these types of mining related activities will not have a significant effect on the environment  and as such a full eis is not required 
should a full eis be required for every permit  significant permitting delays could affect mining costs or cause operations not to be opened in the first instance  or to be idled or closed 
issues concerning permitting for fills have included the adequacy of the pre mining assessments of areas to be impacted required by the coe and conducted by the permit applicants  and the necessity at steep sloped areas of central appalachia to impound streams below their valley fills for the purpose of constructing sediment ponds  which both the coe and the epa have considered to be treatment systems excluded from the definition of waters of the united states to which the cwa applies 
in august  following a challenge to these practices  the united states district court for the southern district of west virginia upheld the coe issuance of a permit to the company highland mining subsidiary 
although it has prevailed in court  the coe is continuing to assess its protocol for evaluating the pre mining stream conditions  as well as 
table of contents procedures used in the measurement of the success of mitigation 
legislation also may be introduced at the state or federal level in order to override this decision by the court of appeals 
an outcome that prevents the placement of mining spoil or refuse into valleys could have a material adverse impact on our ability to maintain current operations and to permit new operations 
in february  the coe published a final notice reissuing nationwide permit nwp  which had previously been used to authorize valley fills in connection with mining operations 
availability of the nwp as reissued is limited to discharges with impacts not greater than a half acre of waters  including no more than linear feet of streambed 
the district engineer may waive the linear foot limit by making a written determination that the discharge will result in minimal individual and cumulative adverse effects 
the nwp also is not available for discharges associated with construction of valley fills  which are broadly defined as a fill structure that is typically constructed within valleys associated with steep  mountainous terrain  associated with surface coal mining activities 
the nwp as reissued is of limited value to our operations 
accordingly  most of our permits must be obtained on an individual  site specific basis  which increases the time and cost of the overall permitting process 
further  surface coal mine permitting has been impeded by the enhanced surface coal mining pending permit coordination procedures  issued by the epa and the coe on june  ecp  and guidance contained in a july memorandum entitled improving epa review of appalachian surface coal mining operations under the clean water act  national environmental policy act  and the environmental justice executive order detailed guidance  replacing interim guidance that was issued in april however  in two decisions in october and july  in response to a court challenge by the national mining association and by several states  the us district court for the district of columbia held that the epa acted outside the scope of its authority under the cwa when it instituted the ecp and issued the detailed guidance without undergoing the notice and comment rulemaking process 
although the ecp and detailed guidance are no longer in effect  any future application of procedures similar to ecp  such as may be enacted following notice and comment rulemaking  would have the potential to delay the issuance of permits for our coal mines  or to change the conditions or restrictions imposed in those permits 
in january  the epa vetoed a federal cwa permit held by another coal mining company for a surface mine in appalachia 
in explaining its position  the epa cited significant and irreversible damage to wildlife and fishery resources and severe degradation of water quality caused by mining pollution 
in march  the united states district court for the district of columbia found that the epa post issuance veto of a permit exceeded the epa authority under the clean water act 
the epa has appealed this decision to the united states court of appeals 
if the district court decision is ultimately overturned  this could be a further indication that other surface mining water permits could be subject to more substantial review in the future 
national pollutant discharge elimination system permits the cwa requires that all of our operations obtain npdes permits for discharges of water from all of our mining operations 
all npdes permits require regular monitoring and reporting of one or more parameters on all discharges from permitted outfalls 
additional parameters  including selenium  aluminum  total dissolved solids and conductivity  potentially could create requirements for treatment systems and higher costs to comply with permit conditions 
in particular  the epa  despite having its detailed guidance on conductivity invalidated by a federal court  continues to seek to require states to impose conductivity or total dissolved solids tds limits 
conductivity is a measure that reflects levels of various salts present in water 
although states have not yet begun applying conductivity or tds limits routinely  if the epa is successful in requiring such limits  in order to obtain new npdes permits and renewals for coal mining in appalachia  applicants will be required to perform an evaluation to determine if a reasonable potential exists that the proposed mining would cause a violation of water quality standards  including narrative standards 
the former epa administrator stated that these water quality standards may be difficult for most mining operations to meet 
additionally  the now overturned detailed guidance contained requirements for avoidance and minimization of environmental impacts  mitigation of mining impacts  consideration of the full range of potential impacts on the environment  human health  and communities  including low income or minority populations  and provision of meaningful opportunities for public participation in the permit process 
we have begun to address these issues in some of our current permitting actions  but there can be no guarantee that we will be able to meet any new standards with respect to our future permit applications or renewals 
when a water discharge occurs and one or more parameters are outside the approved limits permitted in an npdes permit  these exceedances of permit limits are self reported to the pertinent agency 
the agency may impose penalties for each such release in excess of permitted amounts 
if factors such as heavy rains or geologic conditions cause persistent releases in excess of amounts allowed under npdes permits  costs of compliance can be material  fines may be imposed  or operations may have to be idled until remedial actions are possible 
additionally  the cwa has citizen suit provisions which allow individuals or organized groups to file suit against permit holders or the epa or state agencies for failure to enforce all aspects of the cwa 
as discussed in note  legal proceedings mine water discharge suits  to the company consolidated financial statements  certain of the company subsidiaries have been and are subject to such proceedings 
there also have been renewed efforts by the federal and state agencies to examine the coal industry record of compliance with npdes permit limits 
this enhanced scrutiny resulted in an agreement by massey to pay a million penalty in for 
table of contents over  alleged npdes permit violations 
subsequently  a number of our operating subsidiaries have been subject to enforcement actions  and in some cases have entered into settlements 
see note to the company consolidated financial statements 
the cwa has specialized sections that address npdes permit conditions for discharges to waters in which state issued water quality standards are violated and where the quality exceeds the levels established by those standards 
for those waters where conditions violate state water quality standards  states or the epa are required to prepare a total maximum daily load tmdl by which new discharge limits are imposed on existing and future discharges in an effort to restore the water quality of the receiving streams 
likewise  when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required  states are required to adopt an anti degradation policy by which further degradation of the existing water quality is reviewed and possibly limited 
in the case of both the tmdl and anti degradation review  the limits in our npdes discharge permits could become more stringent  thereby potentially increasing our treatment costs and making it more difficult to obtain new surface mining permits 
new standards may also require us to install expensive water treatment facilities or otherwise modify mining practices and thereby substantially increase mining costs 
these increased costs may render some operations unprofitable 
other regulations on stream impacts federal and state laws and regulations can also impose measures to be taken to minimize and or avoid altogether stream impacts caused by both surface and underground mining 
temporary stream impacts from mining are not uncommon  but when such impacts occur there are procedures we follow to mitigate or remedy any such impacts 
these procedures have generally been effective and we work closely with applicable agencies to implement them 
our inability to mitigate or remedy any temporary stream impacts in the future  and the application of existing or new laws and regulations to disallow any stream impacts  could adversely affect our operating and financial results 
endangered species act the federal endangered species act and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction 
protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining mining permits and may include restrictions on timber harvesting  road building and other mining or agricultural activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats 
a number of species indigenous to our properties are protected under the endangered species act 
based on the species that have been identified to date and the current application of applicable laws and regulations  however  we do not believe there are any species protected under the endangered species act that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal from our properties in accordance with current mining plans 
resource conservation and recovery act rcra affects coal mining operations by establishing requirements for the treatment  storage  and disposal of hazardous wastes 
certain coal mine wastes  such as overburden and coal cleaning wastes  are exempted from hazardous waste management requirements 
at present  fossil fuel combustion wastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulation under rcra 
however  the failure in of an ash disposal dam in tennessee focused attention on this issue 
in may  the epa issued for public comment proposed regulations setting out two options for governing management and disposal of coal ash from coal fired power plants 
under the more stringent option  the epa would regulate coal ash as a special waste subject to rcra subtitle c hazardous waste standards when disposed in landfills or surface impoundments  which would be subject to stringent design  permitting  closure and corrective action requirements 
alternatively  coal ash would be regulated as non hazardous waste under rcra subtitle d  with national minimum criteria for disposal but no federal permitting or enforcement 
under both options  the epa would establish dam safety requirements to address the structural integrity of surface impoundments to prevent catastrophic releases 
we currently cannot predict whether these rules  once finalized  will have a significant impact on coal used by electricity generators 
federal and state superfund statutes superfund and similar state laws affect coal mining and hard rock operations by creating liability for investigation and remediation in response to releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
under superfund  joint and several liability may be imposed on waste generators  site owners or operators and others  regardless of fault 
in addition  mining operations may have reporting obligations under the emergency planning and community right to know act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act

table of contents item a 
risk factors investment in our common stock is subject to various risks  including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
the following sets forth factors related to our business  operations  financial position  or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss 
risks relating to our industry and the global economy a substantial or extended decline in coal prices would reduce our revenues and adversely impact our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
our results of operations are substantially dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal 
those prices depend upon factors beyond our control some of which are described in more detail in other risk factors below  including the demand for domestic and foreign coal  which depends significantly on the demand for electricity and steel  the price and availability of natural gas and other alternative fuels  competition from other suppliers of coal and other energy sources  the regulatory and tax environment for our industry and those of our customers  and the proximity to and availability  reliability and cost of transportation and port facilities 
sustained declines in coal prices in the united states or other countries would materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows  as well as the value of our coal reserves 
for example  because of lower prices for certain types of coal that we produce  in  we reduced or halted production at certain of our mines  and could further reduce our production in the future if coal prices decline further 
lower demand for steam coal by north american electric power generators would reduce our revenues and could further reduce the price of our steam coal 
steam coal accounted for approximately and of our coal sales volume during and  respectively 
the majority of our sales of steam coal were to us and canadian electric power generators 
that demand is affected primarily by the overall demand for electricity  which is in turn influenced by the global economy and the weather  among other factors for example  north america has experienced mild winters for the past two years  resulting in lower demand  the availability  quality and price of competing fuels  such as natural gas  nuclear fuel  oil and alternative energy sources such as hydroelectric power  which may change over time as a result of  among other things  technological developments  increasingly stringent environmental and other governmental regulations  including air emission standards for coal fired power plants  and higher than normal coal inventories at many utilities 
recently  to the extent economically feasible  many north american electric power generators have shifted from coal to natural gas fired power plants  and we expect that new power plants that are built will be fired by natural gas because they are cheaper to construct than coal fired plants and because natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel with plentiful supplies and low cost at the current time 
increasingly stringent regulations have also reduced the number of new power plants being built 
any further reduction in the amount of coal consumed by north american electric power generators would reduce the amount of steam coal that we sell and the price that we receive for it  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
lower demand for metallurgical coal by us and foreign steel producers would reduce our revenues and could further reduce the price of our metallurgical coal 
we produce metallurgical coal that is used in both the us and foreign steel industries 
metallurgical coal accounted for approximately and of our coal sales volume in and  respectively 
any deterioration in conditions in the us or the foreign steel industry  including the demand for steel and the continued financial viability of the industry  would reduce the demand for our metallurgical coal and could impact the collectability of our accounts receivable from us or foreign steel industry customers 
the demand for foreign produced steel both in foreign markets and in the us market is also dependent on factors such as tariff rates on steel 
in addition  the us steel industry increasingly relies on processes to make steel that do not use coke  such as electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes 
if this trend continues  the amount of metallurgical coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it could decrease  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely 
table of contents impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
lower demand for metallurgical coal in international markets would reduce the amount of metallurgical coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal  and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices 
we compete with numerous other coal producers in various regions of the united states for domestic and international sales 
we also compete in international markets against coal producers in other countries 
international demand for us coal exports also affects coal demand in the united states 
this competition may affect domestic and foreign coal prices and impact our ability to retain or attract coal customers 
for example  competitors using longwall mining technology in the illinois basin may  as a result of greater production efficiencies  be able to offer lower thermal coal prices compared to coal we produce in central appalachia 
in addition  if the currencies of our foreign competitors decline against the us dollar or against our customers currencies  those competitors may be able to offer lower prices to our customers 
in the past  high demand for coal and attractive pricing brought new investors to the coal industry  leading to the development of new mines and added production capacity 
subsequent overcapacity in the industry has contributed  and may continue to contribute  to lower coal prices 
in addition  lower coal prices set by our competitors may also put downward pressure on coal prices 
lower demand for us coal exports would reduce our foreign sales and could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations and could result in additional downward pressure on domestic coal prices 
coal exports accounted for approximately and of our coal sales volume in and  respectively 
in addition to the factors described above  demand for us coal exports is dependent upon a number of factors outside of our control  including currency exchange rates  ocean freight rates and port and shipping capacity 
for example  if the value of the us dollar were to rise against other currencies in the future  our coal would become relatively more expensive and less competitive in international markets  which could reduce our foreign sales and negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
in addition  if the amount of coal exported from the united states were to decline  this decline could cause competition among coal producers in the united states to intensify  potentially resulting in additional downward pressure on domestic coal prices 
economic downturns and disruptions in the global financial markets have had and could in future have a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal  on our sales  margins and profitability  and on our own ability to obtain financing 
in recent years  economic downturns and disruptions in the global financial markets have from time to time resulted in  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others  including real estate 
this occurred in particular in connection with the extreme market disruption in  as well as the recent concerns about the debt burden of certain eurozone countries and the overall stability of the euro 
these disruptions  and in particular the tightening of credit in financial markets  have from time to time adversely affected our customers ability to obtain financing for operations and resulted in a temporary decrease in demand  lower coal prices  the cancellation of some orders for our coal and the restructuring of agreements with some of our customers 
additionally  china is the world largest importer of coal and decreases in their demand could impact the prices we receive for our export shipments 
any prolonged global  national or regional economic recession or other similar events could have a material adverse effect on the demand for and price of coal  on our sales  margins and profitability  and on our own ability to obtain financing 
we are unable to predict the timing  duration and severity of any potential future disruptions in financial markets and potential future adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries and the impact these events may have on our operations and the industry in general 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
our largest customer during accounted for approximately of our total revenues  and sales to our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 
these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us as they have previously  or at all 
if these customers were to reduce their purchases of coal from us significantly or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements  our revenues and profitability could suffer materially 

table of contents we may not be able to extend our existing long term supply contracts or enter into new ones with customers  and our existing supply contracts may contain certain provisions that may reduce protection from short term coal price volatility  which could adversely affect the capability and profitability of our operations 
we sell a significant portion of our coal under long term coal supply agreements contracts with a term greater than months 
the execution of a satisfactory long term coal supply agreement is frequently the basis on which we undertake the development of coal reserves 
during  approximately and of our steam and metallurgical coal sales volume  respectively  was delivered pursuant to long term contracts 
as of january   of our planned shipments for were uncommitted 
we may not be able to enter into coal supply agreements to sell this production on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable to us as our existing agreements 
further  our long term contracts may sometimes prevent us from capitalizing on more favorable market prices 
when our current contracts with customers expire or are otherwise renegotiated  our customers may decide to purchase fewer tons of coal than in the past or on different terms  including pricing terms less favorable to us 
in large part as a result of increasing and frequently changing regulation  as described above  electric power generators are increasingly less willing to enter into long term coal supply contracts  instead purchasing higher percentages of coal under short term supply contracts 
this industry shift away from long term supply contracts could adversely affect us and the level of our revenues 
for example  few customers with a contractual obligation to purchase coal from us would increase the risk that we will not have a market for our production 
in addition  the prices we receive in the spot market may be less than the contractual price a customer is willing to pay for a committed supply 
spot market prices also tend to be more volatile than contractual prices  which could result in decreased revenues 
in addition  price adjustment  price reopener and other similar provisions in long term supply contracts may reduce the protection from short term coal price volatility that these contracts traditionally provide 
price reopener provisions are particularly common in international metallurgical coal sales contracts 
some of our coal supply contracts allow for the price to be renegotiated at periodic intervals 
generally  price reopener provisions require the parties to agree on a new price based on the prevailing market price  however  some contracts provide that the new price is set between a pre set floor and ceiling 
in some cases  failure of the parties to agree on a price under a price reopener provision can lead to termination of the contract or litigation  the outcome of which would be uncertain 
during periods of economic weakness  some of our customers may experience lower demand for their products and services and may be unwilling to take all of their contracted tonnage or request a lower price 
customers may make similar requests when market prices have dropped significantly  as has occurred recently 
any adjustment or renegotiation leading to a significantly lower contract price could result in decreased revenues 
accordingly  supply contracts with terms of one year or more may provide only limited protection during adverse market conditions 
our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness and financial health deteriorates 
our ability to receive payment for coal sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness and financial health of our customers 
our customer base is changing with deregulation  as utilities sell their power plants to their non regulated affiliates or third parties that may be less creditworthy  thereby increasing the risk we bear on payment default 
these new power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
furthermore  competition with other coal suppliers could force us to extend credit to customers and on terms that could increase the risk we bear on payment default 
in recent years  downturns in the economy and disruptions in the global financial markets have  from time to time  affected the creditworthiness of our customers and limited their liquidity and credit availability 
we also have coal supply contracts with energy trading and brokering companies under which those companies sell coal to end users 
these contracts involve an increased risk that we may not be able to collect payment if the creditworthiness of the trading or brokering company declines  as we typically do not have a direct contractual relationship with the end user 
customers in other countries may be subject to other pressures and uncertainties that may affect their ability to pay  including trade barriers  exchange controls and local economic and political conditions 
we derived and of our total revenues from coal sales made to customers outside the united states in and  respectively 

table of contents regulatory and legal risks we are subject to a number of lawsuits  including various lawsuits relating to the explosion at the upper big branch mine  which  depending on the outcome  could have adverse financial effects or cause reputational harm to us 
a number of legal actions are pending relating to past safety conditions at former massey mines  the april explosion at the upper big branch mine  which we refer to as the ubb explosion  and other related matters  including accusations of securities fraud 
although in december  we entered into a non prosecution agreement and settlement resolving a number of these matters see legal proceedings  a number of legal actions remain outstanding  and it is possible that other actions may be brought in the future 
in particular  we are subject to purported class actions that allege violations of the federal securities laws  derivative actions against current and former massey directors and officers and actions brought by certain of the families of the twenty nine miners that died in the ubb explosion and certain employees and contractors alleging injuries as a result of the ubb explosion 
in addition  several former massey employees have been convicted of or charged with federal criminal charges 
massey former officers  directors and employees may continue to be subject to future actions and claims 
under the merger agreement with massey  we agreed to leave in place and not modify provisions contained in the organizational documents of massey and its subsidiaries and certain related indemnification agreements that grant rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the massey acquisition and related rights to the advancement of expenses in favor of any current or former director  officer  employee or agent of massey 
the outcomes of these pending and potential cases and claims are uncertain 
depending on the outcome  these actions could have adverse financial effects or cause reputational harm to us 
we may not resolve these actions favorably  may agree to settle or may not be successful in implementing remedial safety measures that may be imposed as a result of some of these actions and or investigations 
climate change initiatives could significantly reduce the demand for coal and reduce the value of our coal and gas assets 
global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention  and the current administration has highlighted action to address climate change as a major priority of its second term 
there is concern in particular about the emissions of ghgs  such as carbon dioxide and methane 
combustion of fossil fuels like coal and gas results in the creation of carbon dioxide  which is currently emitted into the atmosphere by coal and gas end users  such as coal fired electric power generators 
as a result  there have been and are expected to be numerous ghg emissions initiatives that could reduce the demand for coal  including international action to extend the kyoto protocol through and to enact a new international treaty to take effect thereafter that would more aggressively reduce ghg emissions  various federal epa initiatives  including a formal finding under the clean air act that ghg emissions result in endangerment to public health and welfare  required annual reporting of ghg emissions  the final tailoring rule requiring certain large industrial facilities  including power plants  to obtain permits to emit  and to use best available control technology to curb emissions of  ghgs  and a march proposed rule to impose federal limits on ghg emissions from new power plants  state and regional climate change initiatives  such as the regional greenhouse gas initiative of eastern states and the western climate initiative  and recent and proposed legislation and regulation in various states  including california ghg cap and trade regulations  which took effect for the electricity sector on january  and have the objective of reducing state wide ghg emissions to levels by  litigation by various states and municipal entities seeking to have certain utilities  including some of our customers  reduce their emission of carbon dioxide  and climate change guidelines for investors and lenders for example  guidelines announced by three of wall street largest investment banks in february that require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of utility power plants  which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal fired plants 
considerable uncertainty is associated with these initiatives  as the content of proposed legislation and regulation is not yet determined and many of the new regulatory initiatives remain subject to governmental and judicial review 
given this uncertainty  the various alternatives proposed and the complex interactions between economic and environmental issues  it is difficult to predict the economic effects of these initiatives 

table of contents however  any regulatory controls on ghg emissions are likely to impose significant costs on many coal fired power plants and industrial boilers and could have the effect of making them unprofitable 
for example  if the epa current rule proposal on carbon dioxide emissions becomes final  the construction of new coal fired power plants may be economically unfeasible using currently available technology 
accordingly  some existing power generators are switching to other fuels that generate fewer emissions  some power plants have closed and others are scheduled to close  and fewer coal fired plants are being constructed  all of which reduce demand for coal and would reduce the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
in addition  regulatory controls on allowable emissions and the price of emissions allowances have a potentially significant impact on the demand for our coal based on its sulfur content 
we sell both higher sulfur and low sulfur coal 
more widespread installation by power generators of technology that reduces sulfur emissions may make high sulfur coal more competitive with our low sulfur coal 
decreases in the price of emissions allowances could have a similar effect 
significant increases in the price of emissions allowances could reduce the competitiveness of higher sulfur coal compared to low sulfur coal and possibly natural gas at power plants not equipped to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions 
any of these consequences could result in a decrease in revenues from some of our operations  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
other extensive environmental laws and regulations also could affect our customers  reduce the demand for coal and cause our sales to decline 
our customers operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations relating to the regulation of emissions and discharges  the storage  treatment and disposal of wastes  and other operational permits 
in particular  the clean air act and similar state and local laws extensively regulate the amount of sulfur dioxide  particulate matter  nitrogen oxides  mercury and other compounds emitted into the air from electric power plants  which are the largest end users of our coal 
a series of more stringent requirements may become effective in coming years  including implementation of the current and more stringent proposed ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides  particulate matter and ozone  implementation of the epa clean air interstate rule or a more stringent replacement rule to significantly reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in eastern states  implementation of the epa december mercury and air toxics standards  which impose stringent limits on emissions of mercury and other toxic air pollutants from electric power generators and are being phased in generally over four years  and more stringent epa regulations governing management and disposal of coal ash 
see item business environmental and other regulatory matters 
these environmental laws and regulations impose significant costs on our customers  which are increasing as their requirements become more stringent 
these costs make coal more expensive to use and make it a less attractive fuel source of energy for our customers 
accordingly  some existing power generators are switching to other fuels that generate fewer emissions  some power plants have closed and others are scheduled to close  and fewer coal fired plants are being constructed  all of which reduce demand for coal and would reduce the amount of coal that we sell and the prices that we receive for it  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely impacting our earnings and the value of our coal reserves 
the extensive regulation of the mining industry imposes significant costs on us  and future regulations or violations could increase those costs or limit our ability to produce coal 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local environmental  health and safety  transportation  labor and other laws and regulations relating to matters such as controls on emissions and discharges  the effects of operations on surface water and groundwater quality and availability  the storage  treatment and disposal of wastes  the remediation of contaminated soil  surface and groundwater  surface subsidence from underground mining  and employee health and safety  and benefits for current and retired coal miners 
these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly stringent 
for example 
table of contents federal and state agencies and citizen groups have increasingly focused on the amount of selenium and other constituents in our wastewater discharges  and over the past five years a number of our subsidiaries have entered into consent decrees and orders imposing penalties and requiring extensive efforts to study and reduce our discharges of selenium and other substances  msha and the state of west virginia have implemented or proposed changes to mine safety and health requirements to impose more stringent health and safety controls  enhance mine inspection and enforcement practices  increase sanctions  and expand monitoring and reporting  and as described above  more stringent regulation of ghg emissions is being considered that  if expanded to cover coal mining  could increase our costs  require additional controls  or compel us to limit our current operations  particularly at our underground coal mines 
in addition  these laws and regulations require us to obtain numerous governmental permits described in more detail below 
federal and state authorities also inspect our operations  and in response to the ubb explosion  federal and west virginia authorities conducted special inspections of coal mines 
we expect the heightened inspection intensity to continue 
we incur substantial costs to comply with the laws  regulations and permits that apply to our mining and other operations  and to address the outcome of inspections 
the required compliance and actions are often time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production 
in addition  due in part to the extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations of laws  regulations and permits occur at our operations from time to time and may result in significant costs to us to correct the violations  as well as substantial civil or criminal penalties and limitations or shutdowns of our operations 
for example  in december  we entered into a comprehensive settlement with msha in which we resolved various outstanding msha civil citations  violations and orders related to the ubb explosion and other matters for approximately million see legal proceedings 
for more information concerning certain violations that have occurred  see exhibit to this annual report on form k for the year ended december  msha and state regulators may also order temporarily close a mine in the event of certain violations of safety rules  accidents or imminent dangers 
in addition  regulators may order changes to mine plans or operations due to their interpretation or application of existing or new laws or regulations 
any required changes to mine plans or operations may result in temporary idling of production or addition of costs 
these factors have had and will continue to have a significant effect on our costs of production and competitive position  and as a result on our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
new laws and regulations  as well as future interpretations or different enforcement of existing laws and regulations  may have a similar or more significant impact on us  including delays  interruptions or a termination of operations 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in material liabilities to us 
our operations  including those of our acquired companies  currently use and have used in the past hazardous materials  and from time to time we generate and have generated in the past limited quantities of hazardous wastes 
we may be subject to claims under federal or state law for toxic torts  natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  sediments  groundwater and other natural resources 
for example  see item business environmental and other regulatory matters for a discussion of superfund and rcra matters 
such claims may arise out of current or former conditions at sites that we own or operate currently  as well as at sites that we and our acquired companies owned or operated in the past  and at contaminated sites that have always been owned or operated by third parties 
our liability for such claims may be joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages  or even for the entire share 
we maintain extensive coal slurry impoundments at a number of our mines 
these impoundments are subject to extensive regulation 
slurry impoundments maintained by other coal mining operations have been known to fail  causing extensive damage to the environment and natural resources  as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages 
some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas  which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of resulting damages 
if one of our impoundments were to fail  we could be subject to substantial claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability  as well as for fines and penalties 
the failure of the fly ash impoundment at the tennessee valley authority kingston power plant  although not regulated in the same manner as our slurry impoundments  could result in additional scrutiny of our impoundments 

table of contents these and other environmental impacts that our operations may have  as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations  could result in costs and liabilities that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unable to obtain and renew permits necessary for our operations  which would reduce our production  cash flows and profitability 
mining companies must obtain numerous regulatory permits that impose strict conditions on various environmental and safety matters in connection with coal mining 
the permitting rules are complex and change over time  potentially in ways that may make our ability to comply with the applicable requirements more difficult or impractical or even preclude the continuation of ongoing operations or the development of future mining operations 
the public  including special interest groups and individuals  have certain rights under various statutes to comment upon  submit objections to and otherwise engage in the permitting process  including bringing citizens lawsuits to challenge permits or mining activities 
in recent years  the permitting required for coal mining has been the subject of increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and extensive litigation by environmental groups 
as a result  the permitting process is costly and time consuming  required permits may not be issued or renewed in a timely fashion or at all  and permits that are issued may be conditioned in a manner that may restrict our ability to conduct our mining activities efficiently 
we may also be required under certain permits to provide authorities data on the impact on the environment of proposed exploration for or production of coal 
in particular  certain of our activities require a section dredge and fill permit from the army corps of engineers the coe 
in recent years  the section permitting process has been subject to increasingly stringent regulatory and administrative requirements and a series of court challenges  which have resulted in increased costs and delays in the permitting process 
the coe has taken action to restrict the availability of its nationwide permit  and the epa has announced a new rulemaking that would further address the circumstances when a section permit is needed 
increasingly stringent requirements governing coal mining also are being considered or implemented under the surface mining control and reclamation act  the national pollution discharge elimination system permit process  and various other environmental programs 
it is unclear what impact these and other developments may have on the types of conditions or restrictions that will be imposed on our future applications for surface coal mining permits and surface facilities at underground mines 
many of our permits are subject to renewal from time to time  and renewed permits may contain more restrictive conditions than our existing permits 
for example  many of our permits governing surface stream and groundwater discharges and impacts will be subject to new and more stringent conditions to address various new water quality requirements upon renewal over the next several years 
to obtain renewed permits  we may have to petition to have stream quality designations changed based on available data  and if we are unsuccessful  we may not be able to continue to operate the facility as planned or at all 
although we have no estimates at this time  our costs to satisfy these conditions could be substantial 
future changes or challenges to the permitting process could cause additional increases in the costs  time  and difficulty associated with obtaining and complying with the permits  and could delay or prevent commencing or continuing exploration or production operations  and as a result  adversely affect our coal production  cash flows and profitability 
any failure by third parties to fulfill their indemnification obligations to us could increase our liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
in the acquisition agreements entered into with the sellers of the companies that we have acquired including coastal coal company  nicewonder and progress  and agreements that companies we have acquired entered into prior to our acquisition of them  such as the distribution agreement entered into by massey and fluor as of november  in connection with the spin off of fluor by massey the distribution agreement  the respective sellers and  in some cases  their parent companies or other parties  agreed to retain responsibility for and indemnify alpha against damages resulting from certain third party claims or other liabilities  such as workers compensation liabilities  black lung liabilities  postretirement medical liabilities and certain environmental or mine safety liabilities 
the obligations of those other parties to indemnify us with respect to their retained liabilities will continue for a substantial period of time and in some cases indefinitely 
in other cases  the sellers indemnification obligations continue for a shorter period of time 
certain indemnification obligations are also subject to deductible amounts and do not cover damages in excess of the applicable coverage limit 
the assertion of third party claims after the expiration of the applicable indemnification period or in excess of the applicable coverage limit  or the failure of any seller or other applicable party to satisfy their obligations with respect to claims and retained liabilities covered by the applicable agreements or breaches of its representations and warranties could have an 
table of contents adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position if claimants successfully assert that we are liable for those claims and or retained liabilities 
recently  litigation has been commenced between fluor and the purchasers of fluor prior business regarding the purchasers obligation to indemnify fluor against claims and judgment arising out of that business 
to the extent the litigation results in a determination that fluor is not entitled to indemnification from the purchasers  fluor ability to satisfy all or some of its indemnification obligations with respect to alpha subsidiaries under the distribution agreement may be negatively affected 
see legal proceedings other legal proceedings 
changes in federal or state income tax laws  particularly in the area of percentage depletion  could cause our financial position and profitability to deteriorate 
the federal government has been reviewing the income tax laws relating to the coal industry regarding percentage depletion benefits 
if the percentage depletion tax benefit is reduced or eliminated  our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially impacted 
risks relating to our operations a decline in demand for metallurgical coal would limit our ability to sell our high quality steam coal as higher priced metallurgical coal  which would reduce our revenues and profitability  and could affect the economic viability of some of our mines with higher operating costs 
we are able to mine  process and market some of our coal reserves as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal 
in deciding our approach to these reserves  management assesses the conditions in the metallurgical and steam coal markets  including factors such as the current and anticipated future market prices of steam coal and metallurgical coal  the generally higher price of metallurgical coal as compared to steam coal  the lower volume of saleable tons that results when producing coal for sale in the metallurgical market rather than the steam market  the increased costs of producing metallurgical coal  the likelihood of being able to secure a longer term sales commitment for steam coal and our contractual commitments to deliver different types of coal to our customers 
a decline in demand for metallurgical coal relative to steam coal could cause us to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market  thereby reducing our revenues and profitability 
some of our mines operate profitably only if all or a portion of their production is sold as metallurgical coal to the steel market 
if all the production from these mines had to be sold as steam coal  those mines would not be economically viable and would likely need to be closed  which could lead to asset impairment charges and accelerated reclamation costs  as well as reduced revenue and profitability 
certain provisions in our long term supply contracts may result in economic penalties upon our failure to meet specifications 
coal supply agreements typically contain force majeure provisions allowing temporary suspension of performance by us or the customer during specified events beyond the control of the affected party 
following the ubb explosion  massey notified certain of its customers that it was declaring force majeure under certain of its sales contracts impacted by the lost tonnage resulting from the explosion and subsequent shutdown at the upper big branch mine 
it is possible that certain of these customers may ultimately challenge the declaration of force majeure or contest whether they received timely or proper allocations or amounts of coal following the declaration of force majeure 
in addition  most of our coal supply agreements contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal meeting quality thresholds for certain characteristics such as btu  sulfur content  ash content  grindability  moisture and ash fusion temperature 
failure to meet these specifications could result in economic penalties  including price adjustments  the rejection of deliveries or termination of the contracts 
further  some of our contracts allow our customers to terminate the contract in the event of regulatory changes that restrict the use or type of coal the customer may use at its facilities or increase the price of coal or the cost of using coal beyond specified limits 
as a result of these issues  we may not achieve the revenue or profit we expect to achieve from our long term sales commitments 

table of contents our coal mining production and delivery is subject to conditions and events beyond our control that could result in higher operating expenses and decreased production and sales  which would adversely affect our operating results and could result in impairments to our assets 
a majority of our coal mining operations are conducted in underground mines  with the balance at surface mines 
our coal production at these mines is subject to operating conditions and events beyond our control that could disrupt operations  affect production and the cost of mining for varying lengths of time and have a significant impact on our operating results 
adverse operating conditions and events that we have experienced in the past and may experience in the future include changes or variations in geologic conditions  such as the thickness of the coal deposits and the amount of rock embedded in or overlying the coal deposit  mining  processing and loading equipment failures and unexpected maintenance problems  limited availability or increased costs of mining  processing and loading equipment and parts and other materials from suppliers  the proximity to and availability  reliability and cost of transportation facilities  adverse weather and natural disasters  such as heavy snows  heavy rains and flooding or hurricanes  accidental mine water discharges  coal slurry releases and impoundment failures  unexpected mine safety accidents  including fires and explosions from methane and other sources  a shortage of skilled labor  strikes and other labor related interruptions  and the termination of material contracts by state or other governmental authorities 
if any of these or other conditions or events occur in the future at any of our mines or affect deliveries of our coal to customers  they may increase our cost of mining and delay or halt production or sales to our customers either permanently or for varying lengths of time  which would adversely affect our operating results and could result in impairments to our assets 
we maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where covered by insurance  these risks may not be fully covered and insurers may contest their obligations to make payments 
failures by insurers to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our ability to operate our company effectively could be impaired if we fail to attract and retain key personnel 
our ability to operate our business and implement our strategies depends in part on the efforts of our executive officers and other key employees 
in addition  our future success will depend on  among other factors  our ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business or business prospects 
mining in central and northern appalachia is more complex and involves more regulatory constraints than mining in other areas of the united states  which could affect our mining operations and cost structures in these areas 
the geological characteristics of northern and central appalachian coal reserves  such as depth of overburden and coal seam thickness  make them complex and costly to mine 
as mines become depleted  replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines 
in addition  compared to mines in the powder river basin  permitting  licensing and other environmental and regulatory requirements are more costly and time consuming to satisfy 
these factors could materially adversely affect the mining operations and cost structures of  and our customers ability to use coal produced by  our mines in northern and central appalachia 
due to our participation in multi employer pension plans  we may have exposure under those plans that extend beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees  and we may be required to make increased contributions due to plan underfunding status 
we contribute to a multi employer defined benefit pension plan administered by the umwa 
in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from a multi employee plan that is underfunded  we would be liable for a proportionate share of that plan unfunded vested benefits 
based on the information available from plan administrators  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability in the case of a full withdrawal or termination would be material to our financial position and results of operations 
if any other contributing employer withdraws from an underfunded plan  and that employer or any member in its controlled group cannot satisfy its obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other 
table of contents remaining contributing employers  would be liable for our proportionate share of the plan unfunded vested benefits  which would increase our liability in the case of withdrawal by contributing subsidiaries 
the pension protection act of ppa requires a minimum funding ratio of be maintained for a multi employer plan 
if the plan is determined to have a funding ratio of less than  it will be deemed to be seriously endangered  and if less than  it will be deemed to be critical  in either case  it will be subject to additional funding requirements 
in october  we received notice that the plan was considered to be in seriously endangered status for the july  plan year  and the plan was projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency by the plan year beginning july  in  a funding improvement plan was sent to all participating companies for adoption 
the goals of the funding improvement plan are to improve the funded status and to avoid an accumulated funding deficiency for all plan years in the funding improvement period 
the funding improvement plan provides increased contribution rates beginning in the plan funded status is reviewed annually by the certifying actuary 
if the funded status does not improve prior to the beginning of  the increase in contribution rates could be substantial  which could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our defined benefit pension plans are currently underfunded and we may have to make significant cash payments to the plans  reducing the cash available for our business 
we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the united states for certain salaried and non union hourly employees 
for these plans  the ppa generally establishes a funding target of of the present value of accrued benefits 
generally  a plan with a funding ratio below the prescribed target is subject to additional contributions requirements amortization of funding shortfalls 
furthermore  any plan with a funding ratio of less than will be deemed at risk and will be subject to even higher funding requirements 
in addition  the value of existing assets held in our pension trust is affected by changes in the economic environment 
the volatile financial markets in and caused investment income and the value of the investment assets held in our pension trust to decline 
as a result  depending on economic recovery and growth in the value of our invested assets  we may be required to make significant cash contributions into the pension trust in order to comply with the funding requirements of the ppa  which could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  we contributed million to our pension plans 
we currently expect to make contributions in for our defined benefit retirement plans up to million to maintain a funding ratio of at least 
as of december   our annual measurement date  our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by million 
these defined benefit pension plans are subject to the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
under erisa  the pension benefit guaranty corporation pbgc  has the authority to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under limited circumstances 
if our us defined benefit pension plans are terminated for any reason while the plans are underfunded  we may incur a liability to the pbgc that could exceed the entire amount of the underfunding  which could have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
expenditures for certain employee benefits could be materially higher than we have anticipated  which could increase our costs and adversely affect our financial results 
we are responsible for certain long term liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with active and inactive employees 
the unfunded status the excess of projected benefit obligation over plan assets of these obligations as of december   as reflected in note to our consolidated financial statements  included  million of postretirement obligations  million of defined benefit pension and supplemental employee retirement plan obligations  million of self insured workers compensation obligations and million of self insured black lung obligations 
these obligations have been estimated based on assumptions including actuarial estimates  discount rates  estimates of mine lives  expected returns on pension plan assets and changes in health care costs 
we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
in addition  future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs  which could also have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation laws from time to time  which  if enacted  could adversely affect us 
cybersecurity attacks  natural disasters and other similar crises or disruptions may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business may be impacted by disruptions such as cybersecurity attacks or failures  threats to physical security  and extreme weather conditions or other natural disasters 
these disruptions or any significant increases in energy prices that follow could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any of these occurrences  or a combination of them  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents federal healthcare legislation could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca was enacted  potentially impacting our costs of providing healthcare benefits to our eligible active and certain retired employees and workers compensation benefits related to occupational disease resulting from coal workers pneumoconiosis black lung disease 
the ppaca has both short term and long term implications on benefit plan standards 
implementation of this legislation is expected to extend through in the short term  our healthcare costs could increase due to  among other things  an increase in the maximum age for covered dependents to receive benefits  changes to benefits for occupational disease related illnesses  the elimination of lifetime dollar limits per covered individual and restrictions on annual dollar limits per covered individual 
in the long term  our healthcare costs could increase due to  among other things  an excise tax on high cost plans and the elimination of annual dollar limits per covered individual 
beginning in  the ppaca will impose a excise tax on employers to the extent that the value of their healthcare plan coverage exceeds certain dollar thresholds 
we anticipate that certain governmental agencies will provide additional regulations or interpretations concerning the application of this excise tax 
we will continue to evaluate the impact of the ppaca  including any new regulations or interpretations  in future periods 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals for reclamation and mine closure obligations prove to be inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as deep mining 
we accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities total million as of december   are based upon permit requirements and our historical experience  and depend on a number of variables  including the estimated future asset retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins of third party contractors  inflation rates and discount rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results and financial position could be adversely affected 
estimates of our economically recoverable coal reserves involve uncertainties  and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs  decreased profitability and asset impairments 
we base our estimates of our economically recoverable coal reserves on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff  including various engineers and geologists  and periodically reviewed by outside firms 
our estimates as to the quantity and quality of the coal in our reserves are updated annually to reflect production of coal from the reserves and new drilling  engineering or other data 
these estimates depend upon a variety of factors and assumptions  many of which involve uncertainties and factors beyond our control and may vary considerably from actual results  such as geological and mining conditions that may not be fully identified by available exploration data or that may differ from experience in current operations  historical production from the area compared with production from other similar producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation and taxes by governmental agencies  and assumptions about coal prices  operating costs  mining technology improvements  development costs and reclamation costs 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities and qualities attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of net cash flows expected from particular reserves prepared by different engineers or by the same engineers at different times may vary substantially 
in addition  actual coal tonnage recovered from identified reserve areas or properties and revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves may vary materially from estimates 
accordingly  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves 
any inaccuracy in our reserve estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs  decreased profitability and asset impairments 
defects in title in our mine properties could limit our ability to recover coal from these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs 
we conduct a significant part of our mining operations on properties that we lease 
title to most of our leased properties and mineral rights is not thoroughly verified until a permit to mine the property is obtained  and in some cases  title is not verified at all 
accordingly  actual or alleged defects in title or boundaries may exist  which may result in the loss of our right 
table of contents to mine on the property or in unanticipated costs to obtain leases or mining contracts to allow us to conduct our mining operations on the property  which could adversely affect our business and profitability 
in addition  from time to time  the rights of third parties for competing uses of adjacent  overlying or underlying lands  such as oil and gas activity  coalbed methane  pipelines  roads  easements and public facilities  may affect our ability to operate as planned if our title is not superior or arrangements cannot be negotiated 
furthermore  some leases require us to produce a minimum quantity of coal and pay minimum production royalties 
if those requirements are not met  the leasehold interest may terminate 
decreased availability or increased costs of key equipment and materials could impact our cost of production and decrease our profitability 
we depend on reliable supplies of mining equipment  replacement parts and materials such as explosives  diesel fuel  tires and magnetite 
the supplier base providing mining materials and equipment has been relatively consistent in recent years  although there continues to be consolidation  which has resulted in a limited number of suppliers for certain types of equipment and supplies 
any significant reduction in availability or increase in cost of any mining equipment or key supplies could adversely affect our operations and increase our costs  which could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
in addition  the prices we pay for these materials are strongly influenced by the global commodities market 
coal mines consume large quantities of commodities such as steel  copper  rubber products  explosives and diesel and other liquid fuels 
some materials  such as steel  are needed to comply with regulatory requirements 
a rapid or significant increase in the cost of these commodities could increase our mining costs because we have limited ability to negotiate lower prices  and in some cases  do not have a ready substitute 
disruptions in transportation services and increased transportation costs could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers and adversely affect our business 
in  of our produced and processed coal volume was transported from the load out or preparation plant to the customer by rail 
from time to time  we have experienced deterioration in the reliability of the service provided by rail carriers  which increased our internal coal handling costs 
if there is future deterioration in the rail transportation services we use and we are unable to find alternatives  our business could be adversely affected 
some of our operations are serviced by a single rail carrier 
due to the difficulty in arranging alternative transportation  these operations are particularly at risk to disruptions  capacity issues or other difficulties with that carrier transportation services  which could adversely impact our revenue and return on investment from these operations 
we also depend upon trucks  beltlines  ocean vessels and barges to deliver coal to our customers 
in addition  much of our eastern coal is transported from our mines to our loading facilities by trucks owned and operated by third parties 
disruption of any of these transportation services due to weather related problems  mechanical difficulties  strikes  lockouts  bottlenecks  terrorist attacks and other events could impair our ability to supply coal to our customers  resulting in decreased shipments and revenue 
disruption in shipment levels over longer periods of time could cause our customers to look to other sources for their coal needs  negatively affecting our revenues and profitability 
an increase in transportation costs could have an adverse effect on our ability to increase or to maintain production on a profit making basis and could therefore adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
because transportation costs represent a significant portion of the total cost of coal for our customers  increases in transportation costs could also reduce overall demand for coal or make our coal production less competitive than coal produced from other sources 
because we purchase coal to be blended and resold with coal that we produce  disruption in supplies of coal produced by third parties could impair our ability to fill customers orders or increase our costs 
we sold million tons of coal purchased from third parties during  representing approximately of our total coal sales volume during the majority of the coal that we purchase from third parties is blended with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  and we also process a portion of the coal that we purchase from third parties prior to resale 
the availability of the coal we purchase may decrease and prices may increase as a result of  among other things  changes in overall coal supply and demand levels  consolidation in the coal industry and new laws or regulations 
disruption in our supply of purchased coal could impair our ability to fill our customers orders or require us to pay higher prices to obtain the required coal from other sources 
any increase in the prices we pay for purchased coal could increase our costs and therefore lower our earnings 

table of contents our work force could become increasingly unionized in the future and our unionized or union free work force could strike  which could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability 
approximately of our coal production came from mines operated by union free employees  and approximately of our workforce is union free  as of december  however  under the national labor relations act  employees have the right at any time to form or affiliate with a union 
any further unionization of our employees or the employees of third party contractors who mine coal for us could adversely affect the stability of our production and reduce our profitability 
certain of our subsidiaries have wage agreements with the umwa or other unions that expire at various times 
certain of our idled operations have wage agreements that can be terminated either by us or the union with notice  which could be a risk if those operations become active in the future 
as is the case with our union free operations  the union represented employees could strike  which would disrupt our production  increase our costs and disrupt shipments of coal to our customers  and could result in the closure of affected mines  all of which could reduce our profitability 
past and future acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve a number of risks  any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our ability to grow depends in part on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions 
in the past five years  we have completed several significant acquisitions  including the massey acquisition  and several smaller acquisitions  joint ventures and investments 
our ability to complete these transactions is subject to the availability of attractive targets that can be successfully integrated into our existing business and that will provide us with complementary capabilities  products or services on terms acceptable to us  as well as general market conditions  among other things 
risks inherent in acquisition and other strategic transactions include uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities  of acquisition candidates  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies from an acquisition in the amounts and on the timeframe due to inaccurate assumptions underlying estimates of expected cost savings  the deterioration of general industry and business conditions  unanticipated legal  insurance and financial compliance costs  or other factors  the ability of management to manage successfully our exposure to pending and potential litigation and regulatory obligations  unanticipated increases in competition that limit our ability to expand our business or capitalize on expected business opportunities  including retaining current customers  and unanticipated changes in business  industry  market  or general economic conditions that differ from the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the acquisition 
the ultimate success of an acquisition or other strategic transaction will depend in part on our ability to continue to realize the anticipated synergies  business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired businesses with ours 
we may not be able to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties that we acquire 
problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business may involve coordinating management and personnel and managing different corporate cultures  applying our running right program at acquired mines and facilities  establishing  testing and maintaining effective internal control processes and systems of financial reporting to the acquired business  particularly in the case of private company acquisitions  the diversion of our management and our finance and accounting staff resources and time commitments  and the disruption of either our or the acquired company ongoing businesses  tax costs or inefficiencies  and inconsistencies in standards  information technology systems  procedures or policies 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated from a transaction  adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients  employees or other third parties or reduce our earnings 
moreover  any acquisition or other strategic transaction we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
future transactions could also result in our assuming more long term liabilities relative to the value of the acquired assets than we have assumed in our previous acquisitions 
further  acquisition accounting rules require changes in certain assumptions made subsequent to the measurement 
table of contents period as defined in current accounting standards  to be recorded in current period earnings  which could affect our results of operations 
we may incur additional goodwill impairment charges which may require us to record a significant charge to earnings 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we are required to assess our goodwill to determine if it is impaired on an annual basis and more frequently in the event of circumstances indicating potential impairment 
these circumstances could include a decline in our actual or expected future cash flows or income  a significant adverse change in the business climate or in our industry  or a decline in market capitalization  among others 
if our goodwill testing indicates that impairment has occurred  we are required to record a non cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and the implied fair value of the goodwill in the period the determination is made 
for example  we recorded impairment charges of  million during the year ended december  to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value for certain of our reporting units in eastern and western coal operations 
we continue to carry goodwill on our balance sheet  and it is possible that in future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for our goodwill 
these charges could be significant  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to develop or acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
our profitability depends substantially on our ability to mine in a cost effective manner coal reserves of the quality our customers need 
although we have coal reserves that we believe will support current production levels for more than years  we have not yet developed the mines for all our reserves 
we may not be able to mine all of our reserves as profitably as we do at our current operations 
in addition  in order to develop our reserves  we must receive various governmental permits 
as discussed above  some of these permits are becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive to obtain and the review process continues to lengthen 
we may be unable to obtain the necessary permits on terms that would permit us to operate profitably or at all 
because our reserves are depleted as we mine our coal  our future success and growth depend in part on our ability to acquire additional coal reserves that are economically recoverable 
our planned development projects and acquisition activities may not result in significant additional reserves  and we may not succeed in developing new mines or expanding existing mines beyond our existing reserves 
replacement reserves may not be available when required or  if available  may not be able to be mined at costs comparable to those of the depleting mines 
we may not be able to accurately assess the geological characteristics of any reserves that we now own or subsequently acquire  which may adversely affect our profitability and financial condition 
exhaustion of reserves at particular mines also may have an adverse effect on our operating results that is disproportionate to the percentage of overall production represented by those mines 
our ability to acquire other reserves in the future could be limited by restrictions under our existing or future debt agreements  competition from other coal companies for attractive properties or the lack of suitable acquisition candidates available on commercially reasonable terms  among other factors 
if we are unable to replace or increase our coal reserves on acceptable terms  our production and revenues will decline as our reserves are depleted  and our goodwill may become impaired 
disruptions in supplies of coal from mines operated by third party contractors could impair our ability to fill customers orders or increase our costs 
we use third party contractors to operate some of our mines 
operational difficulties at these mines  increased competition for contract miners from other coal producers and other factors beyond our control could affect the availability  pricing and quality of coal produced for us by contractors 
disruption in our supply of contractor produced coal could impair our ability to fill our customers orders or require us to pay higher prices obtain the required coal from other sources 
any increase in the prices we pay for contractor produced coal could increase our costs and therefore lower our earnings 
changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are not accounted for as a hedge could cause volatility in our earnings 
derivative financial instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
changes in fair value are recognized either in earnings or equity  depending on whether the transaction qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  and if so  how effective the derivatives are at offsetting price movements in the underlying exposure 
we account for some of our coal forward purchase and sales agreements as derivative instruments 
we also use enter into commodity swap and option agreements for a portion of our diesel fuel needs to reduce the risk that changes in the market price of diesel fuel can have on our operations 
some of these agreements have not been designated as qualifying cash flow hedges  so we are required 
table of contents to record changes in fair value of these derivative instruments in earnings 
these changes in fair value can have a significant non cash impact on our earnings from period to period 
our hedging activities for diesel fuel may prevent us from benefiting from price decreases 
we enter into hedging arrangements  primarily financial swap contracts  for a portion of our anticipated diesel fuel needs 
as of december   we had financial swap contracts with respect to approximately and of our calendar year and expected diesel fuel needs  respectively 
while our hedging strategy provides us protection in the event of price increases for diesel fuel  it may also prevent us from the benefits of price decreases 
if prices for diesel fuel decrease significantly below our swap prices  it could have a material effect on our financial condition  result of operations and cash flows 
we are also exposed to counterparty risk related to our swap counterparties 
risks relating to our liquidity our substantial indebtedness exposes us to various risks 
at december   we had  million of indebtedness outstanding before discounts applied for financial reporting  representing of our total capitalization  of which  million will mature in the next three years 
in addition  at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding under our credit facility and million of letters of credit outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization facility 
our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our business 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during adverse economic and industry conditions because any related decrease in revenues could cause us to not have sufficient cash flows from operations to make our scheduled debt payments  force us to seek additional capital  restructure or refinance our debts  or sell assets  cause us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities such as acquisition opportunities and to react to changes in market or industry conditions  cause us to use a portion of our cash flow from operations for debt service  reducing the availability of working capital and delaying or preventing investments  capital expenditures  research and development and other business activities  cause us to be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  expose us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under our credit facility  will be at variable rates of interest  make us more highly leveraged than some of our competitors  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage  limit our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes  and result in a downgrade in the credit rating of our indebtedness  which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness and result in more restrictive borrowing terms  including increased borrowing costs and more restrictive covenants  all of which could affect our internal cost of capital estimates and therefore impact operational and investment decisions 
our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at that time 
any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants  which could further restrict our business operations 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations  and the terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives 
our ability to make the required payments on our indebtedness is dependent on the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries  which may be constrained by legal  contractual  market or operating conditions from paying us dividends 
we will be dependent to a significant extent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make that cash available to us  by dividend  debt repayment or otherwise 
these subsidiaries may not be able to  or be permitted to  make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness 
each of these subsidiaries is a distinct legal entity and  under certain circumstances  legal and contractual restrictions  as well as the financial condition and operating requirements of our subsidiaries  may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries 
in the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries  we may be unable to make required payments of principal  premium  if any  and interest on our indebtedness 

table of contents we may incur more debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant indebtedness 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future under the terms of our credit facility and the indentures governing our debt securities 
our credit facility provides for a revolving line of credit of up to billion  with no borrowings outstanding as of december  the addition of new debt to our current debt levels could increase the related risks that we now face 
for example  the spread over the variable interest rate applicable to loans under our revolving line of credit is dependent on our leverage ratio  and it would increase if our leverage ratio increases 
additional drawings under our revolving line of credit could also limit the amount available for letters of credit in support of bonding obligations for our mines 
the terms of our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes limit our and our subsidiaries ability to take certain actions  which may limit our operating and financial flexibility and adversely affect our business 
our credit facilities and the indentures governing our notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  pay dividends  make redemptions and repurchases of certain capital stock  make loans and investments  create liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  and merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets 
these covenants could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute preferred business strategies 
in addition  complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies who are not subject to such restrictions 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in our being unable to comply with our covenants and payment obligations contained in our credit facility and the indentures governing our notes 
if we violate these covenants or obligations under any of these agreements and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders  our debt under all of these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by our lenders 
if our indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if we were able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our debt is in default for any reason  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
other covenants must be met for us to be able to access available capacity under our credit facility  including the maintenance of million of liquidity through the end of if we are unable to access undrawn capacity when we need it  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
certain terms of our convertible notes due and our convertible notes due may adversely impact our liquidity 
upon conversion of our convertible notes due and our convertible notes due  we will be required to make certain cash payments to holders of converted notes 
as a result  the conversion of the convertible notes may significantly reduce our liquidity  and we may not have sufficient funds to make these payments 
our failure to make these payments with respect to our convertible notes would cause a default under the relevant indentures and a cross default under our other indentures and our credit facility 
failure to maintain capacity for required letters of credit could limit our available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities  limit our ability to provide financial assurance for self insured obligations and negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditure or other general corporate requirements 
at december   we had million of letters of credit in place  of which million was outstanding under our credit facility and million was outstanding under our a r facility 
these outstanding letters of credit supported workers compensation bonds  coal mining reclamation obligations  umwa retiree health care obligations  and other miscellaneous obligations 
our credit facility provides for revolving commitments of up to billion  all of which can be used to issue letters of credit  and our accounts receivable securitization facility provides for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit 
obligations secured by letters of credit may increase in the future 
any such increase would limit our available borrowing capacity under our current or future credit facilities and could negatively impact our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements 
moreover  if we do not maintain sufficient borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility for additional letters of credit  we may be unable to provide financial assurance for our mining operations 

table of contents failure to obtain or renew surety bonds on acceptable terms or maintain self bonding status could affect our ability to secure reclamation and coal lease obligations  which could adversely affect our ability to mine or lease coal 
federal and state laws require us to obtain surety bonds to secure payment of certain long term obligations such as mine closure or reclamation costs  federal and state workers compensation costs  coal leases and other obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds  may demand less favorable terms upon renewal or may impose new or increased collateral requirements 
we also maintain self bonding in certain states  and the relevant state regulators may determine that we are no longer eligible for that status  which would require us to acquire additional surety bonds from third parties 
those events could result from a variety of factors including  without limitation a significant decline in our financial position or creditworthiness  the lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  restrictions on the availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the indentures governing our outstanding debt and under our credit agreements  the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew the surety or to require collateral for new or existing bonds  and a determination by state regulators that a change to our self bonding status is necessary to protect the state interests 
we have discussions from time to time  including recently  with state regulators regarding our self bonding status and with surety bond providers regarding our existing and current surety bonds 
in addition  if the financial markets experience the instability and volatility that they did in the recent past  our current surety bond providers may experience difficulties in providing new surety bonds to us  maintaining existing surety bonds  or satisfying liquidity requirements under existing surety bond contracts 
a failure to maintain our self bonding status  difficulty in acquiring surety bonds or additional collateral requirements would increase our costs and likely require greater use of our credit facility  a r facility or alternative sources of funding for this purpose  which would reduce our liquidity 
if we were to be unable to provide the financial assurance that is required by state and federal law to secure our reclamation and coal lease obligations  our ability to mine or lease coal and  as a result  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may be unable to repurchase our debt if we experience a change of control 
under certain circumstances  we will be required  under the terms of the indentures governing our various series of notes  to offer to purchase all of the outstanding notes of each series at either or  as the case may be  of their principal amount if we experience a change of control 
if a change of control were to occur  we may not have sufficient funds to purchase our various series of notes or any other securities that we would be required to offer to purchase 
we also might not be able to obtain additional financing to fund those purchases 
our failure to repurchase the notes upon a change of control would cause a default under the relevant indentures and a cross default under our other indentures and our credit facility 
a change of control as defined for purposes of our credit facility is also an event of default under the credit facility that would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of certain borrowings 
if that were to occur  we may not be able to replace our credit facility on terms equal to or more favorable than the current terms  or at all 
any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions as our existing indentures or credit facility 
risks relating to our common stock sales of additional shares of our common stock  the exercise or granting of additional equity securities or conversion of our convertible notes could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market and the availability of those shares for sale could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
in addition  future issuances of equity securities  including issuances pursuant to outstanding stock based awards under our long term incentive plans or the conversion of convertible notes  could dilute the interests of our existing stockholders and could cause the market price for our common stock to decline 
we may issue equity or equity lined securities in the future for a number of reasons  including to finance our operations and business strategy  adjust our ratio of debt to equity  satisfy claims or obligations or for other reasons 
the price of our common stock could also be affected by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that may exist or develop involving our common stock and our convertible notes 

table of contents we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid a cash dividend  and our board of directors periodically evaluates the initiation of dividends 
if we were to decide in the future to pay dividends  our ability to do so would be dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to make cash available to us  by dividend  debt repayment or otherwise 
our ability to pay dividends is limited by restrictions in our credit facility 
provisions in our organizational documents and the instruments governing our debt may discourage a takeover attempt even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impose impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire us even if a change of control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
for example  our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of unissued series of preferred stock  without any vote or action by our stockholders 
thus  our board of directors can authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting or conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting or other rights of holders of our common stock 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control of our company  and could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing our convertible notes occurs  holders of the convertible notes will have the right  at their option  either to convert their convertible notes or require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes 
in the event of a make whole fundamental change as defined in the indentures governing our convertible notes  we also may be required to increase the conversion rate applicable to any convertible notes surrendered for conversion 
if a change in control as defined in the indentures governing our senior notes occurs  holders of the senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their senior notes 
in addition  each indenture prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless  among other things  the surviving entity is a us entity that assumes our obligations under the applicable notes 
our credit facility imposes similar restrictions on us  including with respect to mergers or consolidations with other companies and the sale of substantially all of our assets 
these provisions could prevent or deter a third party from acquiring us even where the acquisition could be beneficial to our stockholders

item properties coal reserves reserves are defined by the securities and exchange commission sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
proven measured reserves are defined by sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
probable reserves are defined by sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal engineers  geologists and finance associates  as well as third party consultants we retained 
we periodically update our reserve estimates to reflect past coal production  new drilling information and other geological or mining data  and acquisitions or sales of coal properties 
coal tonnages are categorized according to coal quality  mining method  permit status  mineability and location relative to existing mines and infrastructure 
further scrutiny is applied using geological criteria and other factors related to profitable extraction of the coal 
these criteria include seam height  roof and floor conditions  yield and marketability 

table of contents since november  we have retained third party consultants to verify reserves for our major acquisitions  as well as to conduct ongoing reserve updates  on an annual basis  for specific properties that have undergone substantial modification to the reserve base 
properties that have undergone insignificant or no changes are carried forward without re evaluation 
these reviews include the preparation of reserve maps and the development of estimates by certified professional geologists based on data supplied by us and using standards accepted by government and industry  including the methodology outlined in us circular reserve estimates were developed using criteria to assure that the basic geologic characteristics of the reserve such as minimum coal thickness and wash recovery  interval between deep mineable seams and mineable area tonnage for economic extraction were in reasonable conformity with existing and recently completed operation capabilities on our properties 
we estimate that  as of december   we owned or leased total proven and probable coal reserves of approximately  million tons 
we believe that we have sufficient reserves to replace capacity from depleting mines for the foreseeable future and that our current reserves are one of our strengths 
we believe that the current level of production at our major mines is sustainable for the foreseeable future 
of the  million tons  approximately  million tons were assigned reserves that we expect to be mined in future operations 
approximately  million tons were unassigned reserves that we are holding for future development 
all of our reserves in wyoming are assigned 
approximately of our reserves are classified as high btu coal coal delivered with an average heat value of  btu per pound or greater 
approximately of our reserves have sulfur content of less than 
as with most coal producing companies that operate in appalachia  the great majority of our appalachian reserves are subject to leases from third party landowners 
these leases convey mining rights to the coal producer in exchange for a percentage of gross sales in the form of a royalty payment to the lessor  subject to minimum payments 
of our appalachian reserve holdings at december   million tons of reserves were owned and required no royalty or per ton payment to other parties 
our remaining appalachian reserve holdings at december   of  million tons were leased and require minimum royalty and or per ton payments 
our mines in wyoming are subject to federal coal leases that are administered by the us department of interior under the federal coal leasing amendment act of each lease requires diligent development of the lease within ten years of the lease award with a required coal extraction of of the reserves within that year period 
at the end of the year development period  the mines are required to maintain continuous operations  as defined in the applicable leasing regulations 
all of our federal leases are in full compliance with these regulations 
we pay to the federal government an annual rent of per acre and production royalties of of gross proceeds on surface mined coal 
effective october   the federal government remits of royalties  rentals and any lease bonus payments to the state of wyoming 
of our wyoming reserve holdings at december   million tons of reserves are owned and require no royalty or per ton payments 
our remaining wyoming reserve holdings at december   of million tons were leased and were subject to the terms described above 
our idled mine in illinois wabash is subject to coal leases and requires payments of minimum royalties  payable in periodic installments 
we expect to continue leasing these reserves until future development is feasible 
our reserve holdings attributable to wabash at december  were million tons 
although our coal leases have varying renewal terms and conditions  they generally last for the economic life of the reserves 
according to our current mine plans  any leased reserves assigned to a currently active operation will be mined during the tenure of the applicable lease 
because the great majority of our leased or owned properties and mineral rights are covered by detailed title abstracts prepared when the respective properties were acquired by predecessors in title to us and our current lessors  we generally do not thoroughly verify title to  or maintain title insurance policies on  our leased or owned properties and mineral rights

the reserve numbers set forth in the table exclude reserves for which we have leased our mining rights to third parties 
reserve information reflects a coal moisture factor on an as received basis  which means measuring coal in its natural state and not after it has dried in a laboratory setting 
we have measured all reserves on an as received basis 
this moisture factor on our delivered coal can vary depending on the quality of coal and the processing requirements 

table of contents assigned reserves represent recoverable coal reserves that can be mined without a significant capital expenditure for mine development  whereas unassigned reserves will require significant capital expenditures to mine the reserves 
almost all of our reserves that we currently market as metallurgical coal also possess quality characteristics that would enable us to market them as steam coal 
the wabash mine  an idled room and pillar operation  located in wabash county  illinois  has been on long term idled status since april idled facilities at wabash include a preparation plant and rail loading facility on the norfolk southern railway 
if conditions warrant  the mine could be re opened with less capital investment than would be required to develop a new underground mine

overview we are one of america s premier coal suppliers  ranked third largest among publicly traded us coal producers as measured by consolidated revenues of billion 
we are the nation s leading supplier and exporter of metallurgical coal for use in the steel making process and a major supplier of thermal coal to electric utilities and manufacturing industries across the country as well as a growing exporter of thermal coal 
as of december   we operate mines and coal preparation facilities in northern and central appalachia and the powder river basin  with approximately  employees 
we produce  process  and sell steam and metallurgical coal from mines and coal preparation facilities located throughout virginia  west virginia  kentucky  pennsylvania  and wyoming 
we also sell coal produced by others  the majority of which we process and or blend with coal produced from our mines prior to resale  providing us with a higher overall margin for the blended product than if we had sold the coals separately 
our sales of steam coal in  and accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume  and our sales of metallurgical coal in  and  which generally sells at a premium over steam coal  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our annual coal sales volume 
our sales of steam coal during  and were made primarily to large utilities and industrial customers throughout the united states  and our sales of metallurgical coal during  and were made primarily to steel companies in the northeastern and midwestern regions of the united states and in several countries in europe  asia  south america and africa 
approximately  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively  were derived from sales made to customers outside the united states  primarily in canada  india  the netherlands  south korea and turkey 
in addition  we generate other revenues from equipment and parts sales and repair  dry systems technologies equipment and filters  road construction  rentals  commissions  coal handling  terminal and processing fees  coal and environmental analysis fees  royalties and the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas 
we also record revenue for freight and handling charges incurred in delivering coal to certain customers  for which we are reimbursed by our customers 
as such  freight and handling revenues are offset by equivalent freight and handling costs and do not contribute to our profitability 
our primary expenses are for operating supply costs  repair and maintenance expenditures  cost of purchased coal  royalties  current wages and benefits  post employment benefits  freight and handling costs  and taxes incurred in selling our coal 
historically  our cost of coal sales per ton is lower for sales of our produced and processed coal than for sales of purchased coal that we do not process prior to resale 
we have two reportable segments  eastern coal operations and western coal operations 
eastern coal operations consists of our operations in northern and central appalachia  our coal brokerage activities and our road construction business 
western coal operations consists of two powder river basin mines in wyoming 
our all other category includes an idled underground 
table of contents mine in illinois  expenses associated with certain closed mines  dry systems technologies  revenues and royalties from the sale of coalbed methane and natural gas extraction  equipment sales and repair operations  terminal services  the leasing of mineral rights  general corporate overhead and corporate assets and liabilities 
business developments in addition to the massey acquisition completed on june   recent business developments included the following during the twelve months ended december   we announced the planned idling of certain mining operations and preparation plants in our eastern operations and other planned production curtailments as well as an organizational streamlining 
the mines impacted are located in virginia  west virginia  pennsylvania  kentucky and wyoming 
the combination of mine idlings  production curtailments and mining out of certain reserves will take place through early  and is expected to reduce production and shipments by approximately million to million tons compared to levels 
the majority of the reduction will come from higher cost thermal coal operations in the east and production curtailments in the power river basin 
these reductions will allow us to focus on higher margin products 
we will continue to evaluate market conditions and will make further adjustments if market conditions warrant 
our reorganization efforts will serve to reduce overhead while enhancing operational effectiveness as we align our structure to our smaller production footprint 
as part of our reorganization we established an operational performance group to support the deployment of best practices across the organization in areas such as operations improvement and preventive maintenance 
satellite offices in richmond  virginia  denver  colorado  latrobe  pennsylvania  and linthicum heights  maryland have been closed and overhead support functions are being consolidated from other locations as well 
we expect to achieve overhead savings from the streamlining of field and corporate support functions  which are expected to be reflected in lower cost of coal sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the twelve months ended december   we tested certain of our long lived assets and goodwill for impairment 
we recorded charges for asset impairment of  million and goodwill impairment of  million 
additionally  we recorded severance related expenses of million and million for professional fees 
additionally  we recorded other restructuring expenses of million related to reserves for advanced royalties and deposits which may not be recoverable and liabilities related to certain property leases that were terminated 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k related to asset impairment and restructuring expenses and goodwill impairment  respectively 
on october   we  certain of our wholly owned domestic subsidiaries  as guarantors  and union bank  na  as trustee  entered into a third supplemental indenture the third supplemental indenture to the indenture dated june  the base indenture and  together with the third supplemental indenture  the senior notes indenture 
the senior notes indenture governs alpha senior notes due the senior notes  which were issued on october  in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the senior notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually on april and october of each year  beginning on april   and will mature on april  additionally  in october   pursuant to a cash tender offer with respect to our convertible senior notes  we and alpha appalachia holdings  inc formerly massey repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding convertible senior notes using a portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the senior notes

coal pricing trends  uncertainties and outlook after a period of cyclical weakness in the global metallurgical coal market in the second half of during which approximately million tons of uneconomic production was removed from the seaborne market  developments are beginning to point to gradual improvement 
chinese coking coal imports increased for the full year compared to levels 
china purchasing managers index pmi has also been rising for several months 
recently  tropical storms have hampered activity at australian ports and disrupted rail shipments  although the impact is not as severe as the extreme weather events witnessed in early in the atlantic basin  european demand has been muted by economic headwinds  brazil slowed its importation of coking coal somewhat in  and us demand has been generally stable 
as a result  for the last several quarters  the atlantic market has been characterized by market weakness and over supply  particularly for lower quality metallurgical coals 
currently the atlantic basin remains disconnected from asia where the impact of production cuts and strengthening demand have begun to spark gradual improvement in the metallurgical coal market 
current spot transactions of australian metallurgical coal in asia have reportedly risen above the recent benchmark price  and are higher compared to levels experienced in september of as the leading us producer of metallurgical coal  alpha expects to be well positioned to 
table of contents benefit from an eventual recovery in the global metallurgical coal market  particularly in the atlantic 
throughout  the market for domestic steam coal remained challenging due in part to a warm winter  low natural gas prices and the long term secular trend of coal fired plant retirements  all of which contributed to reduced coal usage and led to record high inventory levels that peaked in the spring of as natural gas prices have increased from low levels experienced in the early part of  coal has recovered some of its market share that was lost with the low natural gas prices 
as a result of the increased usage of coal in the second half of the year  along with domestic production cuts during  utility inventories have started to retreat but remain elevated as of the end of the year 
the energy information administration eia annual energy outlook early release forecasts that coal fired electrical generation will decrease by an average annual rate of through the eia estimates that electric power generation from coal decreased by in compared to as low natural gas prices  increased environmental regulation  and other factors weighed on coal fired generation 
based on weekly coal production reporting through december  from the eia  year over year appalachian production decreased by approximately and western coal production decreased by approximately during in light of the continuing weakness in the us steam coal market  alpha adjusted its shipment levels and implemented a restructuring plan to adjust its operating footprint 
with respect to the powder river basin  alpha has reduced its planned shipments in the near term until elevated inventories eventually correct  allowing acceptable profit levels 
in the east  alpha pittsburgh seam longwalls  with high heat content and relatively lower costs  are expected to be competitive and productive in in central appalachia  alpha has idled or closed a number of higher production cost steam coal operations in order to control costs and match supply with structurally diminished demand that has decreased markedly over the course of at the same time  alpha more than doubled its eastern thermal coal exports in to nearly six million tons  and the company plans to continue to expand its export thermal franchise in  and beyond 
our results of operations are dependent upon the prices we obtain for our coal as well as our ability to improve productivity and control costs 
principal goods and services we use in our operations include maintenance and repair parts and services  electricity  fuel  roof control and support items  explosives  tires  conveyance structure  ventilation supplies  and lubricants 
our management strives to aggressively control costs and improve operating performance to mitigate external cost pressures 
we have experienced volatility in operating costs related to fuel  explosives  steel  tires  contract services  and healthcare  and have taken measures to mitigate the increases in these costs at all operations 
we have a centralized sourcing group for major supplier contract negotiation and administration  for the negotiation and purchase of major capital goods  and to support the business units 
the supplier base has been relatively stable for many years  but there has been some consolidation 
we are not dependent on any one supplier in any region 
we promote competition between suppliers and seek to develop relationships with suppliers that focus on lowering our costs 
we seek suppliers who identify and concentrate on implementing continuous improvement opportunities within their area of expertise 
to the extent upward pressure on costs exceeds our ability to realize sales increases  or if we experience unanticipated operating or transportation difficulties  our operating margins would be negatively impacted 
employee labor costs have historically increased primarily due to the demands associated with attracting and retaining a workforce  however  recent stability in the marketplace has helped ease this situation 
we may also experience difficult geologic conditions  delays in obtaining permits  labor shortages  unforeseen equipment problems  and unexpected shortages of critical materials such as tires  fuel and explosives that may result in adverse cost increases and limit our ability to produce at forecasted levels

table of contents segment analysis the price of coal is influenced by many factors that vary by region 
such factors include  but are not limited to coal quality  which includes energy heat content  sulfur  ash  volatile matter and moisture content  transportation costs  regional supply and demand  available competitive fuel sources such as natural gas  nuclear or hydro  and production costs  which vary by mine type  available technology and equipment utilization  productivity  geological conditions  and mine operating expenses 
the energy content or heat value of coal is a significant factor influencing coal prices as higher energy coal is more desirable to consumers and typically commands a higher price in the market 
the heat value of coal is commonly measured in british thermal units or the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit 
coal from the eastern and midwest regions of the united states tends to have a higher heat value than coal found in the western united states 
powder river basin coal  with its lower energy content  lower production cost and often greater distance to travel to the consumer  typically sells at a lower price than northern and central appalachian coal that has higher energy content and is often located closer to the end user

the spe is consolidated into our financial statements  and therefore the purchase and sale of trade receivables by the spe from our operating and sales receivables has no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the assets of the spe  however  are not available to the creditors of us or any other subsidiary 
the spe pays facility fees  program fees and letter of credit fees based on amounts of outstanding letters of credit  as defined in the definitive agreements for the a r facility 
available borrowing capacity is based on the amount of eligible accounts receivable as defined under the terms of the definitive agreements for the a r facility and varies over time

any acceleration under either the credit agreement or one of the indentures governing our notes would also result in a default under the other indentures governing our notes 
additionally  under the credit agreement and the indentures governing our notes our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda

ebitda is not a financial measure recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles and does not purport to be an alternative to net income as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
the amounts shown for ebitda as

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements 
these arrangements include guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
however  the underlying obligations that they secure  such as asset retirement obligations  self insured workers compensation liabilities  royalty obligations and certain retiree medical obligations  are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
we are required to provide financial assurance in order to perform the post mining reclamation required by our mining permits  pay our federal production royalties  pay workers compensation claims under self insured workers compensation laws in various states  pay federal black lung benefits  pay retiree health care benefits to certain retired umwa employees and perform certain other obligations 
in order to provide the required financial assurance  we generally use surety bonds and self bonding for post mining reclamation and bank letters of credit for self insured workers compensation obligations and umwa retiree health care obligations 
federal black lung benefits are paid from a dedicated trust fund to which future contributions will be required 
bank letters of credit are also used to collateralize a portion of the surety bonds 
we had outstanding surety bonds with a total face amount of million as of december  to secure various obligations and commitments 
in addition  we had million of letters of credit in place  of which million was outstanding under the credit agreement  and million was outstanding under our a r facility 
these outstanding letters of credit served as collateral for workers compensation bonds  reclamation surety bonds  secured umwa retiree health care obligations  secured workers compensation obligations and other miscellaneous obligations 
we meet frequently with our surety providers and have had discussions with certain providers regarding the extent of and the terms of their participation in the program 
these discussions may cause us to shift surety bonds between providers or to alter the terms of their participation in our program 
in the event that our self bonding capacity or additional surety bonds become unavailable or our surety bond providers require additional collateral  we would seek to secure our obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral  which would likely require greater use of our credit facility and a r facility for this purpose 
a failure to maintain our self bonding status  an inability to acquire surety bonds or additional collateral requirements could result from a variety of factors  including a significant decline in our financial position or creditworthiness  and restrictions on the availability of collateral under our credit agreements and indentures 
other as a regular part of our business  we review opportunities for  and engage in discussions and negotiations concerning  the acquisition of coal mining assets and interests in coal mining companies  and acquisitions or dispositions of  or combinations with  coal mining companies 
when we believe that these opportunities are consistent with our strategic plans and our acquisition or disposition criteria  we will make bids or proposals and or enter into letters of intent and other similar agreements 
these bids or proposals  which may be binding or nonbinding  are customarily subject to a variety of conditions and usually permit us to terminate the discussions and any related agreement if  among other things  we are not satisfied with the results of our due diligence investigation 
any acquisition opportunities we pursue could materially affect our liquidity and capital resources and may require us to incur indebtedness  seek equity capital or both 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all

the table below reflects the estimated undiscounted cash flows for these obligations in thousands after total asset retirement obligation postretirement benefit obligation pension benefit obligation black lung benefit obligation workers compensation benefit obligation total we currently expect to make contributions in of up to million for our defined benefit pension plans 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows will be paid from the defined benefit pension plan assets held within the defined benefit pension plan trust 
in addition  the estimated undiscounted cash flows disclosed above include cash flows related to our supplemental executive retirement plans  which are paid directly by us  and are million in  million in to  million in to and million thereafter 
we expect to spend between million and million on capital expenditures during this amount includes the remaining portion of the company s commitment to invest million for mine safety  which is approximately million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
gaap requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  
table of contents liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors and assumptions  including the current economic environment that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and adjust such estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances require 
illiquid credit markets  foreign currency and energy markets  and declines in demand for steel products have combined to increase the uncertainty inherent in such estimates and assumptions 
as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods 
derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
we are subject to the risk of price volatility for certain of the materials and supplies used in production  such as diesel fuel and explosives and for the amount we receive for the sale of natural gas 
as a part of our risk management strategy  we enter into options and pay fixed  receive variable and pay variable  receive fixed swap agreements with financial institutions to mitigate the risk of price volatility for both diesel fuel and explosives and sales of natural gas  respectively 
options and swap agreements are derivative instruments that we are required to recognize as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting requirements for derivatives are complex and judgment is required in certain areas such as cash flow hedge accounting and hedge effectiveness testing 
we assess each option or swap agreement to determine whether or not it qualifies for special cash flow hedge accounting 
in performing the assessment  we make estimates and assumptions about the timing and amounts of future cash flows related to the forecasted purchases of diesel fuel and explosives and sales of natural gas 
we update our assessments at least on a quarterly basis 
reclamation 
our asset retirement obligations arise from the federal surface mining control and reclamation act of and similar state statutes  which require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
significant reclamation activities include reclaiming refuse and slurry ponds  reclaiming the pit and support acreage at surface mines  sealing portals at deep mines and the treatment of water 
we determine the future cash flows necessary to satisfy our reclamation obligations on a mine by mine basis based upon current permit requirements and various estimates and assumptions  including estimates of disturbed acreage  cost estimates  and assumptions regarding productivity 
we are also faced with increasingly stringent environmental regulation  much of which is beyond our control  which could increase our costs and materially increase our asset retirement obligations 
estimates of disturbed acreage are determined based on approved mining plans and related engineering data 
cost estimates are based upon third party costs 
productivity assumptions are based on historical experience with the equipment that is expected to be utilized in the reclamation activities 
our asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value 
in order to determine fair value  we use assumptions including a discount rate and third party margin 
each is discussed further below discount rate 
asset retirement obligations are initially recorded at fair value 
we utilize discounted cash flow techniques to estimate the fair value of our obligations 
we base our discount rate on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to expected mine lives  adjusted for our credit standing 
third party margin 
the measurement of an obligation is based upon the amount a third party would demand to perform the obligation 
because we plan to perform a significant amount of the reclamation activities with internal resources  a third party margin was added to the estimated costs of these activities 
this margin was estimated based upon our historical experience with contractors performing similar types of reclamation activities 
the inclusion of this margin will result in a recorded obligation that is greater than our estimates of our cost to perform the reclamation activities 
if our cost estimates are accurate  the excess of the recorded obligation over the cost incurred to perform the work will be recorded as a gain at the time that reclamation work is completed 
on at least an annual basis  we review our entire reclamation liability and make necessary adjustments for permit changes as granted by state authorities  additional costs resulting from accelerated mine closures  and revisions to cost estimates and productivity assumptions  to reflect current experience and updated plans 
at december   we had recorded asset retirement obligation liabilities of million  including amounts reported as current 
while the precise amount of these future costs cannot be determined with certainty  as of december   we estimate that the aggregate undiscounted cost of final mine closures is approximately billion 
coal reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of economically recoverable coal reserves  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled by our internal engineers and geologists and reviewed by a third party consultant 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include 
table of contents geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
variances could affect our projected future revenues and expenditures  as well as the valuation of coal reserves and depletion rates 
at december   we had  million tons of proven and probable coal reserves  of which  million tons were assigned to our active operations and  million tons were unassigned 
postretirement medical benefits 
we have long term liabilities for postretirement medical benefit cost obligations 
detailed information related to these liabilities is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
liabilities for postretirement medical benefit costs are not funded 
the liability is actuarially determined  and we use various actuarial assumptions  including a discount rate and future health care cost trends  to estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement medical benefit costs 
the discount rates used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for postretirement medical benefits ranged from to for the year ended december  at december   we had total postretirement medical benefit obligations of  million  including amounts reported as current 
the estimated impact of changes to the healthcare cost trend rate and discount rate is as follows health care cost trend rate one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation discount rate one half percentage point increase one half percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation retirement plans 
we have three non contributory defined benefit retirement plans the pension plans covering certain of our salaried and non union hourly employees  all of which are frozen to new participants 
we also have two unfunded non qualified supplemental executive retirement plans serps covering certain eligible employees 
benefits are based on either the employee s compensation prior to retirement or stated amounts for each year of service with us 
funding of the defined benefit retirement plans is in accordance with the requirements of erisa  and our contributions can be deducted for federal income tax purposes 
we contributed million to our defined benefit retirement plans for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded a net periodic benefit credit of million for our pension plans and serps and have recorded net obligations of million 
the calculation of the net periodic benefit expense and projected benefit obligation associated with our pension plans and serps requires the use of a number of assumptions that we deem to be critical accounting estimates 
these assumptions are used by our independent actuaries to make the underlying calculations 
changes in these assumptions can result in different net periodic benefit expense and liability amounts  and actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is an assumption of the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
we establish the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon historical returns and projected returns on the underlying mix of invested assets 
the pension plans investment targets are equity funds and fixed income funds 
investments are rebalanced on a periodic basis 
table of contents to stay within these targeted guidelines 
the long term rate of return assumption used to determine net periodic benefit expense was for the year ended december  the long term rate of return assumption to be used in is expected to be 
any difference between the actual experience and the assumed experience is deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and amortized into expense in future periods 
the discount rate represents our estimate of the interest rate at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
assumed discount rates are used in the measurement of the projected  accumulated and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of the net periodic benefit expense 
in estimating that rate  we use rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the discount rates used to determine pension expense ranged from to for the year ended december  the differences resulting from actual versus assumed discount rates are amortized into pension expense over the remaining average life of the active plan participants 
a one half percentage point increase in the discount rate would increase the net periodic pension cost for the year ended december  by approximately million and decrease the projected benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million 
the corresponding effects of a one half of one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would decrease the net periodic pension cost for the year ended december  by approximately million and increase the projected benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million 
workers compensation 
workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain personal injuries due to job related accidents are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer fatal injuries receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee who is injured in the course of employment 
our obligations are covered through a combination of a self insurance program and third party insurance policies 
we accrue for any self insured liability by recognizing costs when it is probable that a covered liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
our estimates of these costs are adjusted based upon actuarial studies 
actual losses may differ from these estimates  which could increase or decrease our costs 
at december   we had workers compensation obligations of million 
coal workers pneumoconiosis 
we are required by federal and state statutes to provide benefits to employees for awards related to coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
certain of our subsidiaries are insured for workers compensation and black lung obligations by a third party insurance provider 
certain subsidiaries in west virginia are self insured for workers compensation and state black lung obligations 
certain other subsidiaries are self insured for black lung benefits and fund benefit payments through a section c tax exempt trust fund 
provisions are made for estimated benefits based on annual evaluations prepared by independent actuaries 
in addition  for our subsidiaries in wyoming  we participate in a compulsory state run fund 
charges are made to operations for self insured black lung claims  as determined by an independent actuary at the present value of the actuarially computed liability for such benefits over the employee s applicable term of service 
as of december   we had black lung obligations of million  which are net of assets of million that are held in a tax exempt trust fund 
business combinations 
we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting 
the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying identifiable net tangible and intangible assets based on their respective estimated fair values 
determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management s judgment  the utilization of independent valuation experts and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows  discount rates  market prices and asset lives  among other items 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we analyze both positive and negative evidence 
such evidence includes objective evidence obtained from our historical earnings  future sales commitments  outlooks on the coal industry by us and third parties  expected level of future earnings with sensitivities on expectations considered  timing of temporary difference reversals  ability or inability to meet forecasted earnings  unsettled industry circumstances  ability to utilize net operating losses  available tax planning strategies  limitations on deductibility of temporary differences  and the impact the alternative minimum tax has on utilization of deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance is monitored and reviewed quarterly 
if our conclusions change in the future regarding the realization of a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets  we may record a change to the valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period the determination is made  which may have a material impact on our results 
as of december   we were in a net deferred tax liability position with tax computed at regular tax rates on the gross temporary differences 
federal tax attributes related to minimum tax credit carry forwards and federal and state net 
table of contents operating losses partially offset the tax effect of the temporary differences 
if federal tax attributes related to alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and federal net operating loss carryforwards increase relative to our deferred tax liabilities  we may be required to establish additional valuation allowances 
at december   a valuation allowance of million has been provided on certain state net operating losses and gross deferred tax assets not expected to provide future tax benefits 
asset impairment 
us gaap requires that a long lived asset group that is held and used should be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group might not be recoverable 
testing long lived assets for impairment after indicators of impairment have been identified is a two step process 
step one compares the net undiscounted cash flows of an asset group to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of an asset group exceeds the net undiscounted cash flows of that asset group  step two is performed whereby the fair value of the asset group is estimated and compared to its carrying amount 
the amount of impairment  if any  is equal to the excess of the carrying value of an asset group over its estimated fair value 
the amount of impairment  if any  is allocated to the long lived assets on a pro rata basis  except that the carrying value of the individual long lived assets are not reduced below their estimated fair value 
our asset groups generally consist of the assets and applicable liabilities of one or more mines and preparation plants and associated coal reserves for which cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other mines  preparation plants and associated reserves 
during  as a result of certain announcements regarding production curtailments at certain mining operations  we determined that indicators of impairment were present for certain of our long lived asset groups 
we further determined that undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value for five of our asset groups 
for these five asset groups  we proceeded to step two and estimated the fair values of the asset groups 
the fair values of the asset groups were estimated using an income approach utilizing market place participant assumptions 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital discount rate 
the income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  income taxes  capital spending  working capital changes and the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our asset groups 
our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long term outlook of market prices expected to be be received for our coal 
if actual coal prices are less than our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our asset groups 
our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel  diesel fuel and explosives 
if actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our asset groups 
we also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation  much of which is beyond our control  which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our asset groups 
the carrying values of the five asset groups that proceeded to step two exceeded their estimated fair values and accordingly  we recorded asset impairment charges for the year ending december  of  million 
the asset impairment charges reduced the carrying values of mineral reserves by million  property  plant and equipment  by million  and other acquired intangibles by million 
the asset impairments established a new cost basis on which future depreciation  depletion and amortization will be based 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies 
goodwill is not amortized  instead  it is tested for impairment annually as of october of each year  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
we test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level 
for certain of our reporting units  we apply a qualitative assessment 
for the remaining reporting units  we perform our goodwill impairment test in two steps 
step one compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit determined in step one is lower than its carrying value  we proceed to step two  which compares the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value 
in estimating the implied fair value of goodwill at a reporting unit  we assigned the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities associated with the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
any excess of carrying value of goodwill over its implied fair value at a reporting unit is recorded as impairment 
the valuation methodology utilized in step one to estimate the fair value of the reporting units is based on both a market and income approach and is within the range of fair values yielded under each approach 
the income approach is based on a discounted cash flow methodology in which expected future net cash flows are discounted to present value  using an appropriate after tax weighted average cost of capital discount rate 
the market approach is based on a guideline company and similar transaction methodology 
under the guideline company approach  certain operating metrics from a selected group 
table of contents of publicly traded guideline companies that have similar operations to the company reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
under the similar transaction approach  recent merger and acquisition transactions for companies that have similar operations to the company reporting units are used to estimate the fair value of the company reporting units 
the income approach is dependent upon a number of significant management estimates about future performance including sales volumes and prices  costs to produce  income taxes  capital spending  working capital changes and the after tax weighted average cost of capital 
changes in any of these assumptions could materially impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
our forecasts of coal prices generally reflect a long term outlook of market prices expected to be be received for our coal 
if actual coal prices are less than our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units 
our forecasts of costs to produce coal are based on our operating forecasts and an assumed inflation rate for materials and supplies such as steel  diesel fuel and explosives 
if actual costs are higher or if inflation increases above our expectations  it could have a material impact on the fair value of our reporting units 
we also are faced with increasingly stringent safety standards and governmental regulation  much of which is beyond our control  which could increase our costs and materially decrease the fair value of our reporting units 
in connection with the testing of certain of our long lived assets for impairment  we performed a goodwill impairment test as of june  and recorded goodwill impairment of  million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value for nine reporting units in our eastern coal operations segment and one reporting unit in our western coal operations segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced the completion of a reorganization effort aimed at enhancing operational effectiveness by aligning our structure to a smaller production footprint following announced production curtailments 
the reorganization included personnel and structural changes and other consolidation efforts 
as a result  our internal management reporting structure was also changed 
as a result  prior to our annual goodwill impairment testing  we reassessed our reporting units based on our new management reporting structure 
we allocated the existing goodwill to our new reporting units based on a relative fair value approach as required under us gaap 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment test performed as of october   we recorded goodwill impairment of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value for one of our reporting units in our eastern coal operations segment 
the fair value of our other reporting unit in our eastern coal operations segment exceeded its carrying value by a total of approximately million  or 
contingencies 
we are parties to a number of legal proceedings 
these matters include personal injury claims  environmental issues and other matters more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we record accruals based on an estimate of the ultimate outcome of these matters  however these matters are difficult to predict and involve significant judgment by management 
new accounting pronouncements 
see note in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for disclosures related to new accounting policies adopted 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we manage our commodity price risk for coal sales through the use of long term coal supply agreements 
as of january   we had sales commitments for approximately of planned shipments for  of which is unpriced 
uncommitted and unpriced tonnage was for the discussion below presents the sensitivity of the market value of selected financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices 
the range of changes reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen 
we have exposure to price risk for supplies that are used directly or indirectly in the normal course of production such as diesel fuel  steel and other items such as explosives 
we manage our risk for these items through strategic sourcing contracts in normal quantities with our suppliers and may use derivative instruments from time to time  primarily swap contracts with financial institutions  for a certain percentage of our monthly requirements 
swap agreements essentially fix the price paid for our diesel fuel and explosives by requiring us to pay a fixed price and receive a floating price 
we expect to use approximately million gallons of diesel fuel in and through our derivative swap contracts  we have fixed prices for approximately and of our expected diesel fuel needs for and  respectively 
if the price of diesel fuel were to decrease in  our expense resulting from our diesel fuel derivative swap contracts would increase  which would be offset by a decrease in the cost of our physical diesel fuel purchases 
we also sell coalbed methane through our coal gas recovery business 
the revenues derived from the sale of coalbed methane are subject to volatility based on the changes in natural gas prices 
in order to reduce that risk  we enter into pay variable  receive fixed natural gas swaps for a portion of our anticipated gas production in order to fix the selling price for a portion of our production 
the natural gas swaps have been designated as qualifying cash flow hedges 
as of december   we had swap agreements outstanding to hedge the variable cash flows related to approximately of anticipated natural gas production in credit risk our credit risk is primarily with electric power generators and steel producers 
our policy is to independently evaluate each customer s creditworthiness prior to entering into transactions and to constantly monitor outstanding accounts receivable against established credit limits 
when appropriate as determined by our credit management function  we have taken steps to reduce our credit exposure to customers that do not meet our credit standards or whose credit has deteriorated 
these steps include obtaining letters of credit or cash collateral  requiring prepayments for shipments or establishing customer trust accounts held for our benefit in the event of a failure to pay 
interest rate risk our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
as we continue to monitor the interest rate environment in concert with our risk mitigation objectives  consideration is being given to future interest rate risk reduction strategies 
we have exposure to changes in interest rates through our credit agreement  which has a variable interest rate of percentage points over the libo rate  subject  in the case of the revolving credit line  to adjustment based on leverage ratios 
as of december   our term loan due under the credit agreement had an outstanding balance of million  net of debt discount of million 
the current portion of the term loan due in the next twelve months was million 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease our interest expense by million
