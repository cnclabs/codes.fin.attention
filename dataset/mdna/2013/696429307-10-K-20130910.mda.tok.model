item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read together with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and other financial information in this form k 
certain information is presented below excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation fx ie  had exchange rates not changed year over year 
we consider year over year change excluding fx to be an important measure because by excluding the impact of volatility of exchange rates  underlying impact of volume and rate changes are evident 
dollar amounts discussed below are in thousands  unless otherwise indicated  except per share dollar amounts 
in addition  per share dollar amounts are discussed on a diluted basis 
we utilize certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported financial information as well as to quantify the impact of various significant factors that contribute to the changes in our periodic results included in the discussion below

overview we are a leading supplier of filtration  separation and purification technologies 
our products are used to remove solid  liquid and gaseous contaminants from a variety of liquids and gases  and are principally made by us  using our engineering capability  fluid management expertise  proprietary filter media and manufacturing expertise 
our products primarily consist of consumable filtration products and filtration systems 
we serve customers through two businesses globally life sciences and industrial 
the life sciences business group serves customers in the biopharmaceutical  food beverage and medical markets 
the industrial business group serves customers in the process technologies  aerospace and microelectronics markets 
we operate globally in three geographic regions the americas  europe in which we include the middle east and africa  and asia 
our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches that transact in over thirty foreign currencies around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation had a cent impact on earnings per share in fiscal year on august   we sold our blood collection  filtration and processing product line the blood product line to haemonetics corporation for  we received a total of approximately  upon closing  with the balance payable upon transfer of related blood media manufacturing capabilities and assets 
the blood product line was a component of our life sciences segment and has been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented 
on june   we announced a  multi year strategic cost reduction initiative 
half of the initiative was executed in fiscal  with the balance to occur ratably over fiscal as part of our continued efforts to more strategically align our regional facilities and appropriately structure ourselves to cost effectively deliver high quality products and superior service to our customers worldwide  we initiated the closure of two of our facilities in the united states namely  ann arbor  michigan and fort myers  florida 
much of the work done at these sites will be relocated to other operations within the americas 
results from continuing operations net sales by segment life sciences industrial total sales by product consumables systems total sales the percentage change in sales year over year by segment  with and without the impact of foreign currency translation fx are presented below compared to compared to by segment change excluding fx fx total change change excluding fx fx total change life sciences industrial total the percentage change in sales year over year by product  with and without the impact of fx are presented below compared to compared to by product change excluding fx fx total change change excluding fx fx total change consumables systems total compared with sales increased approximately excluding fx reflecting growth in the life sciences segment  principally driven by the biopharmaceuticals market  partly offset by weakness in the process technologies and microelectronics markets in the industrial segment 
more details regarding sales by segment can be found in the discussions under the section segment review 
looking at sales by product  the approximately increase in consumables sales excluding fx reflects solid growth in the life sciences segment  principally driven by the biopharmaceuticals market  largely offset by weakness in the industrial segment in the process technologies and microelectronics markets 
increased pricing contributed  or about basis points to consumables sales growth year over year  reflecting increases in both segments 
the decline in system sales primarily reflects weak capital spending by food beverage customers in the life sciences segment  and weakness in municipal water  which is part of the process technologies market in the industrial segment  as customers continue to delay projects  given that funds available to the municipalities to support these projects have diminished 
compared with sales grew approximately excluding fx attributable to growth in life sciences  driven by the biopharmaceuticals market  and in industrial  on strength in the process technologies and aerospace markets 
looking at sales by product  the growth in overall consumables sales of approximately excluding fx was driven by strong growth in biopharmaceuticals in the life sciences segment  as well as strong growth in the process technologies and aerospace markets in the industrial segment 
increased pricing contributed  or about basis points  to consumables sales growth year over year  reflecting increases in both segments 
the growth in systems sales primarily reflects increased capital spend by pharmaceuticals customers in the life sciences segment  increased spend by food beverage customers in the life sciences segment in emerging markets  and increased spend in the process technologies market in the industrial segment as customers in the oil and gas sectors continued to invest to increase output 
gross margin gross profit gross margin of sales change year over year compared with gross profit dollars decreased  which is in line with the reduction in sales 
the increase in overall gross margin of basis points reflects a combination of many offsetting factors 
factors that improved gross margin include pricing  as noted above  lower obsolescence and warranty costs and our consumables products  which typically have higher margins than our systems products  comprising a larger proportion of our total sales 
these were largely offset by unfavorable consumables market mix 
more details regarding gross margin can be found in the discussions under the section segment review 
compared with the increase in overall gross margin of basis points was primarily driven by favorable pricing  as noted above  and the benefit of sales channel changes from distributor to direct sales  as well as favorable consumables market mix 
manufacturing cost savings achieved were offset by inflation in manufacturing costs and unfavorable overhead absorption 
more details regarding gross margin can be found in the discussions under the section segment review 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative of sales change year over year compared with the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a reflects savings generated by our structural cost improvement initiatives  as well as a favorable foreign currency translation of approximately basis points 
these decreases were partly offset by incremental depreciation expense resulting from the go live of the last significant phase of our erp system implementation  incremental costs related to fortebio which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year  select investments in high growth markets  and inflationary increases in payroll and related costs 
compared with the increase in sg a primarily reflects the following factors project related costs in information technology incurred as we concluded the last significant phase of our global erp system implementation  increased expenses driven by resource deployment related to regional expansion in latin america including incremental costs related to an acquisition in brazil  the middle east and asia  incremental costs related to the acquisition of fortebio  costs related to bringing industrial into our european and asian headquarters  and inflationary increases in payroll and related costs 
these increases were partly offset by favorable foreign currency translation of approximately basis points and savings realized from our cost reduction programs 
research development research and development of sales change year over year compared with the increase in research and development expenses r d  reflects the earlier announced strategy to increase innovation investment in the life sciences and industrial segments 
this was driven by our focus on new product development and innovation  including development of our media and instrumentation capabilities 
the year over year comparative also reflects spend related to fortebio which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year 
compared with the increase in r d reflects increased spending in the life science segment  including spend related to fortebio 
restructuring and other charges  net restructuring and other charges  net restructuring and other charges rotc reflect the expenses incurred in connection with our structural cost improvement initiatives  impacting both segments as well as the corporate services group 
furthermore  rotc includes charges related to certain employment contract obligations and an increase to environmental reserves 
rotc includes expenses incurred in connection with our structural cost improvement initiatives as discussed above 
rotc also includes charges related to certain employment contract obligations 
such charges were partly offset by a gain on the sale of assets 
rotc includes expenses incurred in connection with the company s cost reduction initiatives  including the closure of an industrial manufacturing facility in europe 
furthermore  rotc includes charges related to certain employment contract obligations and an increase to previously established environmental reserves 
the details of rotc  as well as the activity related to restructuring liabilities that were recorded related to our structural cost improvement initiatives and industrial cost reduction initiatives  can be found in note  restructuring and other charges  net  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net interest expense  net compared with interest expense  net  in fiscal years and reflect the reversal of accrued interest of  and  respectively  primarily related to the resolution of us tax audits 
excluding the benefits described above  interest expense  net  in fiscal year and fiscal year would have been  and  respectively 
the resulting decrease in net interest expense of  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily driven by a reduction in other income tax related interest expense excluding those referenced above 
compared with interest expense  net  in fiscal year reflects the net reversal of  of accrued interest primarily related to the resolution of us tax audits  partially offset by an interest accrual related to foreign tax matters 
excluding these items and the benefit in fiscal year described above  net interest expense decreased compared to fiscal year income taxes income taxes effective tax rate compared with the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a net tax benefit of  primarily from the resolution of a us tax audit partly offset by the establishment of deferred tax liabilities for the repatriation of foreign earnings 
excluding these impacts  as well as the impact of rotc and interest discussed above  the effective tax rates for fiscal years and would have been and  respectively 
the reduction in the tax rate is a result of the extension of the federal research credit in fiscal year and a favorable geographical mix of earnings 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the internal revenue service irs concluded its audits of fiscal years through  including the matter previously disclosed for those years in note  audit committee inquiry and restatement  to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k 
in closing the audit  the irs did not assess any penalties 
we will not make any further cash payments to the irs or receive any refunds with respect to these matters 
compared with the effective tax rate for fiscal year reflects a tax benefit from the resolution of a us tax audit partly offset by tax costs associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings and the establishment of our asian headquarters in singapore 
excluding this impact  as well as the impact of rotc and interest discussed above  the effective tax rates for fiscal years and would have been and  respectively 
the decrease in tax rate year over year reflects tax benefits associated with our asian headquarters in singapore and the expansion of our european headquarters in switzerland 
net earnings net earnings diluted earnings per share we estimate that foreign currency translation decreased earnings per share by cents in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year and had an immaterial impact on earnings per share in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the decrease in share count in fiscal year compared to fiscal year benefited diluted earnings per share in fiscal year by approximately cents 
results from discontinued operations sales net earnings diluted earnings per share the increase in net earnings in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily reflects the gain on the sale of the blood product line

biopharmaceuticals consumables sales growth reflects continued strength in the biotech sector in all three regions 
the fortebio acquisition acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year added approximately million  or  in biopharmaceuticals consumables sales growth 
food beverage consumables sales were down slightly excluding fx 
this reflects overall softness in eastern europe and weakness in the wine sector in france and australia  partly offset by the impact of geographic expansion in latin america 
medical consumables sales growth reflects an increase in sales to hospitals primarily driven by point of use water filtration sales  principally in europe 
furthermore  media sales  under a supply agreement with the purchaser of our blood product line  contributed approximately basis points to medical consumables sales growth year over year 
life sciences systems sales were down primarily due to weak capital spending in the food beverage market in the americas and asia 
life sciences segment profit was essentially flat year over year despite the growth in sales 
this reflects the impact of the decline in gross margin percentage combined with increased sg a costs and r d investment 
the decline of basis points in gross margin percentage is primarily due to unfavorable product mix and the impact of a weaker japanese yen particularly in the second half of fiscal year  where a large portion of goods sold are sourced from outside of japan  partly offset by the benefit of favorable pricing 
the increase in sg a reflects incremental costs related to fortebio acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year and increased investments we are making for future growth  partly offset by savings achieved by our structural cost improvement initiatives 
the increase in r d spend was driven by our focus on new product development and innovation  particularly for development of our instrumentation capabilities  including spend related to fortebio 
the translation impact of fx reduced segment profit by approximately basis points 
compared with life sciences consumables sales growth excluding fx was driven by strong growth in biopharmaceuticals 
biopharmaceuticals consumables sales growth reflects strength in the biotech sector 
the fortebio acquisition acquired in the third quarter of fiscal year added approximately million  or  in biopharmaceuticals consumables sales growth in the year 
food beverage consumables sales were down over excluding fx year over year 
however  excluding the impact of the divestiture of a non core asset group in italy in the first quarter of fiscal year  food beverage consumables sales grew about  driven by new market applications and products augmented by growth in emerging markets 
medical consumables sales were down reflecting the impact of weak economic conditions in europe and fewer infection outbreaks  which resulted in reduced spending by hospitals  as well as pricing competition  particularly in latin america 
the increase in life sciences systems sales reflects increased capital spend by pharmaceuticals customers driven by strength in the biotech sector  as well as increased spend in food beverage  driven by emerging markets 
life sciences segment profit grew approximately 
this reflects the growth in sales augmented by the improvement in gross margin percentage  partly offset by an increase in sg a 
the improvement in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable pricing and the benefit of sales channel changes from distributor to direct sales  with the remainder attributable to favorable mix driven by growth in pharmaceuticals consumables sales 
the increase in sg a was primarily driven by regional expansion into emerging markets and incremental costs related to the acquisition of fortebio

process technologies consumables sales decreased driven by weakness across all sub markets  principally in europe and asia  with the machinery equipment submarket having the most significant impact 
the sales results by submarket are discussed below consumables sales in the machinery equipment submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales in the year  decreased almost year over year 
this reflects weakness in all end markets with the largest impacts felt in europe and asia 
furthermore  the sales decline year over year reflects our decision to exit certain low margin product lines in europe 
consumables sales in the fuels chemicals submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales in the year  were down about year over year on weakness in europe 
consumables sales in the power generation submarket  which represented close to of total industrial consumables sales in the year  declined approximately reflecting weakness in asia related to a decrease in demand from wind turbine oems 
aerospace consumables sales growth was driven by increased commercial aerospace sales partly offset by a decline in military aerospace sales 
sales to the commercial aerospace submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales  increased about  driven by increased aftermarket sales and sales to oems 
sales in the military aerospace submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales  decreased about  reflecting the impact of strong helicopter program sales in fiscal year that did not repeat in fiscal year this was partly mitigated by increased sales to military oems 
the fulfillment of past due backlog also contributed to fiscal year sales in both the commercial and militaryaerospace submarkets 
microelectronics consumables sales were down reflecting continuing weakness in our customer end markets particularly in the semiconductor  display and data storage sectors  with the most significant impact seen in asia 
growth in the graphic arts end market in europe partly mitigated the impact 
the decrease in industrial systems sales primarily reflects weakness in municipal water  as customers continue to delay projects given that funds available to the municipalities to support these projects have diminished 
industrial segment profit grew despite the decline in sales 
this increase was primarily driven by the decline in sg a expenses attributable to our structural cost improvement initiatives 
in addition  the improvement in gross margin percentage of basis points was primarily driven by pricing  mostly offset by unfavorable consumables market mix 
the impact of fx reduced segment profit by approximately basis points 
compared with industrial consumables sales excluding fx were up driven by growth in the process technologies and aerospace markets  partly offset by weakness in the microelectronics market 
process technologies consumables sales growth was driven by increases across most sub markets  with the fuels chemicals and the machinery equipment submarkets having the most significant impact 
the sales results by submarket are discussed below consumables sales in the machinery equipment submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales  increased about  driven by growth in the mining  automotive in plant and mobile oem sectors 
consumables sales in the fuels chemicals submarket  which represented approximately of total industrial consumables sales  increased about 
robust growth in the oil gas  refining and alternative energy sectors were key growth drivers in the year 
consumables sales in the power generation submarket  which represented close to of total industrial consumables sales  decreased about primarily due to weakness in asia related to a decrease in demand for wind turbine oems in china and a reduction in nuclear spend in japan and china 
aerospace consumables sales increased year over year driven by strong growth in the military aerospace submarket augmented by growth in the commercial aerospace submarket 
sales to the military aerospace submarket  which represented about of total industrial consumables sales  increased about  reflecting double digit growth in each of the three regions 
sales to the commercial aerospace submarket  which represented less than of total industrial consumables sales  increased  reflecting increases in oem production rates and aftermarket sales related to an increase in passenger miles flown 
microelectronics consumables sales were down  reflecting a decline in semiconductor chip production 
furthermore  the display sector continued to be weak due to overcapacity and the data storage sector struggled due to weak pc sales 
the increase in industrial systems sales was driven by the process technologies market as customers in the oil and gas sectors continued to invest to increase output 
the bulk of this investment reflected expansion plans in brazil  eastern europe and the middle east 
industrial segment profit grew approximately 
this reflects the growth in sales and a slight improvement in gross margin percentage  partly offset by an increase in sg a 
the improvement in gross margin percentage of basis points was primarily driven by pricing 
manufacturing cost savings achieved were offset by inflation in manufacturing costs and unfavorable overhead absorption 
the increase in sg a was primarily driven by regional expansion into emerging markets as well as costs related to bringing industrial into our european and asian headquarters 
the impact of fx increased segment profit by approximately basis points 
corporate services group corporate services group expenses change year over year compared with the increase in corporate services group expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily reflects an increase in payroll related costs 
compared with the increase in corporate services group expenses in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily reflects an increase in payroll and related costs and costs associated with the executive management transition 
liquidity and capital resources we utilize cash flow generated from operations and our commercial paper program to meet our short term liquidity needs 
we consider our cash balances  lines of credit and access to the commercial paper and other credit markets  along with the cash typically generated from operations  to be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs 
our cash position  net of debt  was approximately  at july   compared to a net debt position of  at july   a change of  the impact of foreign exchange rates increased net cash by about  excluding this impact  net cash increased by  reflecting an increase in cash and cash equivalents of  and a decrease in gross debt of  as of july   the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries was  we do not expect any restrictions or taxes on repatriation of cash held outside of the us to have a material effect on our overall liquidity 
on april   we entered into a five year  unsecured senior revolving credit facility the new facility with a syndicate of banks  which expires on april   and terminated our existing  senior revolving credit facility  which would have expired in fiscal year the prior facility 
borrowings under the new facility bear interest at either a variable rate based upon the london interbank offered rate us dollar  british pound  euro  swiss franc and japanese yen borrowings or the european union banking federation rate euro borrowings or at the prime rate of the facility agent us dollar borrowing only 
the new facility does not permit us to exceed a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of  based upon the trailing four quarters results 
in addition  the new facility includes other covenants that under certain circumstances may restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments and other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create liens and sell assets 
as of july   we were in compliance with all related financial and other restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness 
as of july   we had  of outstanding commercial paper  which is recorded as notes payable in the current liability section of our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
commercial paper outstanding at any one time during the year had balances ranging from  to  carried interest rates ranging between and and original maturities between and days 
commercial paper outstanding at july  carried an interest rate of and maturities between and days 
as of july   we did not have any outstanding borrowings under our new facility 
cash flow operating activities net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures free cash flow fiscal year the major items impacting net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year include net earnings from continuing operations of  non cash reconciling items in net earnings from continuing operations  such as depreciation and amortization of long lived assets of  and non cash stock compensation of  income tax and tax related payments of approximately  related to the settlement of  and deposits for  several years of us tax audits and payments for the gain on the sale of the blood product line  and defined benefit pension plan contributions of  discontinued operations had an immaterial impact on net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year fiscal year the major items impacting net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year include net earnings of  non cash reconciling items in net earnings  such as depreciation and amortization of long lived assets of  and non cash stock compensation of  and defined benefit pension plan contributions of  the net earnings from discontinued operations adjusted for non cash reconciling items in fiscal year and fiscal year were approximately  and  respectively 
this includes transaction related costs  net of tax  of  related to the divestiture of the blood product line in fiscal year free cash flow we utilize free cash flow as one way to measure our current and future financial performance 
free cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and is not intended as an alternative measure of cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our calculation of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines 
the table above reconciles net cash provided by operating activities  inclusive of discontinued operations  to free cash flow 
the decrease in free cash flow in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily reflects the decline in net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above 
this was partly offset by a decrease in capital expenditures  as fiscal year included the purchase of a new facility in europe and investment in our global erp system 
the increase in free cash flow in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily reflects the increase in net cash provided by operating activities as discussed above 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense and amortization expense are presented below depreciation expense amortization expense includes depreciation and amortization expense from discontinued operations totaling  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
cash flow investing activities net cash provided used by investing activities the most significant drivers of net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year include proceeds from the sale of assets of  primarily related to the sale of our blood product line  and capital expenditures of  which partly offset the above 
cash flow financing activities net cash used by financing activities share repurchases in fiscal years  and  are presented below 
for further information on the company s share buyback programs  see note  common stock  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
share repurchases number of shares we increased our quarterly dividend by from cents to cents per share  effective with the dividend declared on september  dividends paid in fiscal years  and are presented below dividends paid dividends declared per share net proceeds from equity compensation plans were  in fiscal year non cash working capital non cash working capital  which is defined as working capital excluding cash and cash equivalents  notes receivable  notes payable and the current portion of long term debt  was approximately  at july  as compared with  at july  this includes working capital related to our discontinued operations  however  this excludes assets aggregating approximately  at july  classified as held for sale that otherwise would have been reported as non current 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange discussed below  non cash working capital decreased approximately  compared to july  our balance sheet is affected by spot exchange rates used to translate local currency amounts into us dollars 
in comparing spot exchange rates at july  to those at july   the euro has strengthened against the us dollar  and the british pound and the japanese yen have weakened against the us dollar 
the effect of foreign currency translation  increased net inventory  net accounts receivable and other current assets by  and  respectively  as compared to july  additionally  foreign currency translation increased accounts payable and other current liabilities by  and decreased current income taxes payable by the combination of these foreign currency translation impacts decreased non cash working capital by  derivatives we manage certain financial exposures through a risk management program that includes the use of foreign exchange derivative financial instruments 
derivatives are executed with counterparties with a minimum credit rating of a by standard and poor s and moody s investor services  in accordance with our policies 
we do not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we conduct transactions in currencies other than their functional currency 
these transactions include non functional currency intercompany and external sales as well as intercompany and external purchases 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts  matching the notional amounts and durations of the receivables and payables resulting from the aforementioned underlying foreign currency transactions  to mitigate the exposure to earnings and cash flows caused by changing foreign exchange rates 
the risk management objective of holding foreign exchange derivatives is to mitigate volatility to earnings and cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts entered into during the year ended july  was  the notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of july  was  of which  are for cash flow hedges that cover monthly transactional exposures through february our foreign currency balance sheet exposures resulted in the recognition of a gain within sg a of approximately  in the year ended july   before the impact of the measures described above 
including the impact of our foreign exchange derivative instruments  the net recognition within sg a was a loss of approximately  in the year ended july  contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual payment commitments as of july  interest on long term debt includes the amount of interest due to be paid during the respective fiscal year based upon the amount of debt outstanding as of july  year ended thereafter total long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases purchase commitments other commitments total commitments we had gross liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately  and related accrued interest and penalties of  as of july   which were excluded from the table above 
see note  income taxes  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from estimates 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and that require judgment 
see also the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which contain additional information regarding our accounting policies 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and appropriate segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which a final determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount of the future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net earnings in the period in which such determination is made 
purchase accounting and goodwill determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
there are various methods used to estimate the value of tangible and intangible assets acquired  such as discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the two approaches include projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows  perpetual growth rate  determination of appropriate market comparables  and the determination of whether a premium or a discount should be applied to comparables 
there are also judgments made to determine the expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we perform impairment testing for goodwill at least annually during our fiscal third quarter  or more frequently if certain events or circumstances indicate impairment might have occurred 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level 
our two segments  life sciences and industrial  are also deemed to be our reporting units for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  the overall fair value for the reporting unit is compared to its book value including goodwill 
in the event that the overall fair value of the reporting unit was determined to be less than the book value  a second step is performed which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the book value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value for the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the overall fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of the net identifiable assets 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than its book value  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests as of march  and march  the estimated fair values of both the life sciences and industrial reporting units substantially exceeded the carrying values of these reporting units  and as such  step two was not performed 
when testing for impairment  we use significant estimates and assumptions to estimate the fair values of our reporting units 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined using market multiples derived from trailing twelve month revenue  earnings before interest and taxes ebit and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda  of publicly traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as our reporting units 
these various market multiples are applied to the operating performance of the reporting unit being tested to determine a range of fair values for the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting units for the purposes of the goodwill impairment test is then determined using the mean of the fair values derived from the minimum and median market multiples 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
the minimum and median market multiples used in the fiscal year impairment testing ranged from to times revenue  to times ebit and to times ebitda 
to further substantiate the reasonableness of the fair value of our reporting units  we compare enterprise value outstanding shares multiplied by the closing market price per share  plus debt  less cash and cash equivalents to the aggregate fair value of our reporting units 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and when contractual terms have been fulfilled  except for certain long term contracts  whereby revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method see below 
transfer of title and risk of loss occurs when the product is delivered in accordance with the contractual shipping terms 
in instances where contractual terms include a provision for customer acceptance  revenue is recognized when either i we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria based on either seller or customer specified objective criteria or ii upon formal acceptance received from the customer where the product has not been previously demonstrated to meet customer specified objective criteria 
for contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognition is based upon the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with estimated total costs to complete 
the cumulative impact of revisions to total estimated costs is reflected in the period of the change  including anticipated losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances when collection becomes doubtful 
in performing this evaluation  significant estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis 
based upon this information  we record in earnings an amount believed to be uncollectible 
if the factors used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts do not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost principally on the first in  first out method or market 
we record adjustments to the carrying value of inventory based upon assumptions about historic usage  future demand and market conditions 
these adjustments are estimates which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
defined benefit retirement plans we sponsor defined benefit retirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the liabilities and expense 
the actuarial assumptions used by us are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense and pension assets liabilities we record 
pension expense associated with our defined benefit plans was  in fiscal year  which was based on a weighted average discount rate of calculated using the projected benefit obligation and a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of calculated using the fair value of plan assets 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased approximately  the objective of the discount rate assumption is to reflect the rate at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
our methodology for selecting the discount rate for the us plans as of july  was to match the plan s cash flows to that of a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero coupon corporate bonds for each maturity 
this is under the premise that cash flows for benefits due in a particular year can be theoretically settled by investing them in the zero coupon bond that matures in the same year 
the discount rate is the single rate that produces the same present value of cash flows 
the discount rate assumption for non us plans reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments 
both discount rate assumptions are based on the expected duration of benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
if the weighted average discount rate was reduced by basis points  pension expense in fiscal year would have increased by approximately accrued expenses and contingencies we estimate certain expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
when no estimate in a given range is deemed to be better than any other  the low end of the range is accrued 
differences between estimates and assumptions and actual results could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
environmental accruals are recorded based upon historical costs incurred and estimates for future costs of remediation and on going legal expenses which have a high degree of uncertainty 
self insured workers compensation insurance accruals are recorded based on insurance claims processed  including applied loss development factors as well as historical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
self insured employee medical insurance accruals are recorded based on medical claims processed as well as historical medical claims experience for claims incurred but not yet reported 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued new accounting guidance intended to simplify goodwill impairment testing 
entities are allowed to perform a qualitative assessment on goodwill impairment to determine whether it is more likely than not defined as having a likelihood of more than percent that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance was effective for goodwill impairment tests performed in interim and annual periods for fiscal years beginning after december   which for us was the first quarter of fiscal  with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of this accounting guidance did not have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income 
specifically  the new guidance requires an entity to present components of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement  referred to as the statement of comprehensive income  or in two separate  but consecutive statements 
the new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity 
in december  the fasb issued an amendment to defer indefinitely a requirement in the june standard that called for reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income to be measured and presented by income statement line item in net income and also in other comprehensive income 
while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income  there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance 
the adoption of this disclosure only guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year did not have an impact on our consolidated financial results 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which amends accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income 
the amended guidance requires entities to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component 
additionally  entities are required to present  either on the face of the financial statements or in the notes  significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income  but only if the amount reclassified is required under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap to be reclassified to net income in its entirety in the same reporting period 
for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures in the financial statements 
the amended guidance does not change the current requirements for reporting net income or other comprehensive income 
the amendments will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year as this is disclosure only guidance  it will not have an impact on our consolidated financial results 
in july  the fasb issued new accounting guidance which requires the netting of unrecognized tax benefits against a deferred tax asset for a loss or other carry forward that would apply in settlement of the uncertain tax positions 
under the new standard  unrecognized tax benefits will be netted against all available same jurisdiction loss or other tax carry forwards that would be utilized  rather than only against carry forwards that are created by the unrecognized tax benefits 
the new guidance is effective prospectively to all existing unrecognized tax benefits  but entities can choose to apply it retrospectively 
the guidance will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal year  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated statements of financial position and cash flows

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risks relate to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the sensitivity analyses presented below assume simultaneous shifts in each respective rate  and quantify the impact on our earnings and cash flows 
the changes used for these analyses reflect our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
actual changes that differ from the changes used for these analyses could yield materially different results 
foreign currency our reporting currency is the us dollar 
because we operate through subsidiaries or branches that transact in over thirty foreign currencies around the world  our earnings are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of the subsidiaries or branches  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
we estimate that foreign exchange translation had a cent impact on earnings per share in fiscal year most of our products are manufactured in the us  puerto rico  germany and the united kingdom  and then sold into many countries 
the primary foreign currency exposures relate to adverse changes in the relationships of the us dollar to the euro  the japanese yen  the british pound the pound  the brazilian real and the indian rupee  as well as adverse changes in the relationship of the pound to the euro 
exposure exists when the functional currency of the buying subsidiaries weakens against the us dollar  the pound or the euro  thus causing an increase of the product cost to the buying subsidiary or a reduction in the sales price from the selling subsidiary  which adversely affects our consolidated gross margin and net earnings 
in fiscal year  the japanese yen  euro  pound  brazilian real and indian rupee  weakened by approximately    and  respectively  against the us dollar compared with the average exchange rates in effect in fiscal year additionally  the euro weakened against the pound by less than 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from adverse changes in exchange rates 
one component of this exposure relates to short term transaction exposures of primarily yen  euro  pound and swiss franc denominated receivables and payables 
these short term exposures to changing foreign currency exchange rates are managed by opening forward foreign exchange contracts forwards to offset the earnings and cash flow impact of non functional currency denominated receivables and payables as well as the expeditious payment of balances 
at july   the net balance sheet exposures amounted to approximately  and were offset by net forward contracts with a notional principal amount of  if a hypothetical simultaneous adverse change had occurred in exchange rates as of july   net earnings would have decreased by approximately  or approximately cents per share 
in addition to these balance sheet related mitigation activities  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company began to use forwards for cash flow hedging on its forecasted transactional exposure to the euro due to changes in market rates to exchange euros for pounds 
the hedges cover a british subsidiary pound functional currency with euro revenues and a swiss subsidiary with a euro functional currency with pound expenses 
the probability of the occurrence of these transactions is high and our assessment is based on observable facts  including the frequency and amounts of similar past transactions 
the objective of the cash flow hedges is to lock in the forecasted impact of the pound equivalent amount of euro sales for the british subsidiary and the euro equivalent amount of pound expenses for the swiss subsidiary  at the agreed upon exchange rates in the forwards 
the notional amount of forwards outstanding as of july  was  and cover monthly transactional exposures through july we do not enter into forwards for trading purposes 
interest rates we currently have offsetting exposures with respect to changes in interest rates 
this is primarily due to our variable rate positions on debt and accrued liabilities compared to our variable rate positions on cash and retirement benefit assets 
our debt portfolio is comprised of both fixed and variable rate borrowings 
our debt portfolio was approximately variable rate at july   compared to variable rate at july  our cash position was variable rate at july  and july  for the year ended july   interest expense on variable rate debt and accrued liabilities was  and interest income on variable rate cash and retirement benefit assets was  a hypothetical shift in market interest rates for fiscal year eg  if an assumed market interest rate of increased to could have a beneficial effect on interest  net of approximately
