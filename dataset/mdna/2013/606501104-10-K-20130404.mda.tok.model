our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world  which are described under customers  sales  backlog and marketing 
we own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers 
our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition  including various electronic components of land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems  geophones and cables  peripheral equipment  survey and other equipment 
the majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by the sercel subsidiaries of compagnie generale de geophysique sercel 
however  we also purchase equipment from a number of other equipment manufacturers  including ion geophysical corporation ion  geospace technologies corporation geospace and inova geophysical equipment limited  an affiliate of ion 
at january   approximately of our equipment lease pool  on a cost basis  consisted of seismic recording channels  with the remainder consisting of geophones  energy source controllers and other peripheral equipment 
for the past several years  we have had a series of supply and exclusive lease referral agreements with sercel  which we believe have provided us with certain competitive advantages  primarily due to preferential pricing arrangements under the agreements 
under these agreements  we have been the exclusive worldwide short term leasing representative for certain products 
see key supplier agreements the sercel lease agreement for further information about this agreement 

table of contents we lease our equipment on a short term basis  generally for two to six months  to seismic contractors who need equipment for a particular seismic survey 
certain equipment that is used in vertical seismic profiling  or downhole operations  is generally leased to oil field service companies and generally for shorter periods  ranging from a few days to two weeks 
short term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies 
a typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys 
our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew 
demand for short term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors  including i the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys  ii seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions  iii the term of the lease and iv the cost of seismic equipment 
we believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short term seismic equipment leasing as a cost effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  acquisition cost and the term of the lease 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to companies in the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
mii and mcl also sell a broad range of used seismic equipment on a worldwide basis 
due to the acquisition of aes  mcl owns certain patent rights related to  and produces  leases and sells  heli pickers and related equipment to the seismic industry 
we believe that we are the leading provider of this equipment to the seismic industry 
seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and the buoylink rgps tracking system  which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
we believe that seamap  with the gunlink product line  is now the primary provider of new energy source controllers in the seismic industry 
for information regarding our net income and total assets by segment  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
business strategy our business strategy is to meet the needs of the seismic industry by leasing a wide range of equipment and to provide technologically advanced solutions for marine seismic applications 
to accomplish this  we have identified the following major objectives provide a technologically advanced seismic equipment lease pool 
we intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool 
we believe that the availability of a large and diverse seismic equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers to lease  rather than purchase  such equipment  due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short term leases 
continue to expand international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our international leasing activities in new geographic areas as customer demand warrants 
we believe there are opportunities to continue to expand our international leasing and sales activities 
we believe that we can conduct business in wide ranging geographic areas from our existing facilities 
however  for legal  tax or operational reasons  we may decide in the future to establish facilities in additional locations 
we generally expect to establish any such facilities through a green field approach  but we may consider making selective acquisitions from time to time 
maintain alliances with major seismic equipment manufacturers 
our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers  particularly sercel  allow us to expand our equipment lease pool through favorable pricing and delivery terms 
we believe these relationships provide a competitive advantage 

table of contents pursue additional business development opportunities 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business activities within the oil service industry  particularly in the seismic sector 
these opportunities could include the introduction of new products or services or the acquisition of existing businesses 
seismic technology and the oil service industry seismic surveys are a principal source of information used by oil and gas companies to identify geological conditions that are favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas and to evaluate the potential for successful drilling  development and production of oil and gas 
seismic technology has been used by the oil and gas industry since the s  and has advanced significantly with improvements in computing and electronic technologies 
beginning in the early s  the oil and gas industry significantly expanded its use of d seismic data 
d seismic data provides a more comprehensive subsurface image and is believed to have contributed to improved drilling success rates  particularly in mature oil and gas basins such as those in north america 
additionally  d seismic data continues to be used in many areas where d data acquisition is cost prohibitive or logistical access is limited 
oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells  in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas 
a complete digital seismic data acquisition system generally consists of i a central electronics unit that records and stores digital data ceu  ii seismic recording channel boxes that convert analog signals to a digital fomat channels  iii geophones  or seismic sensors  iv energy sources including dynamite  air guns or earth vibrators that create the necessary acoustic wave to be recorded  v cables that transmit digital seismic data from the channels to the ceu  in the case of cabled systems  vi geographic survey equipment  vii drilling equipment used in the seismic survey and viii other peripheral  or accessory  equipment 
in certain applications  specialized seismic recording devices are deployed vertically within a well bore 
multiple recording channels  or levels  are generally deployed within a given well and are referred to as downhole or vsp vertical seismic profiling tools 
these applications are used to provide additional data points in a traditional seismic survey  to monitor and analyze reservoir properties  and to monitor and analyze fluid treatment operations  as well as a variety of other uses 
in seismic data acquisition  an acoustic wave is generated at or below the earth s surface through the discharge of compressed air  the detonation of small explosive charges or the use of large mechanical vibrators 
as the acoustic wave travels through the earth  it is partially reflected by the underlying rock layers and the reflected energy is captured by sensors  such as geophones  which are situated at intervals along paths from the point of acoustical impulse 
the resulting signals are then transmitted to the channels  which convert the signals from analog to digital format and transmit this data via cable to the ceu 
in the case of wireless recording systems  the data is extracted from the recording channels via a wireless network or the channels are collected and taken to a central location for data extraction 
the ceu stores the seismic data on magnetic tape  disk or other recording media for processing 
the digital data is then input into a specialized seismic processing system that uses sophisticated computer software programs to enhance the recorded signal and produce an image of the subsurface strata 
by interpreting seismic data  oil and gas exploration companies create detailed maps of exploration prospects and oil and gas reservoirs 
historically  a d seismic survey was the standard data acquisition technique used to map geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data can be visualized as a single vertical plane of subsurface information 
data gathered from a d seismic survey is best visualized as a cube of information that can be sliced into numerous planes  providing different views of a geologic structure with much higher resolution than is available with traditional d seismic survey techniques 
d seismic surveys generally require a larger amount of equipment than d surveys 
by using a greater number of channels and flexible configuration  d seismic 
table of contents data provides more extensive and detailed information regarding the subsurface geology than d data 
as a result  d data allows the geophysicists interpreting the data to more closely select the optimal location of a prospective drill site or define an oil and gas reservoir 
in the exploration and development process  oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives 
because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells  decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process 
since d seismic data increases drilling success rates and reduces costs  we believe that d seismic surveys are now predominant 
as a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data  which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit data  seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years 
industry advances include the use of high resolution d  three component senors d c  which enhance the d image of the sub surface  and time lapse d seismic techniques  where surveys are periodically reacquired to allow the monitoring of producing oil and gas fields for optimal production and reserve recovery 
these and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs 
with the expanded use of seismic technology  particularly d seismic surveys  the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years 
demand for higher resolution data  larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys now requires seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels 
additionally  the size of seismic surveys varies significantly  requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys 
as a result of these changes  the number of seismic survey channels has increased from smaller d surveys  which typically averaged channels  to larger d surveys  which today average more than  channels and sometimes use as many as  channels 
we believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary  thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment 
seismic surveys utilizing d  d or d techniques require essentially the same equipment 
the manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs  however 
accordingly  our equipment can generally be utilized in d  d and d seismic surveys 
since d and d seismic surveys generally utilize significantly more equipment than d seismic surveys  the potential to lease our seismic equipment has increased from earlier periods 
business and operations equipment leasing 
we own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short term leasing to our customers  who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers in the case of downhole equipment 
we lease this equipment multiple times until the earlier of the end of its useful life or its sale 
our equipment leasing services generally include the lease of the various components of seismic data acquisition systems and related equipment to meet a customer s job specifications 
these specifications frequently vary as to the number of required recording channels  geophones  energy sources eg  earth vibrators and other equipment 
our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment 
our land equipment lease pool includes a total of approximately  seismic recording land channels each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data  geophones and cables  and other peripheral equipment 
our lease pool of marine seismic equipment includes more than kilometers of streamers recording channels that are towed behind a vessel  air guns  streamer positioning equipment  energy source controllers and other equipment 
our lease pool of downhole equipment includes approximately levels of downhole seismic tools 
our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry 
our marine lease pool also includes energy source controllers and rgps tracking systems that are manufactured by our seamap segment 

table of contents our equipment leases generally have terms of two to six months  a few days to two weeks in the case of downhole equipment  and are typically renewable following the initial rental period 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  initial cost and the term of the lease 
we provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and will provide replacement equipment  as necessary 
in addition  we provide field technical support services when requested by our customers 
the customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages other than normal wear and tear and replacing destroyed or lost equipment under the terms of our standard lease agreements 
the customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes  other than income taxes  related to the lease of the equipment 
the customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance 
it is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly basis or on a daily rate depending on the circumstances 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
seismic survey operations can also be effected by other weather patterns such as periods of heavy rain 
while these periods of heavy rain can affect our business in certain geographic regions  the primary seasonality of our business relates to the canadian and russian winter seasons 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
for additional information about the impact of seasonality and weather  see item a risk factors 
upon completion of a lease  the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities for inspection  testing and  if necessary  repair 
while the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs  during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer 
therefore  managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations 
given the short term of most of our leases  we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 
however  many factors can affect this utilization rate  including the term of our leases  the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities  the time required to inspect  test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment 
we maintain facilities for the inspection  testing and repair of land seismic equipment in huntsville  texas  calgary  alberta  ufa  bashkortostan  russia  bogota  colombia  budapest  hungary  brisbane  australia and singapore 
we maintain marine equipment inspection  testing and repair facilities in huntsville  texas and singapore 
we believe that this broad network of support facilities helps us effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations 
lease pool equipment sales 
on occasion  we sell used equipment from our lease pool  normally in response to specific customer demand or to declining demand for rental of specific equipment 
used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item 
when used equipment is sold from our lease pool  the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold 
sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect 
sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately million  million and million in each of the three fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
we typically do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment on a regular basis 
however  we will evaluate any opportunities for the sale of equipment from our lease pool  and based upon our evaluation  may sell additional equipment 
such sales of lease pool equipment could be material 
under the terms of our lease agreements  customers are responsible for lost or destroyed equipment 
charges for such lost equipment are at prices specified in the particular lease agreement and are reflected as lease pool equipment sales in the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents other equipment sales 
the other equipment sales included in our equipment leasing segment fall into three broad categories sales of new seismic equipment 
on occasion  we will sell new seismic equipment in response to a specific demand from a customer 
these sales are made in cooperation with our suppliers of lease pool equipment and often contain a financing arrangement

the initial term of the agreement expired on december  and was extended by mutual consent through december  subsequent to december   the parties have continued to operate under the terms of the agreement and a series of supplemental agreements 

table of contents customers  sales  backlog and marketing our lease customers generally are seismic data acquisition contractors 
we typically have a small number of lease customers  the composition of which changes yearly as leases are negotiated and concluded and equipment needs vary 
as of january   we had approximately lease customers with active leases of various lengths  but all for less than a year 
we do not maintain a backlog of orders relating to our equipment leasing segment 
as of january   our seamap segment had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately million  compared to million as of january  we expect all of these orders to be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending january  we participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the industry of our products and services and we advertise in major geophysical trade journals

the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
no other customer accounted for or more of our revenues during these periods 
see item a risk factors 
competition our major competitors include the seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms or offer leases with purchase options and seismic contractors who might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time 
we face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing  but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic presence as we do 
we compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of i price  ii delivery terms  iii availability of desired equipment and iv location of equipment 
we believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies 
we compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners  including seismic data acquisition contractors  who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment 
some of these competitors may have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
suppliers we have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool 
we acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from sercel 
however  we also acquire lease pool equipment from a number of other suppliers including ion and geospace 
management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory and that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative agreements in the event of interruption of supply 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from sercel 
for additional information regarding the risk associated with our suppliers  see item a risk factors 
employees as of january   we employed approximately people full time  none of whom were represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our employee relations to be satisfactory 
intellectual property the products designed  manufactured and sold by our seamap segment utilize significant intellectual property that we have developed or have licensed from others 
our internally developed intellectual property consists of product designs and trade secrets 
we currently have no patents covering any of this intellectual property

table of contents environmental regulation we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations pertaining to worker safety and health  protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes are handled and wastes generated from such operations are disposed 
we have established and implemented proactive environmental procedures for the management of these chemicals and materials as well as the handling and recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits for regulated activities  specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection  capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges  and more stringent precautions for disposal of certain wastes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigating or remedial obligations  and the issuance of injunctive relief 
spills or releases of chemicals  other regulated materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations where they are transported for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability  which may be strict  joint and several  for the costs of cleaning up chemicals  other regulated materials and wastes released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by such spills or releases 
as a result of such actions  we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes  remediate environmental contamination  and undertake measures to prevent future contamination 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
for instance  the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to climate change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon based fuels or with regard to hydraulic fracturing that have the effect of decreasing the performance of oil or natural gas exploration or production activities by energy companies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
moreover  the implementation of new or more restrictive regulatory initiatives in response to significant spills by oil and natural gas operators  such as occurred following the deepwater horizon incident in the us gulf of mexico in april  may delay or decrease the pace of exploration or production activities  which may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are also subject to federal and state occupational safety and health laws whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers and whose implementing regulations and standards obligate us to organize and or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and to provide this information to employees  state and legal governmental authorities and citizens 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that this trend of compliance and avoidance of material costs or other liabilities will continue in the future

risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this form k 
the risk factors described below are not the only risks we face 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may also be affected by additional factors that are not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial or that are not specific to us  such as general economic conditions 
you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements included under cautionary statements about forward looking statements of this form k 
all forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below 
if economic conditions weaken or commodity prices become depressed or decline  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
historically  the demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by oil and gas companies 
during the period of depressed commodity prices  such as that experienced in late and  many oil and gas exploration and production companies significantly reduced their levels of capital spending  including amounts dedicated to the leasing or purchasing our seismic equipment 
factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include  among other things the level of supply and demand for oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  for oil and natural gas  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  worldwide political  military and economic conditions  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to set and maintain production levels and prices for oil  the rate of discovery of new oil and gas reserves and the decline of existing oil and gas reserves  the cost of exploring for  developing and producing oil and natural gas  the ability of exploration and production companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration  development and production operations  technological advances affecting energy exploration  production and consumption  government policies  including environmental regulations and tax policies  regarding the exploration for  production and development of oil and natural gas reserves and the use of fossil fuels and alternative energy sources  and weather conditions  including large scale weather events such as hurricanes that impact oil and gas operations over a wide area or impact prices 
a return of depressed commodity prices  or a decline in existing commodity prices  could adversely affect demand for the services and equipment we provide  and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
further  perceptions of a long term decrease in commodity prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our statement of financial position if they are determined to cause impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets or of our other long lived assets 

table of contents demand for seismic data is not assured 
demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by oil and gas prices and industry expectations of future price levels  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the availability of current geophysical data  the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration operations  the granting of leases or exploration concessions and the expiration of such rights  changes to existing laws and regulations  domestic and foreign tax policies  merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers  expected rates of declining current production  technical advances affecting energy exploration  production  transportation and consumption  weather conditions  including hurricanes and monsoons that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic acquisition surveys  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  oil and natural gas prices  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated significantly 
these fluctuations have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in a given financial period 
projects awarded to and scheduled by our customers can be delayed or cancelled due to factors that are outside of their control  which can affect the demand for our products and services 
these factors include the following inclement weather conditions  difficulties in obtaining permits and licenses  labor or political unrest  delays in obtaining land access rights  availability of required equipment  security concerns  budgetary or financial issues of oil and gas companies  and delays in payments to our customers from their oil and gas company clients 

table of contents a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one of these customers could harm our results of operations 
we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in fiscal  and  cgv  our single largest customer  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
together  our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in fiscal there has been consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue 
this consolidation could result in the loss of one or more of our customers and could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment 
the financial soundness of our customers could materially affect our business and operating results 
if our customers experience financial difficulties or their own customers delay payment to them  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us 
disruptions in the financial markets  such as those that occurred in  or other macro economic issues could exacerbate financial difficulties for our customer 
any inability of customers to pay us for services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as of january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and contracts receivable  of which approximately million was over days past due 
for fiscal and we had net charges of approximately million and million  respectively  to our provision for doubtful accounts 
in fiscal we experienced recoveries of amounts previously considered uncollectable 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
due to the international scope of our business activities  our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
many of our foreign operations are conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
those currencies include the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the singapore dollar  the russian ruble and the british pound sterling 
these internationally sourced revenues are subject to the risk of taxation policies  expropriation  political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other geopolitical hazards as well as foreign currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars and fluctuations 
for example  for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of our operating subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has in the past been  and may in the future be  material because of the significant amount of assets held by our international subsidiaries and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales  which pose additional risks 
we conduct operations on a global scale 
for fiscal  and approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were attributable to operations in foreign countries 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent to any business operating in foreign countries  and especially those with emerging markets 
as we continue to increase our presence in such countries  our operations will encounter the following risks  among others government instability  which can cause investment in capital projects by our potential clients to be withdrawn or delayed  reducing or eliminating the viability of some markets for our services  potential expropriation  seizure  nationalization or detention of assets  
table of contents difficulty in repatriating foreign currency received in excess of local currency requirements  import export quotas  civil uprisings  riots and war  which can make it unsafe to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose us to losses  availability of suitable personnel and equipment  which can be affected by government policy  or changes in policy  which limit the importation of qualified crewmembers or specialized equipment in areas where local resources are insufficient  decrees  laws  regulations  interpretation and court decisions under legal systems  which are not always fully developed and which may be retroactively applied and cause us to incur unanticipated and or unrecoverable costs as well as delays which may result in real or opportunity costs  and terrorist attacks  including kidnappings of our personnel  political and economic uncertainties in certain countries which cause delays or cancellation of oil and gas exploration projects  and environmental concerns and regulations in some countries 
we cannot predict the nature and the likelihood of any such events 
however  if any of these or other similar events should occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation 
certain of the seismic equipment that we use in certain foreign countries may require prior us government approval in the form of an export license and may otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
the delay in obtaining required governmental approvals could affect our ability to timely commence a project  and the failure to comply with all such controls could result in fines and other penalties 
we are subject to taxation in many foreign jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide 
our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities  and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest 
our overall success as a global business depends  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing economic  social and political conditions 
we may not continue to succeed in developing and implementing policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we do business  which could negatively affect our profitability 
as a company subject to compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa and the uk bribery act of the uk bribery act  our business may suffer because our efforts to comply with these laws could restrict our ability to do business in foreign markets relative to our competitors who are not subject to them 
any determination that we or our foreign agents or partners have violated the fcpa or the uk bribery act may adversely affect our business and operations 
we and our local partners operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and  in certain circumstances  strict compliance with anti bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices 
we may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business  licenses or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or using other methods that us law and regulations prohibit us from using 
as a us corporation  we are subject to the regulations imposed by the fcpa  which generally prohibits us companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or keeping business 
in particular  we may be held liable for actions taken by our strategic or local partners even though our partners are not subject to the fcpa 
any such violations could result in substantial 
table of contents civil and or criminal penalties and might adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  our ability to continue to work in such foreign markets could be adversely affected if we were found to have violated certain us laws  including the fcpa 
the uk bribery act  which became effective in  is broader in scope than the fcpa and applies to public and private sector corruption and contains no facilitating payments exception 
capital requirements for our operations can be large 
if we are unable to finance these requirements  we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage 
we have historically funded our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations  cash reserves  issuance of common stock and short term borrowings from commercial banks 
our working capital requirements continue to increase  primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for more recording channels  which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images 
if we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow  or current demand or pricing of our services were to decrease substantially or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain  additional financing could be required 
access to global financial markets and the terms under which capital is available can be uncertain and volatile 
this was evident during the global financial crisis that arose in furthermore  due to the historically cyclical nature of the energy business in general  and the seismic industry in particular  capital for businesses in this industry can be even more difficult and expensive to obtain 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding will be available if and when needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to grow our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts 
our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of two to six months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment on the initial lease 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lease customers are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other customers after the termination of the original leases  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the high fixed costs of our operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
our business has high fixed costs  which primarily consist of depreciation expenses associated with our lease pool of seismic data acquisition equipment 
in periods of significant downtime these fixed costs do not decline as rapidly as our revenues 
as a result  any significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents our long lived assets may be subject to impairment 
we periodically assess our long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets and our lease pool of equipment  for impairment 
if we expect significant sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices in the future  we may be required to write down the value of these assets if the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related assets falls below net book value 
declines in oil and natural gas prices  if sustained  could result in future impairments 
if we are forced to write down the value of our long lived assets  these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded 
see the discussion included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies long lived assets 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence 
we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers  which could affect our ability to compete as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
recently  seismic equipment manufacturers have introduced wireless  or cable free  recording systems 
many seismic contractors believe that wireless recording systems offer significant operational advantages over traditional cable based systems  particularly in certain environments 
some seismic contractors have made significant investment in wireless technology and have replaced much of their cable based equipment 
should other contractors take this approach  it could accelerate the obsolescence of much of our lease pool of equipment 
as of january  we have approximately  channels of ground recording equipment in our lease pool  of which approximately  channels are wireless  or cable free  systems  manufactured by sercel and geospace 
historically  there have been three major seismic equipment suppliers  sercel  inova and geospace 
each of these companies currently offer wireless recording systems 
however  we believe that at least five other companies are currently offering or developing similar products 
should one of the competing systems gain wide spread acceptance among seismic contractors  it could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our current lease pool of equipment 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to acquire the types of equipment that would then be in demand by our customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
seasonal conditions cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our lease revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in leasing revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada and russia from january through march or april 
this seasonal pattern may cause our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities 
we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenues from the lease and sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 

table of contents we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations 
we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
should our relationships with our suppliers deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these events could adversely affect our future results of operations 
the majority of our lease pool equipment is produced by sercel and has been acquired by us pursuant to a series of agreements  see item business key supplier agreements 
for fiscal  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from sercel 
if we are not able to continue our past relationship with sercel we may not be able to acquire equipment under terms as favorable as in the past  which could adversely affect our future results of operations 
equipment in our lease pool may be subject to the intellectual property claims of others that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the lease of the equipment 
certain of the equipment in our lease pool is proprietary to us 
the equipment we acquired with the acquisition of aes  see item business  includes heli pickers and associated equipment that is manufactured by aes and is subject to various patents  see item business intellectual property 
we also have some equipment in our lease pool that is manufactured by our seamap segment  which is subject to intellectual property rights and protection as discussed below 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent us from leasing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
additionally  the equipment that we acquire from other suppliers may be subject to the intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
we generally are indemnified by our suppliers against any claims that may be brought against us by third parties related to equipment they sold to us 
however  such claims could affect our ability to acquire additional such products or to lease them in the future 
the loss of this future revenue could adversely affect our business and would not generally be covered by the indemnities from our suppliers 
in february  ion obtained a judgment against sercel as a result of a patent infringement suit 
in february this judgment was affirmed by the appellate court 
one aspect of the judgment restricts the importation and use of certain seismic equipment in the united states  including sercel s xl dsu products 
we currently own a significant amount of this equipment and may purchase additional amounts from sercel or others in the future 
we believe that a significant portion of this equipment that we currently own is not subject to any restrictions as to use in the united states 
however  if we are unable to import into or use in the united states any portion of this equipment our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to compete for certain projects located in the united states 
in addition  the administrative and operational effort required to ensure that no restricted equipment is brought into the united states may cause our costs to increase 

table of contents in august  ion was found guilty of patent infringement in a suit brought against it by westerngeco llc the matters at issue in this case involve certain technology used to steer marine streamers and certain products manufactured and sold by ion 
we own at least one of these products in our lease pool 
it is our understanding that this verdict  if upheld upon any appeal  could negatively impact the ability of our customers to utilize the technology at issue and therefore could have an adverse effect on the demand for the related products in our lease pool 
the operations of seamap are subject to special risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the design and manufacturing operations of our seamap segment are subject to risks not associated with our equipment leasing business 
these risks include the following risks associated with intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our design information  documentation and other proprietary information 
these intellectual property protection measures may not be sufficient to prevent wrongful misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect proprietary information could result in  among other things  loss of competitive advantage  loss of customer orders and decreased revenues 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  require us to redesign the products that use the technology  and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful 
risks related to product performance 
the production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability or quality problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking the manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense  
table of contents high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 
although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there may be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
risks related to raw materials 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to design and test our products 
certain components used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of vendors 
if these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us  or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components  these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues  materials shortages  excess demand  reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us  thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships 
some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who  from time to time  may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements 
many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors  thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components 
if our supply arrangements are interrupted  we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources  reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers 
a delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
failures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products  can reduce customer confidence in our products  and may adversely affect our financial performance 
from time to time  we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business 
in addition  a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses that affect their ability to meet our supply demands could adversely impact the availability of components that we depend on 
delayed deliveries from these sources could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could increase our costs of compliance and impose significant liabilities 
we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations relating to worker safety and health  protection of the environment and the handling of chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the recycling and disposal of wastes generated by those processes 
these laws and regulations may impose joint and several strict liability and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of investigatory remedial obligations  and 
table of contents issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations 
these laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits to conduct regulated activities  install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies  conduct remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater  implement specific health and safety criteria for worker protection  or undertake measures to prevent future contamination or incur other significant environmental related expenses 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
we anticipate that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental laws and regulations will continue  the occurrence of which may require us to increase our capital expenditures or could result in increased operating expenses  in addition to possibly decreasing the performance of exploration or production activities by energy companies  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas  thereby adversely affecting our business  while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases ghgs present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
based on these findings  the epa adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal clean air act that establish significant deterioration psd construction and title v operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of ghg emissions 
this stationary source rule tailors these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to reduce those emissions according to best available control technology standards for ghg that will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
in addition the epa has adopted regulations requiring the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions from specified sources in the united states  including  among others  certain onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities on an annual basis 
while the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs  there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce ghg emissions at the federal level in recent years 
in the absence of such federal climate legislation  a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and or reducing ghg emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of ghg emissions  such as electric power plants  to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those ghgs 
if congress undertakes comprehensive tax reform in the coming year  it is possible that such reform may include a carbon tax  which could impose additional direct costs on operations and reduce demand for refined products 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address ghg emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations that require reporting of ghgs or otherwise limit emissions of ghgs from oil and gas exploration and production activities could have an adverse effect on the demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could adversely affect or delay our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted surface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions  but the epa has 
table of contents asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving the use of diesel fuels and published draft permitting guidance in may addressing the performance of such activities using diesel fuels 
in november  the epa announced its intent to develop and issue regulations under the toxic substances control act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and the agency currently plans to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking that would seek public input on the design and scope of such disclosure regulations pursuant to the federal safe drinking water act sdwa 
in addition  congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process 
at the state level  several states have adopted or are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting  public disclosure  and or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities 
if new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such legal requirements could make it more difficult to complete natural gas wells in certain formations and adversely affect demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
in addition  certain governmental reviews are either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the white house council on environmental quality is coordinating an administration wide review of hydraulic fracturing practices 
the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater  with initial results made available on december  and final results expected to be available by  and has further announced plans to develop effluent limitations for the treatment and discharge of wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities by other governmental agencies  including the us department of energy and the us department of the interior  have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing 
these ongoing or proposed studies  depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained  could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the sdwa or other regulatory mechanisms  which could have an adverse effect on the demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
more comprehensive and stringent regulation in the us gulf of mexico in the aftermath of the macondo well oil spill may result in increased costs and delays in offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operations  which could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
following an april  fire and explosion aboard the deepwater horizon drilling rig and resulting oil spill from the macondo well operated by a third party in ultra deep water in the us gulf of mexico  there have been a series of regulatory initiatives developed and implemented at the federal level to address the direct impact of the incident and to prevent similar incidents in the future 
beginning in and continuing through  the federal government  acting through the us department of the interior doi and its implementing agencies that have since evolved into the present day bureau of ocean energy management boem and bureau of safety and environmental enforcement bsee  have issued a variety of regulations and notices to lessees and operators ntls intended to impose additional safety  permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration  development and production activities in the us gulf of mexico 
these regulatory initiatives effectively slowed down the pace of drilling and production operations in the us gulf of mexico as adjustments were being made in operating procedures  certification requirements and lead times for inspections  drilling applications and permits  and exploration and production plan reviews  and as the federal agencies evolved into their present day bureaus 
under the doi s current organizational format  the boem administers offshore leasing  resource evaluation  oil and natural gas exploration and production plan reviews  renewable energy development  national environmental policy act analyses  and environmental studies whereas the bsee manages responsibility for the safety and enforcement functions imposed on offshore oil and natural gas operations  including the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations  permitting of offshore exploration  development and production activities  inspections  offshore regulatory programs  oil spill response and compliance programing and training 
offshore oil and natural gas exploration and production operators are now required to comply with this more comprehensive and stringent array of legal requirements as conditions to initiating and or continuing 
table of contents offshore activities in the us gulf of mexico  compliance with which has made it more difficult and costly in proceeding with those activities and more prone to potential delays  whether due to permit delays  the aggregate effect of more regulation  the need for new or retrofitted equipment or processes or qualified personnel  or otherwise 
in addition to the array of new or revised safety  permitting and certification requirements developed and implemented by the doi in the past few years  there have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations that could affect offshore development and production such as  for example  a proposal to significantly increase the minimum financial responsibility demonstration required under the oil pollution act opa 
to the extent that the existing regulatory initiatives implemented and pursued over the past few years or any future restrictions  whether through legislative or regulatory means or increased or broadened enforcement programs  lead to an increase in the cost of operations in offshore waters or foster uncertainties or delays in offshore oil and natural gas exploration  production or development activities  then such conditions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our business could be negatively affected by security threats  including cybersecurity threats  and other disruptions 
we face various security threats  including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable  threats to the security of our facilities  and threats from terrorist acts 
the potential for such security threats subjects our operations to increased risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in particular  our implementation of various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate security threats and to increase security for our information  facilities and infrastructure may result in increased capital and operating costs 
moreover  there can be no assurance that such procedures and controls will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring 
if any of these security breaches were to occur  they could lead to losses of sensitive information  critical infrastructure or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cybersecurity attacks in particular are becoming more sophisticated and include  but are not limited to  malicious software  attempts to gain unauthorized access to data  and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems  unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information  and corruption of data 
these events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions  loss of business or potential liability 
we may grow through acquisitions and our failure to properly plan and manage those acquisitions may adversely affect our performance 
we plan to expand not only through organic growth  but may also do so through the strategic acquisition of companies and assets 
we must plan and manage any acquisitions effectively to achieve revenue growth and maintain profitability in our evolving market 
if we fail to manage acquisitions effectively  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our personnel  management and other resources 
we must continue to improve our operational  financial  management  legal compliance and information systems to keep pace with the growth of our business 
any future acquisitions could present a number of risks  including but not limited to incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of acquired operations or assets or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring operations or assets  failure to integrate the operations or management of any acquired operations or assets successfully and timely  diversion of management s attention from existing operations or other priorities  and our inability to secure sufficient financing  on terms we find acceptable  that may be required for any such acquisition or investment 

table of contents our stock price is subject to volatility 
energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been volatile from time to time 
stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing 
in addition to the other risk factors discussed in this section  the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  factors influencing the levels of global oil and natural gas exploration and exploitation activities  such as depressed prices for natural gas in north america or disasters such as the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico in  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors or analysts consider comparable to us  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions  such as interest rates  commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets 
to the extent that the price of our common stock remains at lower levels or it declines further  our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity or otherwise use our common stock as consideration will be reduced 
in addition  increases in our leverage may make it more difficult for us to access additional capital 
these factors may limit our ability to implement our operating and growth plans 
we have significant operations outside of the united states that expose us to certain additional risks 
we operate in a number of foreign locations and have subsidiaries or branches in foreign countries  including russia  peru and colombia 
our equipment is also often temporarily located in other foreign locations while under rent by our customers 
these operations expose us to political and economic risks and uncertainties 
should current circumstances change  we could encounter difficulties in operating in some countries and may not be able to retrieve our equipment that is located within these counties 
this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions and results of operations 
because we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available  our financial condition  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 
provisions in our articles of incorporation and texas law could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business organizations code may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any 
table of contents series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock 
although we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in two segments  equipment leasing and seamap 
our equipment leasing operations are conducted from our huntsville  texas headquarters and from our locations in calgary  canada  brisbane  australia  lima  peru  bogota  colombia  budapest  hungary  singapore and ufa  russia 
this includes the operations of our mcl  sap  mel  mml and mse subsidiaries and our branches in peru and colombia 
mel and mml were formed in late fiscal accordingly  the first full year of operations for these subsidiaries was fiscal and they did not contribute materially to our revenues prior to january  seamap operates from its locations near bristol  united kingdom and in singapore 
management believes that the performance of our equipment leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment 
management further believes that the performance of our seamap segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales 
management monitors ebitda and adjusted ebitda  both as defined in the following table  as key indicators of our overall performance and liquidity 

table of contents the following table presents certain operating information by operating segment years ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing seamap less inter segment sales total revenues cost of sales equipment leasing seamap less inter segment costs total direct costs gross profit equipment leasing seamap less inter segment amounts total gross profit operating expenses general and administrative recovery of provision for doubtful accounts depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income ebitda adjusted ebitda reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda net income interest expense  net depreciation  amortization and impairment benefit provision for income taxes gain from bargain purchase ebitda stock based compensation adjusted ebitda reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to ebitda net cash provided by operating activities stock based compensation provision for doubtful accounts changes in trade accounts and contracts receivable interest paid taxes paid  net of refunds gross profit from sale of lease pool equipment changes in contract revenues in excess of billings changes in inventory changes in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities other ebitda 
table of contents ebitda is defined as net income before a interest income and interest expense  b provision for or benefit from income taxes and c depreciation  amortization and impairment 
adjusted ebitda excludes stock based compensation 
we consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be important indicators for the performance of our business  but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we have included these non gaap financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity  and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures  service debt and finance working capital requirements 
the covenants of our revolving credit agreement require us to maintain a minimum level of ebitda 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us 
in particular  we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities 
we believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
in evaluating our performance as measured by ebitda  management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes  interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures 
accordingly  editda and adjusted ebitda are only two of the measurements that management utilizes 
other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda or adjusted ebitda differently than we do and ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
in our equipment leasing segment  we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements 
all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
we acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our seamap segment 
these amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our seamap segment  less accumulated depreciation 
from time to time  we sell lease pool equipment to our customers 
these sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business 
additionally  when equipment that has been leased to a customer is lost or destroyed  the customer is charged for such equipment at amounts specified in the underlying lease agreement 
these charges are included in lease pool equipment sales in the accompanying financial statements 
we occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
we produce and sell  as well as lease  equipment used to deploy and retrieve seismic equipment with helicopters 
in addition to leasing seismic equipment  sap sells equipment  consumable supplies  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
our seamap segment designs  manufactures and sells a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic applications 
seamap s primary products include the i gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools  and ii the buoylink rgps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
accordingly  our first and fourth quarters have historically produced higher leasing revenues than the second and third quarters 
in other areas of the world  periods of heavy rain can impair seismic operations 
these periods of inclement weather can impact our results of operations  however  there is no historical trend as to the timing of such impact 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization  see item a risk factors 

table of contents business outlook our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which  in turn  are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
land seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews  known as channel count 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
during fiscal  we experienced a significant increase in our equipment leasing business 
we believe the factors contributing to this increase included the following increased exploration activity driven by higher worldwide oil prices  increased exploration activity for natural gas  driven in part by non conventional sources  such as shale reservoirs  our geographic expansion  an increase in the channel count on seismic surveys  and the additions we made to our lease pool of equipment 
particular areas of improved leasing revenues included our latin american  north american and european land operations and our marine leasing business 
we expected these trends to generally continue into fiscal however  they did not and our equipment leasing business declined in fiscal from fiscal levels  but the levels remained above those of fiscal the decline in fiscal from fiscal related primarily to declines in land leasing activity in the united states  latin america and europe 
we do not believe that the decline in our fiscal land leasing activity is indicative of a trend 
as more fully discussed below  we believe that certain specific factors contributed to the fiscal decline and that those factors will not necessarily continue into the future 
however  there can be no assurance of this 
we believe overall demand for seismic services  and for our services  continues to remain strong 
this demand is driven by the world wide demand for oil and gas and the demand for more precise seismic data on the part of oil and gas companies 
also contributing to this demand is the use of seismic data in the development and management of oil and gas properties beyond the exploration phase 
over the past several years  we have made significant additions to our lease pool of equipment  amounting to over million in equipment purchases during the five years ended january  by adding this equipment  we have not only expanded the amount of equipment that we have  but have also increased the geographic prescence of our leasing operations and have expanded the types of equipment that we have in our lease pool 
additions to our lease pool during fiscal  and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
historically  there have been continued improvements and enhancements in seismic equipment  generally driven by competition among two or three major equipment suppliers 
recently  a number of companies have developed  or are developing  seismic recording equipment based on wireless  or cable free technology 
we believe that there are approximately eight companies currently offering or developing such equipment 
we think it is unlikely that all of these products will ultimately prove to be commercially successful 
however  in the meantime  the existence of these products has created a great deal of competition that has had the effect of depressing prices for seismic recording equipment  and specifically recording channels 
while we are the beneficiary of lower prices for equipment we purchase  the current equipment pricing environment also exerts 
table of contents pressure on our rental rates 
we cannot at this time determine the effect of this pressure  if any  on our results of operations 
we currently have within our lease pool of equipment wireless recording channels from two different manufacturers 
depending upon the demand from our customers  we may add additional wireless equipment to our lease pool in the future 
the market for products sold by seamap and the demand for the leasing of marine seismic equipment is dependent upon activity within the offshore  or marine  seismic industry  including the re fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels 
seamap has enjoyed increases in revenues over the past three fiscal years 
our seamap business has benefited from equipping new build vessels and from re equipping older vessels with newer  more efficient technology 
in addition  as seamap has expanded its installed base of products  our business for replacements  spare parts  repair and support services has expanded 
certain existing and potential customers continue to express interest in our gunlink and buoylink products 
some of this interest involves the upgrade of exiting gunlink and buoylink products to newer versions or systems with greater functionality 
we believe the marine seismic market continues to be strong  as indicated by the expansion of various marine seismic contractors  including the addition of new vessels to their fleets 
we also have expanded the geographic breadth of our operations by acquiring or establishing operating facilities in new locations 
in fiscal  we established new leasing subsidiaries in hungary and in singapore and significantly expanded the operations of our branch in colombia 
we may seek to expand our operations in to additional locations in the future either through establishing green field operations or by acquiring other businesses 
however  we do not currently have specific plans to establish any such operations 
the oil and gas industry  in general  and the seismic industry  in particular  have historically been cyclical businesses 
if worldwide oil and gas prices should decline from current levels  or if the expectations for future prices should change  we could see a material change in the level of our business 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources 
for fiscal  and  revenues from international customers totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian  canadian and singapore dollars and russian rubles 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years  except as described above 
results of operations for fiscal  we recorded operating income of approximately million  compared to approximately million for fiscal and approximately million for fiscal the decrease in fiscal relates primarily to decreased leasing revenues and increased lease pool depreciation 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal reflects increased leasing revenue associated with the improved demand for seismic equipment 
the gross profit for our equipment leasing segment was approximately million in fiscal  compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the decrease between fiscal and fiscal resulted from lower leasing revenues and higher lease pool depreciation expense 
the increase between fiscal and fiscal resulted from higher leasing revenues and increased sales of lease pool equipment 
the increase was despite increased direct operating costs and depreciation expense related to our lease pool of equipment 
our seamap segment recorded gross profit of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in gross profit were due primarily to increased revenues 
seamap revenues increased in each of these years as customers continued to buy new equipment in order to enhance efficiency by upgrading technology 
the improvement in revenues is also due in part to on going support activities from our installed base of these products 

table of contents revenues and cost of sales equipment leasing revenues and cost of sales from our equipment leasing segment were comprised of the following years ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing lease pool equipment sales new seismic equipment sales sap equipment sales cost of sales lease pool depreciation direct costs equipment leasing cost of lease pool equipment sales cost of new seismic equipment sales cost of sap equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin in fiscal  equipment leasing revenues declined approximately from fiscal levels  due primarily to reduced activity in the united states  latin american and europe as discussed in more detail below and  to a lesser extent  a decline in our down hole leasing revenue as discussed in more detail below 
during fiscal  we benefited from a very large project in the united states that contributed approximately million in leasing revenues 
we had anticipated a follow on project in fiscal  but this did not occur 
very large contracts such as this can occur from time to time  but they cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy 
fiscal equipment leasing revenues in latin america were less than anticipated and less than in fiscal a number of anticipated projects  primarily in colombia  experienced a series of delays due to weather  permitting  regulatory and other logistical issues 
based on discussions with our customers and other industry participants  we believe there is a substantial amount of seismic survey activity pending in latin america and we expect this to be an area of continued strong activity for our leasing business 
however  factors such as those encountered in fiscal could continue to impact our business 
we also experienced a decline in equipment leasing activity in europe in fiscal as compared to fiscal we believe that this decline was caused  in large degree  by economic  political and environmental issues in much of eastern europe 
political unrest in north africa also contributed to this decline  as certain of our customers in eastern europe have operated in north africa in the past 
we have recently seen indications of improved activity among our customers in eastern europe and expect increased activity among these customers in the future 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the effect of this on our equipment leasing business 
during fiscal  revenues from our down hole leasing business declined from that in fiscal the majority of our down hole business has been in north america and relates to microseismic and fracture monitoring programs 
we believe that decreased activity in such programs in north america contributed to this decline 
revenues from our marine leasing business increased in fiscal over fiscal  reflecting  we believe  overall strong fundamentals in the marine seismic market 
however  this increase did not offset the decreases discussed above 

table of contents equipment leasing revenues in fiscal increased by more than over fiscal contributing to the increase was significantly improved demand for land equipment in latin america  north america and europe  as well as increased demand for marine equipment 
we also experienced improved demand during this period for our down hole seismic equipment 
in order to respond to this increased demand  we made significant additions to our lease pool during fiscal and we significantly increased our operations in latin america 
the improved demand was seen across most categories of land equipment  including traditional cabled systems  three component recording systems and cable free recording systems 
from time to time  we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy our capital in other lease pool assets 
these transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and  accordingly  are difficult to predict 
also included in sales of lease pool equipment are charges to leasing customers for lost or destroyed equipment 
lease pool equipment sales increased in fiscal period due to the sale of certain older equipment in a series of transactions 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the lease pool equipment sales amounted to approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal often  the equipment that is sold from our lease pool has been held by us  and therefore depreciated  for some period of time 
accordingly  the equipment sold may have a relatively low net book value at the time of the sale  resulting in a relatively high gross profit from the transaction 
the amount of the gross profit on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment 
occasionally  we sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers  and we regularly sell equipment that we produce for use in deploying and retrieving seismic equipment by helicopter 
often  the sales of new seismic equipment are structured with a significant down payment  with the balance financed over a period of time at a market rate of interest 
in fiscal and  essentially all sales of new seismic equipment relate to sales of heli transport equipment 
in fiscal  in addition to sales of heli transport equipment  we sold a new recording system to a new customer in europe 
the gross profit from new seismic equipment sales amounted to approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal  and million in fiscal the gross profit in fiscal  as a percent of sales  was less than that in fiscal and due to the lower gross profit from the sale of the new recording system in that year 
sap regularly sells new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in australia and throughout the pacific rim 
contributing to the increase in sap equipment sales during the three year period ended january  was increased demand from various entities throughout southeast asia 
the gross profit from the sale of new seismic  hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by sap amounted to approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and  in fiscal lease pool depreciation expense for fiscal amounted to approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in depreciation expense in each of the periods resulted from the significant additions to our lease pool of equipment that we have made in recent periods  including approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal we begin to depreciate new equipment when that equipment is first deployed on a rental contract 
the equipment is then depreciated on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
the useful lives of our assets range from three to seven years 
in april  we purchased approximately million of used equipment 
the majority of this equipment was not deployed on a contract until january  however  because the equipment was used  we began to depreciate it immediately upon the purchase 
at january   lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately million were fully depreciated  yet remained in service 
this compares to million at january  these assets  though fully depreciated  are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity 
we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  repairs and sublease expense 
fiscal and direct costs equipment leasing included costs related to the repositioning of equipment to areas of higher demand  specifically russia and latin america  and the cost to sub lease certain equipment in response to specific demand 

table of contents seamap revenues and cost of sales for our seamap segment were as follows years ended january  in thousands equipment sales cost of equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin demand for seamap s products is generally dependent upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity 
a large portion of seamap s sales consist of large discrete orders  the timing of which is dictated by our customers 
this timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed 
accordingly  there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another that does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products 
we believe that we have continued to experience relatively strong demand for seamap s products because operators of marine seismic vessels have been adding newly built vessels to replace older  less efficient vessels and have been upgrading technology on remaining vessels in order to improve operating efficiency 
during fiscal  we delivered four gunlink units and four buoylink units  as compared to five and seven units  respectively  in fiscal and four and seven units  respectively  in fiscal as we have increased our installed base of gunlink and buoylink  as well as other products  we have generated increased revenues from the sale of spare parts  repairs and support services 
as of january   seamap had a backlog of approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of january  and million as of january  we expect that all orders included in backlog as of january  will be completed during fiscal based on our experience  we do not believe backlog as of a particular date is necessarily indicative of future results 
the gross profit margin from the sales of seamap equipment was comparable in each of the last three fiscal years  as production levels were approximately the same in each period and our production operations in singapore remained stable 
in each of the last three fiscal years  we have been able to plan production and purchasing activities efficiently due to good visibility of the delivery requirements of our customers 
operating expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to approximately million  compared to approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in each of these years reflects the generally higher level of operations  particularly the cost associated with our expanded operations in latin america  singapore and europe 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses represented approximately   and of revenues in each of the three years ended january   respectively 
components of the higher expenses include compensation costs related to increases in headcount  travel costs and professional fees 
during fiscal  we recovered approximately  in accounts receivable that had previously been deemed uncollectable 
during fiscal and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts  net of recoveries  in the amount of approximately  and million  respectively 
in fiscal  we provided approximately million for estimated uncollectable accounts and recovered approximately million from amounts that had been previously provided 
the majority of these recoveries related to a particular customer who had defaulted on a contract and for which we had foreclosed on and recovered certain equipment 
in addition to the value of the recovered equipment  we received a cash distribution from the bankruptcy of that customer and a cash settlement from our insurance carrier 
at january  and  we had trade accounts and note receivables over days past due of approximately million and million  respectively 
in our industry  and in our experience  it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is 
table of contents not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization  other than lease pool depreciation  relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture  fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of seamap 
other income and expense we completed the acquisition of aes on march  the fair value of the assets and liabilities we acquired  as determined by a third party appraisal  exceeded the total consideration we paid by approximately million 
accordingly  pursuant to the provisions of asc  we recorded a gain from the bargain purchase as of the acquisition date during fiscal other income and expense fiscal includes expense of approximately  related to an expected earn out payment to the former owners of aes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements 
interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
interest expense decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a lower interest rate under our revolving credit facility 
other income and expense relates almost exclusively to net foreign exchange losses and gains  other than as noted above 
these gains and losses resulted primarily from transactions of our foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in us dollars 
these transactions resulted in net transaction losses of approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal  compared to net transaction gains of approximately  in fiscal provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes in fiscal is a benefit of approximately million 
this benefit results from the settlement with the canadian revenue authority and the internal revenue service regarding our request for competent authority assistance for matters arising from an audit of our canadian income tax returns for the years ended january   and due to the settlement  we recognized the benefit of certain tax positions and reversed previous estimates of potential penalties and interest 
the total estimated benefit arising from the settlement and related matters amounted to approximately million 
without this benefit our provision for income taxes for fiscal would have been approximately million  which is an effective rate of approximately 
this effective rate is less than the us statutory rate for the period of due to the effect of earnings taxed in foreign jurisdiction with lower tax rates and certain permanent differences in certain of those jurisdictions related primarily to the depreciable basis of assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately million  which represents an effective tax rate of approximately 
the effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate of for that period primarily due to earnings that are taxed in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
this rate differs from the us statutory rate of for this period due primarily to the effect of earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions  offset by estimated penalties and interest related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities  our revolving credit agreement and  in fiscal  a public offering of common stock 
the principal factor that has affected our cash flow from operating activities is the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above 

table of contents we believe that our liquidity needs for the next months will be met from cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds of our existing working capital facility  taking into account the possible restrictions on funds from our foreign subsidiaries 
however  should our needs for liquidity increase  such as for the purchase of additional lease pool equipment or to make an acquisition  we may seek to issue other debt or equity securities 
we have on file with the sec a shelf registration statement pursuant to which we may issue from time to time up to million in common stock  warrants  preferred stock  debt securities or any combination thereof under the shelf registration statement 
we currently have no plans to issue any such securities 
the following table sets forth selected historical information regarding cash flows from our consolidated statements of cash flows years ended january  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents as of january   we had working capital of approximately million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  as compared to working capital of approximately million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at january  our working capital increased from january  to january  primarily due to working capital generated by operations and was partially offset by purchases of lease pool equipment 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities were net income of million and non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization totaling approximately million and stock based compensation of approximately million 
these were offset by non operating cash items including the gross profit from the sale of lease pool equipment of approximately million and tax related items totaling approximately million 
the net change in other current assets and liabilities increased net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal by approximately million 
the most significant item contributing to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was an increase in trade accounts and contracts receivable of approximately million 
cash flows from investing activities 
in fiscal  and  we acquired approximately million  million and million  respectively  of new lease pool equipment  however  the cash expenditures for these purchases did not all occur within those respective periods 
as of january   our accounts payable included approximately million related to lease pool purchases 
as of january   the amount in accounts payable related to lease pool purchases was approximately million  while the comparable amount as of january  was approximately million 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal  and indicated purchases of equipment held for lease of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to continue adding to our lease pool of equipment during fiscal  but do not currently believe those additions will be at the same level as fiscal we currently estimate that lease pool purchase during fiscal will be between approximately million and million 
cash flows from investing activities for each of fiscal   and reflect proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of used lease pool equipment 
we generally do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment  however  from time to 
table of contents time we will do so in response to particular customer demand 
in determining whether or not to sell lease pool equipment  we weigh expected future leasing revenues from that equipment versus the potential proceeds that may be received upon the sale of the equipment 
during fiscal  we paid approximately million in cash consideration for the aes acquisition 
cash flows from financing activities 
in order to finance our increased purchases of lease pool equipment in fiscal  as discussed above  we issued  shares of our common stock in a public offering 
the offering was completed in june and resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
historically  we generally have financed our purchases of lease pool equipment with cash flow from operations and from proceeds from our revolving credit facility 
however  due to the amount and timing of the increased purchases  we determined to raise additional equity capital to finance these purchases 
included within financing activities are net payments on our revolving line of credit of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  we had net proceeds from borrowings under the line of credit totaling approximately million 
the proceeds from these borrowings are used primarily to temporarily finance purchases of new lease pool equipment and for working capital 
in fiscal  we entered into a note payable with an equipment supplier in the amount of approximately million in connection with the purchase of certain lease pool equipment 
payments on borrowings in fiscal and fiscal primarily represent installment payments made on this obligation and principal payments on notes issued in connection with the acquisition of aes 
financing activities also include the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
these transactions resulted in cash proceeds of approximately  million and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options in fiscal was due to an increase in the market price of our common stock during this period 
in connection with the temporary importation of our lease pool equipment into some countries we are required to post import bonds with the customs authorities of that country 
these bonds are normally provided by local insurance  surety companies or local banks 
in some cases  the party issuing the bond requires that we post collateral to secure our obligations under the bonds 
as of april   we have provided stand by letters of credit totaling approximately  and have pledged approximately  of bank deposits as security for these type obligations 
in august  we amended our revolving credit facility with first victoria bank the bank as follows increased the amount available for borrowing to million  from million  subject to a borrowing base  extended the maturity of the facility to august   set the interest rate at the prime rate  subject to a floor of  which was the prime rate as of august  the previous rate was the prime rate plus with no floor  increased the amount of available borrowings which can be used to secure letters of credit to million from million  increased the limitation on other allowed debt to million  from million  and allows the guaranty of subsidiary debt of up to million without the prior consent of the bank 
amounts available for borrowing are determined by a borrowing base 
the borrowing base is computed based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible lease pool assets 
based upon a calculation of the borrowing base as of january   we believe million of borrowings under the amended facility were available to us as of that date  less any outstanding amounts as described below 
as of april   we had approximately million outstanding under the facility and  of the facility had been reserved to support outstanding letters of credit 
accordingly  we believe approximately million was available for borrowing under the facility as of that date 
the revolving credit facility is secured by essentially all of our domestic assets 
interest is payable monthly 

table of contents the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain a maximum debt to shareholders equity ratio  maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities ratio and produce quarterly earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of not less than a specified amount 
we are in compliance with all of these covenants as more fully described as follows description of financial covenant required amount actual as of january  or for period then ended ratio of debt to shareholder s equity not more than ratio of current assets to current liabilities not less than quarterly ebitda not less than million million under the terms of the revolving credit facility  we may convert any outstanding balances into a series of month notes 
we do not currently anticipate utilizing this option  but if we were to do so we would be required to make monthly payments to amortize these notes 
as of january   there was million outstanding under this facility 
if we were to convert the entire amount into month notes  our required monthly principal payments would be approximately  we would also be required to make monthly interest payments on the remaining principal balance at the greater of the then prime rate and our average borrowing levels under our revolving credit agreement for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total pursuant to our equipment agreements with sercel  we have agreed to make minimum purchases of certain equipment 
should we fail to make these purchases within the time periods specified  sercel has the right to terminate the agreements 
total remaining agreed purchases under the equipment agreements are estimated to be approximately million through december at january   we had approximately  of non current income taxes payable related to uncertain tax positions 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if ever  these obligations will be paid 
we have determined that the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  other than our branch operations in colombia and peru  have been permanently reinvested outside of the united states 
these permanent investments include the purchase of lease pool equipment by those subsidiaries 
accordingly  while there is generally no legal restriction on the distribution of such earnings  we do not expect to have any such earnings available to satisfy obligations in the united states  such as our revolving credit agreement 
should we in the future distribute these earnings to the united states  such distributions could be subject to foreign withholding taxes in certain cases and would likely result in additional federal income tax obligations in the united states 
as of january   we had deposits in foreign banks equal to approximately million 
approximately million of these deposits can be distributed to the united states to repay inter company indebtedness and therefore do not result in any of the adverse tax consequences discussed above 

table of contents in april  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program whereby we may purchase from time to time up to  shares of our common stock 
we are not obligated to make such purchases and intend to do so only if market conditions warrant and if management determines that such purchase will not adversely affect our ability to conduct our business 
we expect to finance repurchases of our common stock  if any  from a combination of cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence  the useful lives of our lease pool assets and amortizable intangible assets and the impairment assessments of our lease pool and various intangible assets 
other areas where we have made significant estimates include the valuation of stock options  the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets and the assessment of uncertain tax positions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease unless there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the customer is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
in most situations  our customers pay shipping and handling costs directly to the shipping agents 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectability 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally one to two years in duration 
long term project revenue from time to time  sap enters into contracts whereby it assembles and sales certain marine equipment  primarily to governmental entities 
performance under these contracts generally occurs over a period of several months 
revenue and costs related to these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
service agreements seamap provides on going support services pursuant to contracts that generally have a term of months 
we recognize revenue from these contracts over the term of the contract 
in some cases  we will provide support services on a time and material basis 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the services are provided 
for certain new systems that seamap sells  we provide support services for up to months at no additional charge 
any amounts attributable to these support obligations are immaterial 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a detailed review of outstanding receivable balances 
factors considered include the age of the receivable  the payment history of the customer  the general financial condition of the customer and any financial or operational leverage we may have in a particular situation 
we typically do not charge fees on past due accounts  although we reserve the right to do so in most of our contractual arrangements with our customers 
as of january   the average age of our accounts receivable was approximately days 
long lived assets we carry our lease pool of equipment and other property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from two to years 
cables are depreciated over two years  geophones over three years  channel boxes over five to seven years and earth vibrators and other heavy equipment are depreciated over a year period 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life and the life of the lease 
intangible assets are amortized from three to years 
the estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on our experience as to the economic useful life of our products 
we review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment  including technological obsolescence  market demand and actual historical useful service life of our lease pool equipment 
additionally  to the extent information is available publicly  we compare our depreciation policies to those of other companies in our industry for reasonableness 
when we purchase new equipment for our lease pool  we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated  whether or not the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period 
our policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue  then the asset will remain on our books 
however  if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity  then it is removed from our books 
we carry our amortizable intangible assets at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed on a straight line method over the estimated life of the asset 
currently  proprietary rights are amortized over a to year period  while covenants not to compete are amortized over a three year period 
the basis for the proprietary right lives are generally based upon the results of valuation reports commissioned from third parties 
covenants not to compete are amortized over the term of the contract 
we annually assess our lease pool equipment and intangible assets that are subject to amortization for potential impairment 
the assessment determines if  in our opinion  events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
such events or changes in circumstances might include the following a significant decrease in the market price of the asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset  or group of assets  is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss  a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the asset  or group of assets  will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 

table of contents if there is an indication of possible impairment  we test the asset  or group of assets  for recoverability 
recoverability is determined by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets or group of assets to their carrying value 
as of january   we determined that there was no indication of impairment of our long lived assets  including our lease pool of equipment and intangible assets that are subject to amortization 
see item a risk factors 
goodwill all of our goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our seamap segment and we have determined that our seamap segment is the reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we elected to adopt asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic testing for impairment 
asu amends the guidance in fasb accounting standards codification topic asc  intangibles goodwill and other goodwill 
accordingly  as of january   we assessed various qualitative factors to determine if it were more likely than not that fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill 
among the qualitative factors we considered were the following macroeconomic conditions have been generally stable  or improving  over the past months  industry and market conditions within the oil field service industry  in general  and the seismic industry  in particular  have improved over the past months 
this is evidenced by our overall improved financial results  improved financial results for many of our customers and suppliers and increased backlogs reported by many of our customers  the financial performance of the seamap segment in fiscal improved over fiscal  in fiscal  the seamap segment had revenues of approximately million and income before taxes of approximately million  in fiscal  the seamap segment had revenues of approximately million and income before taxes of approximately million  there have been no material events specific to the seamap segment  such as the loss of a major customer  change in management or litigation  there has been no material change in the composition or value of the seamap segment s assets or of its product lines  and the segment has not experienced a material increase in cost for raw materials  labor or other items utilized in the business 
based on the above factors we concluded that  as of january   there was no impairment of goodwill 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the weight we give to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carry forward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  
table of contents future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the following positive indicators the current level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities resulting from historically high prices for oil and natural gas  increasing world demand for oil  our recent history of profitable operations in various jurisdictions  our anticipated positive income in various jurisdictions  and our existing customer relationships 
we also considered the following negative indicators the risk of the world oil supply increasing  thereby depressing the price of oil and natural gas  the risk of decreased global demand for oil  and the potential for increased competition in the seismic equipment leasing and sales business 
based on our evaluation of the evidence  as of january  and  we did not provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we evaluate tax positions taken through a two step process 
in the first step  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
in the second step  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both and 
the evaluation of tax positions and the measurement of the related benefit require significant judgment on the part of management 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is recorded based on the grant date fair value of share based awards 
determining the grant date fair value requires management to make estimates regarding the variables used in the calculation of the grant date fair value 
those variables are the future volatility of our common stock price  the length of time an optionee will hold their options until exercising them the expected term  and the number of options or shares that will be forfeited before they are exercised the forfeiture rate 
we utilize various mathematical models in calculating the variables 
share based compensation expense could be different if we used different models to calculate the variables

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 

table of contents hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates chosen for the following estimated sensitivity analysis are considered to be reasonable near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
however  since it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rate and foreign currency exchange rates  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of foreign locations  which gives rise to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to the extent possible  we attempt to denominate our transactions in foreign locations in us dollars 
for those cases in which transactions are not denominated in us dollars  we are exposed to risk from changes in exchange rates to the extent that non us dollar revenues exceed non us dollar expenses related to those operations 
our non us dollar transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling  russian rubles  canadian dollars  australian dollars and singapore dollars 
as a result of these transactions  we generally hold cash balances that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
at january   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents included foreign currency denominated amounts equivalent to approximately million in us dollars 
a increase in the us dollar as compared to each of these currencies would result in a loss of approximately  in the us dollar value of these deposits  while a decrease would result in an equal amount of gain 
we do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 
some of our foreign operations are conducted through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
we currently have subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  russian ruble  australian dollar and the singapore dollar 
assets and liabilities from these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains or losses are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
approximately of our net assets were impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
during fiscal  the us dollar generally decreased in value versus the above currencies 
as a result of this decline  we have recognized an increase of approximately  in accumulated other comprehensive income  primarily related to changes in the relative exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  euro and  including intercompany transactions the australian dollar 
our subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the us dollar often enter into transactions that are denominated in us dollars  including inter company transactions 
these transactions can result in foreign exchange gains or losses to our subsidiaries that are in turn included in our consolidated results of operations 
these transactions resulted in net transaction losses of approximately  in fiscal and million in fiscal and a net transaction gain of approximately  in fiscal interest rate risk as of january   there was approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
this agreement contains a floating interest rate based on the greater of the prime rate  which was as of january  assuming the outstanding balance remains unchanged  a change of basis points in the prime rate would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately  we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in the past  and have no plans to do so 
do to fluctuating balances in the amount outstanding under this debt agreement we do not believe such arrangements to be cost effective
