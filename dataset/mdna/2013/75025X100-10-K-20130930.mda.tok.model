item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and result of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other information included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a non asset based transportation and logistics services company providing customers domestic and international freight forwarding services and other value added supply chain management services  including customs and property brokerage  order fulfillment  inventory management and warehousing 
we are executing a strategy to expand our operations through a combination of organic growth and the strategic acquisition of non asset based transportation and logistics providers meeting our acquisition criteria 
our first acquisition of airgroup corporation airgroup was completed on january  airgroup  headquartered in bellevue  washington  is a non asset based logistics company providing domestic and international freight forwarding services through a network of independent agent offices across north america 
we continue to seek additional companies as suitable acquisition candidates and have completed seven acquisitions since our acquisition of airgroup 
in november  we acquired certain assets of automotive services group in detroit  michigan to service the automotive industry 
in september  we acquired adcom express  inc d b a adcom worldwide adcom  adding an additional locations across north america and 
table of contents augmenting our overall domestic and international freight forwarding capabilities 
in april  we acquired dba distribution services  inc  d b a distribution by air dba  adding an additional locations across north america  further expanding our physical network and service capabilities 
in december  we acquired the assets and operations of laredo  texas based isla international ltd  isla to serve as our gateway to mexico 
in february  we acquired the assets and operations of new york jfk based brunswicks logistics  inc d b a albs logistics  inc albs  a strategic location for domestic and international logistics services 
in november  we acquired certain assets of los angeles  california based marvir logistics  inc  marvir an independent agent  operating partner since providing domestic and international logistics services 
on december   we acquired international freight systems of oregon  inc ifs an independent operating partner since january providing domestic and international logistics services 
in connection with our acquisition of adcom  we changed the name of airgroup corporation to radiant global logistics  inc to better position our centralized back office operations to service our multi brand network 
today  rgl  through the radiant  airgroup  adcom and dba network brands  has a diversified account base including manufacturers  distributors and retailers using a network of independent carriers through a combination of strategically positioned  company owned and independent agent offices 
our growth strategy continues to focus on both organic growth and growth through acquisitions 
for organic growth  we will focus on strengthening and retaining existing  and expanding new customer agency relationships 
since our acquisition of airgroup in january  we have focused our efforts on the build out of our network of independent agency offices  as well as enhancing our back office infrastructure  transportation and accounting systems 
we also continue to search for targets that fit within our acquisition criteria 
performance metrics our principal source of income is derived from freight forwarding services 
as a freight forwarder  we arrange for the shipment of our customers freight from point of origin to point of destination 
generally  we quote our customers a turnkey cost for the movement of their freight 
our price quote will often depend upon the customer s time definite needs first day through fifth day delivery  special handling needs heavy equipment  delicate items  environmentally sensitive goods  electronic components  etc  and the means of transport motor carrier  air  ocean or rail 
in turn  we assume the responsibility for arranging and paying for the underlying means of transportation 
our transportation revenue represents the total dollar value of services we sell to our customers 
our cost of transportation includes direct costs of transportation  including motor carrier  air  ocean and rail services 
we act principally as the service provider to add value in the execution and procurement of these services to our customers 
our net transportation revenue gross transportation revenue less the direct cost of transportation is the primary indicator of our ability to source  add value and resell services provided by third parties  and is considered by management to be a key performance measure 
in addition  management believes measuring its operating costs as a function of net transportation revenue provides a useful metric  as our ability to control costs as a function of net transportation revenue directly impacts operating earnings 
our operating results will be affected as acquisitions occur 
since all acquisitions are made using the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  our financial statements will only include the results of operations and cash flows of acquired companies for periods subsequent to the date of acquisition 
our gaap based net income will be affected by non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets attributable to completed acquisitions 
under applicable accounting standards  purchasers are required to allocate the total consideration in a business combination to the identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the time of acquisition 
the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is to be allocated to goodwill  which is tested at least annually for impairment 
applicable accounting standards require that we separately 
table of contents account for and value certain identifiable intangible assets based on the unique facts and circumstances of each acquisition 
as a result of our acquisition strategy  our net income will include material non cash charges relating to the amortization of customer related intangible assets and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions 
although these charges may increase as we complete more acquisitions  we believe we will be growing the value of our intangible assets eg  customer relationships 
thus  we believe that earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  is a useful financial measure for investors because it eliminates the effect of these non cash costs and provides an important metric for our business 
further  the financial covenants of our caltius financing are measured against adjusted ebitda which excludes costs related to share based compensation expense  change in contingent consideration  extraordinary items and other non cash charges 
our compliance with the financial covenants of our borrowing arrangements is particularly important given the materiality of these facilities to our day to day operations and overall acquisition strategy 
our debt capacity  subject to the requisite collateral at an advance rate of up to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and  subject to certain sub limits  of eligible accrued but unbilled receivables and eligible foreign accounts receivables  is limited to a multiple of our consolidated ebitda as adjusted as measured on a rolling four quarter basis 
if we fail to comply with these covenants and are unable to secure a waiver or other relief  our financial condition would be materiality weakened and our ability to fund day to day operations would be materially and adversely affected 
accordingly  we intend to employ ebitda and adjusted ebitda as management tools to measure our historical financial performance and as a benchmark for future financial flexibility 
our operating results are also subject to seasonal trends when measured on a quarterly basis 
the impact of seasonality on our business will depend on numerous factors  including the markets in which we operate  holiday seasons  consumer demand and economic conditions 
since our revenue is largely derived from customers whose shipments are dependent upon consumer demand and just in time production schedules  the timing of our revenue is often beyond our control 
factors such as shifting demand for retail goods and or manufacturing production delays could unexpectedly affect the timing of our revenue 
as we increase the scale of our operations  seasonal trends in one area of our business may be offset to an extent by opposite trends in another area 
we cannot accurately predict the timing of these factors  nor can we accurately estimate the impact of any particular factor  and thus we can give no assurance any historical seasonal patterns will continue in future periods 
critical accounting policies accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience regarding to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates that affect our financial statements  the areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition  accruals for the cost of purchased transportation  the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  changes in contingent consideration  accounting for the issuance of shares and share based compensation  the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  and the establishment of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform an annual impairment test for goodwill 
we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount 
after assessing qualitative factors  if further testing is necessary we would go into a step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
we have only one reporting unit 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must 
table of contents perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
we typically perform our annual impairment test effective as of april of each year  unless events or circumstances indicate  an impairment may have occurred before that time 
acquired intangibles consist of customer related intangibles and non compete agreements arising from our acquisitions 
customer related intangibles are amortized using accelerated methods over approximately five years and non compete agreements are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the underlying agreements 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a long lived asset is less than its carrying amount  the asset is considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
when fair values are not available  we estimate fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
as a non asset based carrier we do not own transportation assets 
we generate the major portion of our air and ocean freight revenues by purchasing transportation services from direct asset based carriers and reselling those services to our customers 
based upon the terms in the contract of carriage  revenues related to shipments where we issue a house airway bill or a house ocean bill of lading are recognized at the time the freight is tendered to the direct carrier at origin 
costs related to the shipments are also recognized at this same time based upon anticipated margins  contractual arrangements with direct carriers  and other known factors 
the estimates are routinely monitored and compared to actual invoiced costs 
the estimates are adjusted as deemed necessary by us to reflect differences between the original accruals and actual costs of purchased transportation 
this method generally results in recognition of revenues and purchased transportation costs earlier than the preferred methods under gaap which do not recognize revenue until a proof of delivery is received or which recognize revenue as progress on the transit is made 
our method of revenue and cost recognition does not result in a material difference from amounts that would be reported under such other methods

personnel costs consist of payroll  payroll taxes  benefits and stock compensation expense 
personnel costs were million for the year ended june   an increase of from million for the year ended june  the increase is primarily attributable to a full year of personnel costs related to our acquisitions of isla and albs  and a partial year of personnel costs associated with our marvir and ifs acquisitions  as well as increased head count at the corporate office 
as a percentage of net revenues  personnel costs increased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  selling  general and administrative sg a costs consist primarily of marketing  rent  professional services  insurance and travel expenses 
sg a costs were million for the year ended june   a decrease of from million for the year ended june  the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease 
table of contents in non recurring legal expenses incurred in connection with the isla and albs transactions and the dba litigation  lower bad debt expense  and savings associated with combining our two company owned locations in los angeles 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a costs decreased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization costs were million for the year ended june   an increase of from million for the year ended june  the increase is primarily due to a full year of amortization costs associated with the intangibles for our isla and albs acquisitions  and a partial year of amortization of intangibles for our marvir and ifs acquisitions 
as a percentage of net revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  transition and lease termination costs for the year ended june  represent non recurring operating costs incurred in connection with the relocation of the former dba facility in los angeles to a new location  certain personnel costs that were eliminated in connection with the combination of the historical dba and marvir locations  and a loss on disposal of furniture and equipment and totaled million 
transition and lease termination costs for the year ended june  consist of personnel costs related to employees whose positions were eliminated with our integration of dba into our operations and totaled million 
as a percentage of net revenues  non recurring transition costs increased to for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  change in contingent consideration represents the change in the fair value of contingent consideration due to former shareholders of acquired operations 
the change in both years was primarily attributable to isla and albs not achieving their specified operating objectives and totaled income of million for the year ended june   compared to income of million for the year ended june  as a percentage of net revenues  the change in contingent consideration was for the year ended june   from for the year ended june  income from operations was million for the year ended june   compared to income from operations of million for the year ended june   a increase 
the increase is attributable to several factors  favorable and unfavorable to the company 
net revenues increased million primarily due to incremental revenues of a full year for our isla and albs acquisitions 
agent commission expense was flat as the agent based stores recorded similar results in the current year 
personnel costs increased million primarily due to increased personnel costs associated with a full year of recently acquired company owned stores  isla and albs  as well as a partial year of personnel costs associated with marvir and ifs 
selling  general and administrative decreased million primarily due to a decrease in non recurring legal expenses incurred in connection with the isla and albs transactions and the dba litigation  lower bad debt expense  and savings associated with combining our two company owned locations in los angeles 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to a full year of amortization of intangibles for our isla and albs acquisitions  and a partial year amortization of intangibles for our marvir and ifs acquisitions 
transition costs increased million due to charges incurred in combining our two company owned locations in los angeles compared to transition costs associated with eliminating personnel costs related to employees whose positions were eliminated with our integration of dba into our operations 
change in contingent consideration increased million as a result of former shareholders of acquired operations not achieving their specified operating objectives 
other expense was million for the year ended june   as compared to other expense of million during the year ended june  the increase is primarily associated with interest expense incurred with our acquisitions of isla  offset by the gain on litigation settlement 
as a percentage of net revenues  other expense was for the year ended june   up from for the year ended june  our net income was million for the year ended june   reflecting a increase in results of less than million as compared to net income of million for the year ended june   driven principally by the increased efficiency of leveraging our scalable back office infrastructure  favorable write down of 
table of contents contingent consideration  offset by higher depreciation and amortization costs as well as increased lease termination costs 
driven principally by the increased amortization of intangibles resulting from our recent acquisition activities offset partially by the change from contingent consideration and from the non recurring items identified below 
our net income for the current year also reflected a decrease in results of operations related to greater transition costs associated with the dba transaction for the current year as compared to the prior year period  which had only one quarter of transition costs 
although we do not believe the deterioration in gaap based earnings is reflective of the true earnings power of the business  our near term earnings have and will continue to be negatively impacted as a result of these incremental non cash charges and other non recurring costs including  lost revenue experienced by our los angeles dba office  and the legal expenses incurred in connection with the legal proceedings relating to the dba acquisition  although it is our expectation that some or all of these amounts may be recoverable in our claims brought against the former dba shareholders

ebitda is a non gaap measure of income and does not include the effects of interest and taxes  and excludes the non cash effects of depreciation and amortization on long term assets 
companies have some discretion as to which elements of depreciation and amortization are excluded in the ebitda calculation 
we exclude all depreciation charges related to furniture and equipment  all amortization charges  including amortization of leasehold improvements and other intangible assets 
we then further adjust ebitda to exclude changes in contingent consideration  expenses specifically attributable to acquisitions  extraordinary items  costs related to share based compensation expense  and other non cash charges 
our ability to generate adjusted ebitda ultimately limits the amount of debt that we may carry and is a good indicator of our financial flexibility and capacity to complete additional acquisitions in compliance with the caltius financing 
a violation of this covenant in the caltius financing would greatly limit our financial flexibility  reduce available liquidity  and absent a waiver  could give rise to an event of default under the caltius financing 
for the forgoing reasons  we believe that the caltius financing is material to our operations and that adjusted ebitda is important to an evaluation of our financial condition and liquidity 
while management considers ebitda and adjusted ebitda useful in analyzing our results  it is not intended to replace any presentation included in our consolidated financial statements

credit facility in august  we obtained a new credit facility  consisting of a million revolving credit facility  including a million sublimit to support letters of credit and matures on the earlier of six months prior to the december  maturity of the senior subordinated notes  or august  the credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and other assets of the company and its subsidiaries 
advances under the facility are available to fund future acquisitions  capital expenditures  repurchase of company stock or for other corporate purposes 
borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest  at the company s option  at the bank s base prime rate minus or libor plus 
the rates can be subsequently adjusted based on the company s fixed charge coverage ratio at the lender s base rate plus to or libor plus to 
the credit facility is collateralized by accounts receivable and other assets of the company and its subsidiaries and provides for advances of up to of eligible domestic accounts receivable and  subject to certain sub limits  of eligible accrued but unbilled receivables and eligible foreign accounts receivable 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to in the event that availability is less than million or an event of default was to occur 
the co borrowers of the credit facility include radiant logistics  inc  rgl f k a airgroup corporation  radiant transportation services rts  f k a radiant logistics global services  inc  adcom express  inc d b a adcom worldwide  radiant customs services  inc  dba d b a distribution by air  international freight systems of oregon  inc  radiant off shore holdings llc  green acquisition company  inc

as of august   we have gross availability of million  net of advances and letter of credit reserves of approximately million for approximately million in remaining availability under the credit facility 
table of contents to support future acquisitions and our on going working capital requirements 
we expect to structure acquisitions with certain amounts paid at closing  and the balance paid over a number of years in the form of earn out installments which are payable based upon the future earnings of the acquired businesses payable in cash  stock or some combination thereof 
as we continue to execute our acquisition strategy  we will be required to make significant payments in the future if the earn out installments under our various acquisitions become due 
while we believe that a portion of any required cash payments will be generated by the acquired businesses  we may have to secure additional sources of capital to fund the remainder of any cash based earn out payments as they become due 
this presents us with certain business risks relative to the availability of capacity under our credit facility  the availability and pricing of future fund raising  as well as the potential dilution to our stockholders to the extent the earn outs are satisfied directly  or indirectly  from the sale of equity 
for additional information regarding the credit facility  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
caltius senior subordinated notes in connection with our acquisition of isla  effective as of december   we entered into an investment agreement with caltius 
under the investment agreement  caltius provided the company with a million aggregate principal amount evidenced by the issuance of the senior subordinated notes  the net proceeds of which were primarily used to finance the cash payments due at closing of the isla transaction 
the senior subordinated notes accrue interest at the rate of per annum the accrual rate  and must be paid currently in cash on a quarterly basis at a rate of per annum the pay rate 
the outstanding principal balance of the senior subordinated notes will be increased by an amount the pik amount equal to the difference between interest accrued at the accrual rate and interest accrued at the pay rate unless the company makes an election to pay the pik amount in cash 
we have exercised our option to pay all pik in cash 
the senior subordinated notes are non amortizing  with all principal due upon maturity at december  under the caltius financing  we are subject to certain financial covenants  including funded leverage ratio covenants  senior funded leverage ratio covenants and fixed charges ratio covenants 
the first financial covenant limits our ratio of funded debt as defined therein to consolidated ebitda as adjusted and measured on a rolling four quarter basis to to  reducing to to at march  and to at march  the second financial covenant limits our ratio of senior debt defined as amounts borrowed from bofa and the senior subordinated notes to consolidated ebitda as adjusted and measured on a rolling four quarter basis to to  reducing to to on march  and to on march  the third financial covenant requires that we maintain a basic fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to under the investment agreement  we also issued  restricted shares our common stock to caltius 
for additional information regarding the caltius financing  see note to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report 
given our continued focus on the build out of our network of agency locations  we believe that our current working capital and anticipated cash flow from operations are adequate to fund existing operations for the next months 
however  continued growth through strategic acquisitions  will require additional sources of financing as our existing working capital is not sufficient to finance our operations and an acquisition program 
thus  our ability to finance future acquisitions will be limited by the availability of additional capital
