the higher profitability in fiscal compared with fiscal was achieved despite increased sg a expenses due to an increase in incentive compensation expense  reflecting stronger financial results in relation to pre established financial targets 
as noted above  we experienced a slight decline in net sales of our us produced upholstery fabrics with net sales totaling million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal however  we experienced significant profit improvement for this operation  with gross profit totaling million in fiscal compared with  in fiscal as a result of our efforts to improve productivity  we have a much more efficient operation with higher capacity utilization than a year ago 
in addition  raw material costs have stabilized compared to last year 
however  looking ahead we continue to face a challenging market in upholstery fabrics and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain this performance in the us operation in fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we established a wholly owned subsidiary located in poland  which is called culp europe 
during the last two fiscal years  we have continued our efforts to develop this operation 
however  the ongoing uncertainties related to the european economy have adversely affected this business 
while this is creating challenges for the near term  we remain optimistic about the future opportunities for culp europe to enhance our global sales as business conditions improve

other expense other expense was  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal this increase primarily reflects fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate for our subsidiaries domiciled in china 
we have been able to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange rate fluctuations associated with our subsidiaries domiciled in canada and poland through maintenance of a natural hedge by keeping in balance of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than the u 
s dollar 
although we will continue to try to maintain this natural hedge  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in future reporting periods 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach as prescribed by asc topic  income taxes 
this approach requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
using the enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which differences are expected to reverse  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and tax basis of an asset or liability 
if a change in the effective tax rate to be applied to a timing difference is determined to be appropriate  it will affect the provision for income taxes during the period that the determination is made

the income tax rate was reduced by for taxable income subject to lower statutory income rates in foreign jurisdictions compared with the statutory income tax rate of for the united states 
the income tax rate increased for an increase in unrecognized tax benefits

the income tax expense for fiscal is different from the amount obtained by applying our statutory rate of to income before income taxes for the following reasons the income tax rate was reduced by  or an income tax benefit of million was recorded  for the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
this income tax benefit of million represents a million income tax benefit pertaining to a change in judgment about the future realization of our us net deferred tax assets  offset by an income tax charge of  associated with the realization of our us loss carryforwards from fiscal pre tax income

deferred income taxes valuation allowance summary in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on our assessment at april   we recorded a partial valuation allowance of  of which  pertained to certain us state net operating loss carryforwards and credits and  pertained to loss carryforwards associated with our culp europe operation located in poland 
based on our assessment at april   we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
no valuation allowance was recorded against our net deferred tax assets associated with our operations located in china and canada at april  and april   respectively 
united states our net deferred tax asset regarding our us operations primarily pertains to incurring significant us pre tax losses over the last several years  with us loss carryforwards totaling million  million  and million at april   april  and may   respectively 
fiscal due to the favorable results of our multi year restructuring process in our upholstery fabric operations and key acquisitions and capital investments made for our mattress fabric segment  on a cumulative three year basis ending may   our us operations earned a pre tax income of million 
in addition  our us operations reported a pre tax income over fiscal years and totaling million 
we believed that fiscal years and were a more indicative measure of future pre tax income as these fiscal years reflected operating performance after the cost savings of the profit improvement and restructuring plans were realized and the full operational effects of the acquisitions associated with the company s mattress fabric operations located in the us although the financial results of our us operations had improved  the significant uncertainty in the overall economic climate made it very difficult to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations 
based on these economic conditions  we believed it was too uncertain to project pre tax income associated with our us operations after fiscal based on this significant positive and negative evidence  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that was expected to reverse beyond fiscal and we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for projected us taxable income in fiscal that was expected to reduce our us loss carryforwards 
fiscal our us operations earned a cumulative pretax income through the second quarter of fiscal and fiscal years and totaling million 
this increase in cumulative pre tax income was driven by our mattress fabrics operations which primarily resides in the us during the second quarter of fiscal  our mattress fabrics operations had net sales totaling million compared with million in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  our mattress fabrics operations had operating income totaling million in the second quarter of fiscal compared with million in the second quarter of fiscal these improved results in the second quarter of fiscal  which were better than expected  can be attributed to increased sales from our sales and marketing initiatives and new programs with customers who are leading suppliers in the bedding industry 
collectively these developments increased our confidence in forecasting us taxable income through fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal although our us operations financial results continued to improve through the second quarter of fiscal  the significant uncertainty in the overall economic climate also continued 
as a result  to forecast medium and long term financial results associated with our us operations was difficult 
since it would have taken a significant period of time for our us operations to realize their us net deferred income tax assets based on earned and forecasted us pre tax income levels  we believed it was too uncertain to project us pre tax income levels associated with our us operations after fiscal that support a more likely than not assertion as of end of our second quarter of fiscal these trends continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal and  as a result  we maintained our position that we could only forecast us taxable income through fiscal our mattress fabric operations had net sales that totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal in addition  our mattress fabric operations reported operating income of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal based on the positive and negative evidence noted above  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of million at april   against the net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations that were expected to reverse beyond fiscal accordingly  we recognized an income tax benefit of million in the second quarter of fiscal for the reduction in this valuation allowance for estimated us taxable income in fiscal years and that is expected reduce our us loss carryfowards 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we booked an income tax charge of  due to a change in our estimate of us taxable income in fiscal years and that was made in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal the improvement in our us operations financial results continued through the second quarter of fiscal our us operations earned a pre tax income on a cumulative three year basis as of april  the end of our fiscal of million and an additional million through the second quarter of fiscal this continued earnings improvement from our us operations was primarily due to the operating performance of our mattress fabric operations 
through the second quarter of fiscal  our mattress fabric operations had net sales that totaled million  an increase of compared with million through the second quarter of fiscal in addition  our mattress fabric operations reported operating income of million through the second quarter of fiscal  an increase of compared with million through the second quarter of fiscal these improved results through the second quarter of fiscal  which were better than expected  can be attributed to the recent evolution of the bedding industry into a more decorative business with growing consumer demand for better bedding and a higher quality mattress fabric  and the recent stabilization of raw material prices 
in accordance with asc topic  we assess whether the undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries will be reinvested indefinitely or eventually distributed to our us parent company 
asc topic requires that a deferred tax liability should be recorded for undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries that will not be reinvested indefinitely 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  it was management s intention to indefinitely reinvest all of our undistributed foreign earnings 
accordingly  no deferred tax liability had been recorded in connection with the future repatriation of these earnings 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we assessed the financial requirements of our us parent company and foreign subsidiaries and determined that our undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries totaling million will not be reinvested indefinitely and will be eventually distributed to our us parent company 
the financial requirements of the us parent company have recently changed due to a decision to return cash to its shareholders through dividend payments and common stock repurchases 
also  in order to keep up with the recent growth in consumer demand for better bedding and a higher quality mattress fabric  it is our intention to continue our investment in our domestic mattress fabric operations 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded a deferred tax liability and corresponding income tax charge of million during the second quarter of fiscal and an additional  in the last half of fiscal at april   we had accumulated earnings and profits from our foreign subsidiaries totaling million 
at the same date  the deferred tax liability associated with our undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries included us income and foreign withholding taxes totaling million  offset by us foreign income tax credits of million 
based on the positive evidence at the end of our second quarter of fiscal  as supported by our cumulative earnings history  current and expected earnings improvement driven by our us mattress fabric operations  and the significant source of us taxable income from the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  we recorded an income tax benefit of million to reverse substantially all of the valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an income tax charge of  due to a change in our second quarter estimate of the recoverability of our us state net loss operating carryforwards 
after this valuation allowance reversal of million  we have a remaining valuation allowance against our us net deferred tax assets totaling  as of april  this valuation allowance pertains to certain us state net operating loss carryforwards and credits in which it is more likely than not that these us state net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized prior to their respective expiration dates 
poland during the third quarter of fiscal  we established culp europe  a wholly owned subsidiary located in poland 
due to the initial start up costs of setting up this operation and the current state of the european economy  this operation had recorded cumulative pre tax losses through the second quarter of fiscal based on the negative evidence  as supported by our cumulative loss history and the short carryforward period of years imposed by the polish government  we recorded a full valuation allowance against culp europe s net deferred tax assets as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal as of april   we recorded an income tax charge and a full valuation allowance against culp europe s net deferred tax assets totaling  china our net deferred tax asset regarding our china operations primarily pertains to the book versus tax basis difference associated with our china operation s fixed assets 
this book versus tax basis difference resulted from our impairment losses and fixed asset write downs associated with our september upholstery fabrics restructuring plan 
in order for this net deferred tax asset to have been realized  our china operations must have had sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize its tax over book depreciation expense 
during fiscal  management assessed both positive and negative evidence and concluded that there was sufficient positive evidence that our net deferred tax assets regarding our china operations will more likely than not be realized 
due to the favorable results from our restructuring activities and profit improvement plan initiated in the second quarter of fiscal  our china operations became profitable  reporting pre tax income of million in fiscal and fiscal in addition  our china operations earned pre tax income of million over a cumulative three year period ending may  as a result of the improvement of our china operations pre tax income levels that have been demonstrated over a cumulative period of three years  there was sufficient positive evidence that our china operations can provide sufficient pre tax income levels to utilize its tax over book depreciation expense 
based on this significant positive evidence  we recognized an income tax benefit of million to reduce the valuation allowance of million recorded at may  the beginning of fiscal 
change in valuation allowance in fiscal  we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the reduction of our valuation allowance 
this million decrease represents a million income tax benefit pertaining to a change in judgment about the future realization of our us net deferred tax assets  offset by an income tax charge of  for the establishment of a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets associated with our culp europe operations located in poland

we have been able to respond to this increased demand as we benefited from investments in production facilities that expanded our internal capacity 
during fiscal  the bedding industry started to evolve into a more decorative business with increased product diversity and growing consumer demand for better bedding and a higher quality mattress fabric 
our expanded manufacturing platform allowed us to better serve our customers by providing them with a diverse product line in all major product categories 
this product diversity  along with our design capabilities  created additional sales opportunities with customers who are leading suppliers in the bedding industry 
as a result  we experienced sales gains across all major product categories in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase also reflected price increases we implemented starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially offset the increased raw material costs noted below

the final outcome of these tax uncertainties is dependent upon various matters including tax examinations  legal proceedings  competent authority proceedings  changes in regulatory tax laws  or interpretations of those tax laws  or expiration of statutes of limitation 
as a result of these inherent uncertainties  the company cannot reasonably estimate the timing of payment of these amounts 
of the million in total gross unrecognized tax benefits  million would not be subject to cash payments due to the company s us federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
capital expenditures capital expenditures on a cash basis were million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
these capital expenditures primarily pertain to our mattress fabrics segment 
depreciation expense was million and million for fiscal and  respectively  and primarily pertained to our mattress fabrics segment 
for fiscal  we are estimating capital expenditures and depreciation expense for the company as a whole to be million and million  respectively 
the estimated capital expenditures and depreciation expense primarily relate to the mattress fabrics segment 
these are management s current expectations only  and changes in our business needs could cause changes in plans for capital expenditures and expectations for related depreciation expense 
accounts payable capital expenditures at april   we had total amounts due regarding capital expenditures totaling  which pertain to outstanding vendor invoices  none of which are financed 
this amount due of  is required to be paid in full during fiscal inflation any significant increase in our raw material costs  utility energy costs and general economic inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company  because competitive conditions have limited our ability to pass significant operating increases on to customers 
as discussed elsewhere in this report see segment analysis  significant increases in raw material costs led to lower profit margins for both of our business segments during fiscal years and critical accounting policies us generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
some of these estimates require difficult  subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain  and as a result actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
due to the estimation processes involved  management considers the following summarized accounting policies and their application to be critical to understanding the company s business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts 
substantially all of our accounts receivable are due from residential and commercial furniture and bedding manufacturers 
ownership of these manufacturers is increasingly concentrated and certain bedding manufacturers have a high degree of leverage 
as of april   accounts receivable from furniture manufacturers totaled approximately million  and accounts receivable from bedding manufacturers totaled approximately million 
additionally  as of april   the aggregate accounts receivable balance of the company s ten largest customers was million  or of trade accounts receivable 
no customers within the upholstery fabrics segment accounted for or more of consolidated accounts receivable as of april  one customer within the mattress fabrics segment represented of consolidated accounts receivable at april  we continuously perform credit evaluations of our customers  considering numerous inputs including customers financial position  past payment history  cash flows and management capability  historical loss experience  and economic conditions and prospects 
once evaluated  each customer is assigned a credit grade 
credit grades are adjusted as warranted 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used in connection with establishing the reserve for allowance for doubtful accounts 
while management believes that adequate allowances for doubtful accounts have been provided in the consolidated financial statements  it is possible that we could experience additional unexpected credit losses 
the reserve balance for doubtful accounts was  and  at april  and april   respectively 
inventory valuation 
we operate as a make to order and make to stock business 
although management closely monitors demand in each product area to decide which patterns and styles to hold in inventory  the increasing availability of low cost imports and the gradual shifts in consumer preferences expose the company to markdowns of inventory 
management continually examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value 
experience has shown that the most significant indicator of the need for inventory markdowns is the age of the inventory and the planned discontinuance of certain patterns 
as a result  the company provides inventory valuation markdowns based upon set percentages for inventory aging categories  generally using six  nine  twelve and fifteen month categories 
we also provide inventory valuation write downs based on the planned discontinuance of certain products based on the current market values at that time as compared to their current carrying values 
while management believes that adequate markdowns for excess and obsolete inventory have been made in the consolidated financial statements  significant unanticipated changes in demand or changes in consumer tastes and preferences could result in additional excess and obsolete inventory in the future 
the reserve for inventory markdowns was million at april  and april   respectively 
goodwill 
management assesses goodwill for impairment at the end of each fiscal year or between annual tests if an event that occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying values 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we early adopted asu no 
 intangibles goodwill and other asc topic testing goodwill for impairment when we performed our annual impairment test 
asu no 
provides companies with a new option to determine whether or not it is necessary to apply the traditional two step quantitative goodwill impairment test in asc topic under asu no 
 companies are no longer required to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit mattress fabrics segment unless it determines  on the basis of qualitative information  that it is more likely than not ie greater than that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
based on our qualitative assessment  we determined that our goodwill is not impaired using a more likely than not standard 
the company s goodwill of million at april   relates to the mattress fabrics segment 
although we believe we have based the impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions  the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards at income tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income loss in the period that includes the enactment date 
in accordance with asc topic  we evaluate our deferred income taxes to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
asc topic requires that companies assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard with significant weight being given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
since the company operates in multiple jurisdictions  we assess the need for a valuation allowance on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  taking into account the effects of local tax law 
based on this assessment  we recorded a partial valuation allowance of  and million against our net deferred tax assets at april  and april   respectively 
our valuation allowance of  at april   represents a  valuation allowance against certain us state net operating loss carryforwards and credits and a valuation allowance of  against our loss carryforwards associated with our culp europe operation located in poland 
our valuation of million at april   was against our net deferred tax assets associated with our us operations 
refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for disclosures regarding our assessment of our recorded valuation allowance as of april  and april   respectively 
in accordance with asc topic  we must recognize the tax impact from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax impact recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution 
penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions are recorded as tax expense 
significant judgment is required in the identification of uncertain tax positions and in the estimation of penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions 
at april   we had million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits  of which million and million were classified as net non current deferred income taxes and income taxes payable long term  respectively  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements for fiscal recently issued accounting standards refer to note located in the notes to the consolidated statements for recently issued accounting pronouncements for fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our revolving credit lines 
at april   our us revolving credit agreement provides for a pricing matrix to determine the interest rate payable on loans made under this agreement 
our revolving credit line associated with our china subsidiaries bears interest at a rate determined by the chinese government 
at april   there were no borrowings outstanding under our us and china revolving credit lines 
at april   our revolving credit line associated with our operation in europe bears interest rate of wibor plus and had borrowings outstanding of  we are not exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
our unsecured term notes have a fixed interest rate of we are exposed to market risk from changes in the value of foreign currencies for our subsidiaries domiciled in china  canada  and poland 
we try to maintain a natural hedge by keeping a balance of our assets and liabilities denominated in the local currency of our subsidiaries domiciled in canada and poland  although there is no assurance that we will be able to continually maintain this natural hedge 
our foreign subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency 
a substantial portion of the company s imports purchased outside the us are denominated in us dollars 
a change in the above exchange rates at april   would not have had a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position
