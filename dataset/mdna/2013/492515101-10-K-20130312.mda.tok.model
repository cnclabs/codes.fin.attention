item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
employees as of february   we had full and part time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors 
you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition and or operating results could be materially harmed 
these factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the future and may never become profitable 
we have a limited operating history 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies 
in addition  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as we continue our research and development efforts  we will incur increasing losses 
we may continue to incur substantial operating losses even if we begin to generate revenues from our drug candidate 
we have not yet commercialized any drug candidate and cannot be sure that we will ever be able to do so 
in april we announced that our phase trial for krx perifosine for refractory advanced colorectal cancer did not meet the primary endpoint of improving overall survival versus capecitabine and placebo 
following these results  in may  we abandoned our development efforts and terminated our license relating to the krx perifosine drug candidate  and re focused our development efforts on our only remaining drug candidate  zerenex 
even if we commercialize zerenex  or a future drug candidate  we may not become profitable 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors  including our ability to complete our development efforts  obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidate  successfully complete any post approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize our drug candidate 
risks associated with our product development efforts if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trial programs  or if such clinical trials take longer to complete than we project  our ability to execute our current business strategy will be adversely affected 
whether or not and how quickly we complete clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate at which we are able to engage clinical trial sites and  thereafter  the rate of enrollment of patients  and the rate we collect  clean  lock and analyze the clinical trial database 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and whether existing or new drugs are approved for the indication we are studying 
we are aware that other companies are currently conducting or planning clinical trials that seek to enroll patients with the same disease that we are studying 
if we experience delays in identifying and contracting with sites and or in patient enrollment in our clinical trial programs  we may incur additional costs and delays in our development programs  and may not be able to complete our clinical trials in a cost effective or timely manner or at all 
in addition  conducting multi national studies adds another level of complexity and risk 
as a result  we may be subject to events affecting countries outside the us negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we conduct or unanticipated adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials 
for example  in may  we abandoned our development efforts and terminated our license for krx perifosine following negative results from the phase trial 
we may also opt to change the delivery method  formulation or dosage which could affect efficacy results for the drug candidate 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame  if at all 
we have conducted two phase clinical trials initiated in may and september for zerenex as a treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end stage renal disease pursuant to a spa agreement with the fda 
many companies which have been granted spas and or the right to utilize fast track or accelerated approvals have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their drugs 
since we are seeking approval for zerenex under a spa  based on protocol designs negotiated with  and agreed to by  the fda  we may be subject to enhanced scrutiny 
regardless of the success of our phase clinical trials  a spa does not guarantee approval 
the fda may raise issues of safety  study conduct  bias  deviation from the protocol  statistical power  patient completion rates  changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision 
the fda may also seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision 
additionally  the regulatory approval of new therapies could invalidate our spa agreement  or require us to conduct additional  expensive clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval 
in may  we announced positive scientific advice from the european medicines agency  or ema  for the development of zerenex for the management and control of serum phosphorus in esrd patients undergoing dialysis  and in pre dialysis chronic kidney disease  or ckd  patients 
the scientific advice from the ema indicates that our successful phase program in the us  in conjunction with safety data generated from other clinical studies with zerenex  will be considered sufficient to support a european marketing authorization application  or maa  to the ema for the indication in esrd patients on dialysis 
as a result  we believe that since our phase program in the us was successful  we will not need to conduct any additional clinical trials to assess the safety or efficacy of zerenex in order to obtain european approval in the dialysis setting 
the scientific advice also provided us with a regulatory path forward in the pre dialysis ckd setting in europe 
scientific advice is legally non binding and is based on the current scientific knowledge  which may be subject to future changes 
many companies which have been provided with scientific advice by the ema have ultimately failed to obtain approval of an maa for their drugs 
additionally  even if the primary endpoint in a phase clinical trial is achieved  the scientific advice does not guarantee approval 
the ema may raise issues of safety  study conduct  bias  deviation from the protocol  statistical power  patient completion rates  changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision  which may delay or prevent ema approval of zerenex 
additionally  we have never submitted an nda or similar application for approval in the us  europe  or in any country  which may result in a delay in  or the rejection of  our filing of an nda  maa or similar application 
during the drug development process  regulatory agencies will typically ask questions of drug sponsors 
while we endeavor to answer all such questions in a timely fashion  or in the nda or maa  some questions may remain unanswered by the time we submit our nda and maa  or may be difficult or impossible to answer to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities 
unless the fda  ema  or similar regulatory authority in other countries  opts not to pursue these questions  filing of an nda  maa or similar application may be delayed or rejected 
we also can provide no assurance that our japanese partner  jt and torii  will not encounter delays or rejections of their nda or similar application filings with the japanese regulatory authority 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
if our drug candidate does not receive the necessary regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidate  zerenex 
we have not received  and may never receive  regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any drug candidate 
we may need to conduct significant additional research and human testing before we can apply for product approval with the fda or with regulatory authorities of other countries 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically depends on the nature  complexity and novelty of the product 
it requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical tests can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda  or regulatory authority of another country as applicable  may pose additional questions or request further toxicological  pre clinical or clinical data or substantiation 
for example  while ferric citrate is a generally recognized as safe  or gras  substance in the us  and the fda has not requested us to conduct a two year carcinogenicity study in animals  there is no assurance that prior to  at the time of  or subsequent to the filing of an nda that the fda or some other regulatory authority will not ask us to conduct such a study 
consequently  it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidate and failure can occur at any stage of this process 
negative or inconclusive results or medical events during a pre clinical or clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts 
furthermore  interim results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict their final results  and acceptable results in early studies might not be obtained in later studies 
safety signals detected during clinical studies and pre clinical animal studies  such as the gastrointestinal bleeding and liver toxicities that have been seen in some high dose  ferric citrate canine studies  may require us to perform additional safety studies or analyses  which could delay the development of the drug or lead to a decision to discontinue development of the drug 
we have submitted to the fda data from our short term and long term rat and canine pre clinical studies for zerenex 
while the fda has reviewed the data from these studies and we have conducted our phase clinical program  we can provide no assurance that the fda will not raise any safety concerns in the future from these studies 
drug candidates in the later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired traits of safety and efficacy despite positive results in earlier clinical testing 
the risk remains that a pivotal program may generate efficacy data that will be insufficiently persuasive for the approval of the drug  or may raise safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
the risk also remains that a clinical program conducted by one of our partners may raise efficacy or safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
interpretation of the prior pre clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data of our drug candidate may be flawed 
there can be no assurance that safety and or efficacy concerns from the prior data were not overlooked or misinterpreted  which in subsequent  larger studies might appear and prevent approval of such drug candidate 
in addition  top line results reported on completed clinical trials are based on a preliminary analysis of then available data both safety and efficacy and there is the risk that such findings and conclusions could change following a more comprehensive review of the data by us or a regulatory authority 
for example  on january   we announced successful top line results from our long term phase study of zerenex for the treatment of elevated serum phosphorus levels  or hyperphosphatemia  in patients with esrd on dialysis 
in this study  zerenex met the study primary endpoint  demonstrating a highly statistically significant change in serum phosphorus versus placebo over the four week efficacy assessment period of the study 
in addition  zerenex met the key secondary endpoints of increasing ferritin and tsat and reducing the use of iv iron and esas versus the active control group over the week safety assessment period of the study 
we can provide no assurance that our findings and conclusions from our long term phase study of zerenex will not change following a more comprehensive review of the data by us or a regulatory authority 
clinical trials have a high risk of failure 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving what appeared to be promising results in earlier trials 
we experienced such a setback with our phase krx perifosine results in april  and we can provide no assurance that we will not experience such setbacks with zerenex or any other drug candidate we develop 
if we experience delays in the testing or approval process for our existing drug candidate or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than originally planned  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidate may be materially impaired 
in addition  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the us and abroad 
accordingly  we may encounter unforeseen problems and delays in the approval process 
although we engage  from time to time  clinical research organizations with experience in conducting regulatory trials  errors in the conduct  monitoring  data capture and analysis  and or auditing could potentially invalidate the results 
because all of our proprietary technologies are licensed or sublicensed to us by third parties  termination of these license rights would prevent us from developing and commercializing zerenex 
we do not own our drug candidate  zerenex 
we have licensed and sublicensed the rights  patent or otherwise  to zerenex from a third party  panion bf biotech  inc  or panion  who in turn licenses certain rights to zerenex from one of the inventors of zerenex 
the license agreement with panion requires us to meet development milestones and imposes development and commercialization due diligence requirements on us 
in addition  under the agreement  we must pay royalties on sales of product resulting from the licensed technologies and pay the patent filing  prosecution and maintenance costs related to the license 
if we do not meet our obligations in a timely manner or if we otherwise breach the terms of our license agreement  panion could terminate the agreement  and we would lose the rights to zerenex 
in addition  if panion breaches its agreement with the inventor from whom it licenses rights to zerenex  panion could lose its license  which could impair or delay our ability to develop and commercialize zerenex 
from time to time  we may have disagreements with our licensors or collaborators  or they and or we may have disagreements with the original inventors  regarding the terms of our agreements or ownership of proprietary rights  which could lead to delays in the research  development and commercialization of our current  and any future  drug candidate  could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive  or could lead to the termination of a license  or force us to negotiate a revised or new license agreement on terms less favorable than the original 
in addition  in the event that the owners and or licensors of the rights we license were to enter into bankruptcy or similar proceedings  we could potentially lose our rights to our drug candidates or our rights could otherwise be adversely affected  which could prevent us from developing or commercializing our drug candidates 
finally  our rights to develop and commercialize zerenex  whether ourselves or with third parties  are subject to and limited by the terms and conditions of our licenses to zerenex and the licenses and sublicenses we grant to others 
we rely on third parties to manufacture and analytically test our drug candidate 
if these third parties do not successfully manufacture and test our drug candidate  our business will be harmed 
we have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we intend to continue  in whole or in part  to use third parties to manufacture and analytically test our drug candidate for use in clinical trials and for future sales 
we may not be able to enter into future contract agreements with these third parties on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize our drug candidate will depend on the ability of such third parties to manufacture our drug candidate on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  and other regulatory requirements  including requirements from federal  state and local environmental and safety regulatory agencies and foreign regulatory requirements  if applicable 
prior to approval  we will need to complete validation studies that the fda must review and approve 
significant scale up of manufacturing may result in unanticipated technical challenges and may require additional validation studies that the fda must review and approve 
contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production  including problems involving raw material supplies  production yields  scaled up product characteristics  quality control and assurance  shortage of qualified personnel  capacity constraints  changing priorities within the contract manufacturers  compliance with fda and foreign regulations  environmental compliance  production costs and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
any of these difficulties  if they occur  and are not overcome to the satisfaction of the fda or other regulatory agency  could lead to significant delays and possibly the termination of the development program for our drug candidate 
these risks become more acute as we scale up for commercial quantities  where a reliable source of raw material supplies becomes critical to commercial success 
for example  given the large quantity of materials required for ferric citrate production  as we approach commercialization for zerenex we will need to ensure an adequate supply of starting materials that meet quality  quantity and cost standards 
failure to achieve this level of supply can jeopardize the successful commercialization of the product 
moreover  issues that may arise in our current transition to commercial batch sizes with our third party manufacturers of zerenex can lead to delays in our development timelines 
our third party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required by us to successfully produce and market our drug candidate 
in addition  our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding foreign governmental agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmp  as well as other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we periodically audit our contractors for adherence to regulatory requirements  we cannot assure you that unforeseen changes at these contractors will not occur that could change their regulatory standing 
the same issues apply to contract analytical services which we use for testing of our drug candidate 
we will not have control over  other than by contract and periodic oversight  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
we are currently developing analytical tools for ferric citrate drug substance and drug product testing 
failure to develop effective analytical tools could result in regulatory or technical delay or could jeopardize our ability to obtain fda approval 
moreover  even with effective analytical tooling available  there is no assurance that we will be able to analyze all the raw materials and qualify all impurities to the satisfaction of the fda  possibly requiring additional analytical studies  analytical method development  or preclinical studies  which could significantly delay our ability to file an nda or receive regulatory approval for our drug candidate 
additionally  changes in the analytical specifications required by the fda or other regulatory authority  such as united states pharmacopeial convention standards  from time to time  could delay our ability to file an nda or receive regulatory approval for our drug candidate 
switching or engaging multiple third party contractors to produce our drug substance or drug product may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers may be limited and the process by which multiple manufacturers make the drug substance or drug product must meet established specifications at each manufacturing facility 
it may be difficult for us to find and engage replacement or multiple manufacturers quickly and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
for zerenex  we currently rely on one supplier to source the ferric citrate drug substance 
the loss of this source of supply would result in significant additional costs and delays in our development program 
moreover  if we need to add or change manufacturers after commercialization  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve any new manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda and foreign regulations and standards 
if we do not establish or maintain manufacturing  drug development and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to commercialize our products 
we do not possess all of the capabilities to fully commercialize our product on our own 
from time to time  we may need to contract with third parties to manufacture our product candidate  assist us in developing  testing and obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing our compound and technologies  and market and distribute our drug product 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into agreements with such third parties on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully contract with third parties for these services when needed  or if existing arrangements for these services are terminated  whether or not through our actions  or if such third parties do not fully perform under these arrangements  we may have to delay  scale back or end one or more of our drug development programs or seek to develop or commercialize our product independently  which could result in delays 
furthermore  such failure could result in the termination of license rights to our product 
if these manufacturing  development or marketing agreements take the form of a partnership or strategic alliance  such arrangements may provide our collaborators with significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the development and commercialization of our product 
accordingly  to the extent that we rely on third parties to research  develop or commercialize our product  we are unable to control whether such product will be scientifically or commercially successful 
additionally  if these third parties fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform their work in a satisfactory manner  in spite of our efforts to monitor and ensure the quality of such work  we may face delays in achieving the regulatory milestones required for commercialization of our current  and any future  drug candidate 
if  in the future  the market conditions for raising capital deteriorate  we may be forced to rely predominantly or entirely on our ability to contract with third parties for our manufacturing  drug development and marketing 
if we are unable to contract with such third parties  we may be forced to limit or suspend or terminate the development of our drug candidate or marketing of any approved product 
our reliance on third parties  such as clinical research organizations  or cros  may result in delays in completing  or a failure to complete  clinical trials if such cros fail to perform under our agreements with them 
in the course of product development  we engage cros to conduct and manage clinical studies and to assist us in guiding our products through the fda review and approval process 
if the cros fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner  we may face significant delays in completing our clinical trials  as well as commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
furthermore  any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials and the market approval of drug candidate s 
other risks related to our business if we are unable to develop adequate sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform some of these functions  we will not be able to commercialize our product effectively 
in the event our drug candidate is approved by the fda  we may conduct our own sales and marketing effort to support the drug 
we currently have limited experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
to directly market and distribute any product  we must build and train a sales and marketing organization with appropriate technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may attempt to build and train such a sales and marketing organization on our own or with the assistance of a contract sales organization 
for some market opportunities  we may want or need to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms in order to increase the commercial success of our product 
we may not be able to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities of our own or enter into such arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our product  and some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  and these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  building marketing and distribution capabilities may be more expensive than we anticipate  requiring us to divert capital from other intended purposes or preventing us from building our marketing and distribution capabilities to the desired levels 
from time to time we may consider offers or hold discussions with companies for partnerships or the acquisition of our company or any of our current or future products 
any accepted offer may preclude us from commercializing our product s effectively 
even if we obtain regulatory approval to market zerenex  if it fails to achieve market acceptance  we may never record meaningful revenues 
even if zerenex is approved for sale  it may not be commercially successful in the marketplace 
market acceptance of our drug product will depend on a number of factors  including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  of the safety and efficacy of our product candidate  including  but not limited to  the perception of the long term effects of the potential absorption and or accumulation of ferric iron or citrate resulting from the use of zerenex  the marketing claims that the fda will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of zerenex  including potential marketing claims related to the effect of zerenex on iron storage parameters and on the need for  and use of  iv iron and esas  the rates of adoption of our product by medical practitioners and the target populations for our product  the potential advantages that our product offers over existing treatment methods  the cost effectiveness of our product relative to competing products  which may be exacerbated as existing treatments go off patent  the availability of government or third party payor reimbursement for our product  the side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our product or similar products  and the effectiveness of our sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
because we expect sales of our product  if approved  to generate substantially all of our revenues in the long term  the failure of our drug to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or other sources of revenue 
if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug product  or our drug product does not achieve market acceptance vis vis existing treatments  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and public and private research institutions 
in addition  companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us 
many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development  regulation  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel  attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations  and license technologies that are competitive with ours 
as a result  our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that could render our drug product obsolete or noncompetitive 
to compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors 
zerenex  if approved in the us  would have to compete with other fda approved phosphate binders such as renagel sevelamer hydrochloride and renvela sevelamer carbonate  both marketed by genzyme corporation a wholly owned subsidiary of sanofi aventis  phoslo calcium acetate  marketed by fresenius medical care  and fosrenol lanthanum carbonate  marketed by shire pharmaceuticals group plc  as well as over the counter calcium carbonate products such as tums and metal based options such as aluminum and magnesium 
our strategy to compete against these existing treatments depends in part on physicians and patients accepting that zerenex provides certain advantages  such as the absence of hypercalcemia as compared to phoslo  reduced pill burden as compared to renagel and the lack of lanthanum build up and a preferred route of administration non chewable as compared to fosrenol 
in addition  we compete against existing treatments on price  which becomes more challenging as generic versions of these existing treatments come to market 
for example  a generic formulation of phoslo manufactured by roxane laboratories  inc was launched in the us in october in addition  upon the expiration of their core patents  generic formulations of renagel and renvela expected in the us beginning in march  and generic formulations of fosrenol  may be launched  which could have a material effect on the pricing of phosphate binders 
in addition  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug product 
other companies have drug candidates in various stages of pre clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to acquire and develop drug products 
some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidate and may be commercialized earlier 
even if we are successful in developing effective drugs  our product s may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors 
fresenius medical care and vifor pharma are collaborating on the development of an iron based phosphate binder  pa  which we believe to be a chewable tablet formulation 
recently  fresenius medical care and vifor pharma announced positive data from a multi national  phase study of pa in dialysis patients  and also announced the submission to the ema of the first approval dossier for pa if approved by the fda and or ema  pa could have a material effect on the market opportunities of zerenex in the us and europe  respectively 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our operations could be disrupted and our business could be harmed 
as of february   we had full and part time employees 
to successfully develop our drug candidate  we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
our limited resources may hinder our efforts to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  if we lose the services of our current personnel  in particular  ron bentsur  our chief executive officer  our ability to continue to execute on our business plan could be materially impaired 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
bentsur  such agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us 
any acquisitions we make may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
as part of our business strategy  we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses  products  technologies  capabilities and personnel 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisitions involve a number of operational risks  including difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired business  our inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of the acquired business  our inability to maintain the acquired company s relationship with key third parties  such as alliance partners  exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition  the diversion of our management s attention from our core business  and the potential impairment of goodwill and write off of in process research and development costs  adversely affecting our reported results of operations 
the status of reimbursement from third party payors for newly approved health care drugs is uncertain and failure to obtain adequate reimbursement could limit our ability to generate revenue 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs  and other third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors  including medicare  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted labeling approval 
in  congress passed the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  which for the first time established prescription drug coverage for medicare beneficiaries  under medicare part d 
under this program  beneficiaries purchase insurance coverage from private insurance companies to cover the cost of their prescription drugs 
however  third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for our product  if approved 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our product  its market acceptance may be reduced 
health care reform measures could adversely affect our business 
the business prospects and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
in the us and in foreign jurisdictions there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system  such as proposals relating to the pricing of healthcare products and services in the us or internationally  the reimportation of drugs into the us from other countries where they are then sold at a lower price  and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors 
for example  drug manufacturers are required to have a national rebate agreement with the department of health and human services  or hhs  in order to obtain state medicaid coverage  which requires manufacturers to pay a rebate on drugs dispensed to medicaid patients 
on january   the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  issued a proposed regulation covering the calculation of average manufacturer price  or amp  which is the key variable in the calculation of these rebates 
furthermore  in the us  health care reform legislation titled the patient protection and affordable care act  or ppaca  was signed into law in march the impact of this legislation on our business is inherently difficult to predict as many of the details regarding the implementation of this legislation have not been determined 
in a decision issued on june   the united states supreme court upheld the majority of ppaca 
the court s decision allows implementation of key provisions impacting drug and device manufacturers to go forward 
this includes ppaca changes to the medicare part d program including closing the donut hole  medicaid drug rebate program including the definition of amp  and expansion of the b drug discount program 
the decision also allows the fda and cms to continue with implementation efforts  including related to the biologics price competition and innovation act and the physician payments sunshine act  both of which were enacted as part of the ppaca 
regulations to implement ppaca could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses 
government financed comparative efficacy research could also result in new practice guidelines  labeling or reimbursement policies that discourages use of our product 
for example  in july  cms released its final rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for end stage renal disease facilities as required by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act  or mippa 
the final rule delayed the inclusion of oral medications without intravenous equivalents  such as phosphate binders  in the bundle until january   however  on january   the united states congress passed legislation known as the american taxpayer relief act of  which  among other things  delays by two years the implementation of oral only end stage renal disease related drugs  including phosphate binders  in the bundled esrd prospective payment system  until january  if phosphate binders are included in the bundle beginning in  separate medicare reimbursement will no longer be available for phosphate binders  as it is today under medicare part d 
while it is too early to project the impact bundling may have on the phosphate binder industry  the impact could potentially cause dramatic price reductions for phosphate binders 
on september   the food and drug administration amendments act of was enacted  giving the fda enhanced post market authority  including the authority to require post marketing studies and clinical trials  labeling changes based on new safety information  and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the fda 
the fda s exercise of this authority may result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development  clinical trials and regulatory review and approval  which may also increase costs related to complying with new post approval regulatory requirements  and increase potential fda restrictions on the sale or distribution of approved products 
finally  on july   the food and drug administration safety and innovation act was enacted to  among other things  renew the drug user fee program  expand the fda s inspection records access and require manufacturers to establish appropriate oversight and controls over their suppliers and the supply chain  including raw material suppliers and contract manufacturers  as a part of cgmp compliance 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our drug candidate in clinical trials  and the future sale of any approved drug candidate and new technology  exposes us to liability claims 
although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims against us  if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to cease clinical trials of our drug candidate or limit commercialization of any approved product 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the commercial sale of any approved products if marketing approval is obtained  however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
we also may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover product liability risks that may arise 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  our inability to continue to develop a drug candidate  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  and loss of revenues 
consequently  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
in connection with the clinical trial management and site recruitment services we previously provided  we may be exposed to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
online collaborative oncology group  inc  or ocog  a subsidiary we acquired through our acquisition of access oncology  inc in  previously provided clinical trial management and site recruitment services to us as well as other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
ocog entered into its last third party service contract in and its business was discontinued as of december in conducting the activities of ocog  any failure on our part to comply with applicable governmental regulations or contractual obligations could expose us to liability to our clients and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we performed 
in addition  the wrongful or erroneous delivery of health care information or services may expose us to liability 
if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any such claims  the losses could be material 
our corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
the development  manufacturing  pricing  sale  marketing  and reimbursement of our product s  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and other authorities within the us and numerous entities outside of the us we are a relatively small company with full and part time employees as of february  we also have significantly fewer employees than many other companies that have a product candidate in clinical development  and we rely heavily on third parties to conduct many important functions 
while we believe that our corporate compliance program is sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable regulations  we cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  including suspension or termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  issuance of an enforcement or warning letter  restrictions on our product or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of product s from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
risks related to our financial condition our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities may not be adequate to finance our operating cash requirements for the length of time that we have estimated 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents at december   the january public offering  of which the net proceeds from this offering were approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses of approximately million  and the million milestone payment received from jt and torii in january are sufficient to fund our anticipated operating cash requirements for approximately the next to months 
the actual amount of cash that we will need to operate is subject to many factors  including  but not limited to  the timing and expenditures associated with the build up of pre launch launch inventory  the timing and expenditures associated with submitting the nda and maa for zerenex  the timing and expenditures associated with select pre commercial commercial activities related to zerenex  and the timing  design and conduct of clinical trials for zerenex 
we are dependent upon significant financing to provide the cash necessary to execute our current operations  including the commercialization of zerenex 
our forecast of the period of time through which our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will be adequate to support our current operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the timing and expenditures associated with the build up of pre launch launch inventory  the timing and expenditures associated with submitting the nda and maa filings for zerenex  the timing and expenditures associated with select pre commercial commercial activities related to zerenex  the timing  design and conduct of  and results from  clinical trials for zerenex  the timing of expenses associated with manufacturing and product development of zerenex and those proprietary drug candidates that may be in licensed  partnered or acquired  the timing of the in licensing  partnering and acquisition of new product opportunities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered  or may enter  into research and development agreements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangement  the timing and expenses associated with capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capabilities  the timing and expenses associated with building our own commercial infrastructure to manufacture  market and sell our drug candidate and those that may be in licensed  partnered or acquired  and the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
the costs related to litigation 
if our cash is insufficient to meet future operating requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  we may be required to cease or reduce our operating activities or sell or license to third parties some or all of our intellectual property 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted 
if we need to raise additional funds through the sale or license of our intellectual property  we may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us  if at all 
risks related to our intellectual property and third party contracts if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  third parties may be able to use our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability  and the ability of our licensors  to obtain and maintain patent protection on our drug product and technologies  and to successfully defend these patents against third party challenges 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date 
accordingly  the patents we use may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative drug products or technologies or design around our patented drug product and technologies which may have an adverse effect on our business 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the us that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in front of the us patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products  any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization  thus reducing any advantage of the patent 
the patents we use may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
as many of the patents we use are licensed or sublicensed from third parties  we may not be able to enforce such licensed patents against third party infringers without the cooperation of the patent owner and the licensor  which may not be forthcoming 
in addition  we may not be successful or timely in obtaining any patents for which we submit applications 
additionally  the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the us in addition  in jurisdictions outside the us where we have patent rights  we may be unable to prevent unlicensed parties from selling or importing products or technologies derived elsewhere using our proprietary technology 
we also rely on trade secrets and know how to protect our intellectual property where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we require our employees  licensees  collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  this may not be sufficient to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  we share ownership and publication rights to data relating to our drug product and technologies with our research collaborators and scientific advisors 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of this information  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information will be at risk 
the intellectual property that we own or have licensed relating to our drug candidate  zerenex  is limited  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect the value of zerenex 
the patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to zerenex are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market zerenex 
in particular the first composition of matter and method patent relating to zerenex in the united states us patent no 
 expires in february we cannot assure you that we can obtain any extension of the term of this patent for delays caused by fda regulatory review the maximum amount of term of extension available under the patent term extension provisions of usc would extend the term of this patent to february 
composition of matter patents can provide protection for pharmaceutical products to the extent that the specifically covered compositions are key  non interchangeable components of the pharmaceutical product 
upon expiration of us patent no 
 competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same composition as our product  so long as the competitors do not infringe any other patents that we may hold  such as other composition of matter patents and or method of use patents 
our methods of use patents only protect the product when used or sold for the claimed methods 
however  these types of patents do not limit a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product that is labeled for an indication that is outside of our patented methods  or for which there is a substantial use in commerce outside of our patented methods 
our pending patent applications may not issue as patents and may not issue in all countries in which we develop  manufacture or potentially sell our product s or in countries where others develop  manufacture and potentially sell products using our technologies 
moreover  our pending patent applications  if issued as patents  may not provide additional protection for our product 
because any potential date for regulatory approval is currently unknown  it is possible that the life of these patents following regulatory approval will be minimal  even if the above discussed patent term extension is obtained 
obtaining proof of direct infringement by a competitor for a method of use patent can be difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product may not engage in the patented use 
additionally  obtaining proof that a competitor contributes to  or induces  infringement of a patented method by another can be difficult because an off label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement 
in addition  proving inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor 
if we are required to defend ourselves against claims or to protect our own proprietary rights against others  it could result in substantial costs to us and the distraction of our management 
an adverse ruling in any litigation or administrative proceeding could prevent us from marketing and selling zerenex if we obtain regulatory approval  increase the risk that a generic version of zerenex could enter the market to compete with zerenex  limit our development and commercialization of zerenex  or otherwise harm our competitive position and result in additional significant costs 
in addition  any successful claim of infringement asserted against us could subject us to monetary damages or injunction  which could prevent us from making or selling zerenex 
we also may be required to obtain licenses to use the relevant technology 
such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  physicians may prescribe a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved  or off label indications  that are covered by the applicable patents 
although such off label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents  such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute 
in addition  any limitations of our patent protection described above may adversely affect the value of our product candidate and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition to patent protection  we may utilize orphan drug regulations  pediatric exclusivity or other provisions of the food  drug and cosmetic act of  as amended  or fdca  such as new chemical entity exclusivity or new formulation exclusivity  to provide market exclusivity for a drug candidate 
orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases  currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than  individuals in the us  or  diseases that affect more than  individuals in the us but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for such fda approved orphan product 
in the us  the fda has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations 
if granted  this pediatric exclusivity provides an additional six months which are added to the term of data protection as well as to the term of a relevant patent  to the extent these protections have not already expired 
we may also seek to utilize market exclusivities in other territories  such as in the eu 
we cannot assure that our drug candidate  zerenex ferric citrate  or any drug candidates we may acquire or in license  will obtain such orphan drug designation  pediatric exclusivity  new chemical entity exclusivity or any other market exclusivity in the us  eu or any other territory  or that we will be the first to receive the respective regulatory approval for such drugs so as to be eligible for any market exclusivity protection 
litigation or third party claims could require us to spend substantial time and money defending such claims and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our product 
we may be forced to initiate litigation to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  or we may be sued by third parties asserting claims based on contract  tort or intellectual property infringement 
in addition  third parties may have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that zerenex or any other technologies infringe their patents 
if we are required to defend against suits brought by third parties  or if we sue third parties to protect our rights  we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs  and our management s attention may be diverted from operating our business 
in addition  any legal action against our licensor or us that seeks damages or an injunction of our commercial activities relating to zerenex or other technologies could subject us to monetary liability  a temporary or permanent injunction preventing the development  marketing and sale of zerenex or such technologies  and or require our licensor or us to obtain a license to continue to use zerenex or other technologies 
we cannot predict whether our licensor or we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
risks related to our common stock future sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future 
future issuances of common stock could further depress the market for our common stock 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes stock or other securities  our stockholders holdings may be significantly diluted 
in addition  stockholders holdings may also be diluted if we enter into arrangements with third parties permitting us to issue shares of common stock in lieu of certain cash payments upon the achievement of milestones 
our stock price can be volatile  which increases the risk of litigation  and may result in a significant decline in the value of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include developments concerning our drug candidate  including the safety and efficacy results from clinical trials and regulatory filings and approvals  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introductions or announcements of new products by us or our competitors  announcements of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments involving us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly or annual operating results  expectations regarding our financial condition  expiration or termination of licenses  research contracts or other collaboration agreements  including the recent termination of the license for krx perifosine  conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  negative comments and sentiment in the media  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  equity markets in general  and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets 
these broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our development and operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management s attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
certain anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
this could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  or control us 
these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock without the approval of our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of such holders 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
any of these provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control
