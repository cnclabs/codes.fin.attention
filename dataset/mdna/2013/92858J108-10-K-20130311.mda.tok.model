sources of revenues we derive our revenues from subscription agreements and related services and from news distribution services 
our subscription agreements contain multiple service elements and deliverables  which generally include use of our cloud based software  news distribution services  hosting services  content and content updates and customer support and may also include implementation and training services 
the typical term of our subscription agreements is one year  however  our customers may purchase subscriptions with monthly or multi year terms 
we separately invoice our customers in advance of their subscription  with payment terms that generally require our customers to pay us within days of invoice 
our subscription agreements typically are non cancelable  though customers have the right to terminate their agreements for cause if we materially breach our obligations under the agreement 
our subscription agreements may include amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers  and any such unbilled amounts are not recorded in deferred revenue until invoiced 
additionally  we derive revenue on a per transaction basis from our news distribution services 
we generally receive payment in advance of the online distribution of the news release 
professional services revenue consists primarily of data migration  custom development and training 
our professional service engagements are billed on a fixed fee basis with payment terms requiring our customers to pay us generally within days of invoice 
cost of revenues and operating expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues has consisted primarily of compensation for training  editorial and support personnel  hosting infrastructure  press release distribution  acquisition  maintenance and amortization of the information database  amortization of purchased technology from business combinations  amortization of capitalized software development costs  depreciation associated with computer equipment and software and allocated overhead 
we allocate overhead expenses such as employee benefits  computer and office supplies  management information systems and depreciation for computer equipment based on headcount 
as a result  indirect overhead expenses are included in cost of revenues and each operating expense category 
we believe content is an integral part of our solution and provides our customers with access to broad  current and relevant information critical to their marketing efforts 
we expect to continue to make investments in both our own content as well as content acquired from third parties and to continue to enhance our proprietary information database and enhance our news monitoring and social media monitoring services 
we expect in  cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat or decrease slightly as a percentage of revenues 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses are our largest operating expense 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation for our sales and marketing personnel  sales commissions and incentives  marketing programs  including lead generation  promotional events  webinars and other brand building expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense our sales commissions at the time a subscription agreement is executed by the customer  and we recognize substantially all of our revenues ratably over the term of the corresponding subscription agreement 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
we plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing to add new customers and increase sales to our existing customers 
such investments will include adding sales personnel and expanding our marketing activities to continue to build brand awareness and generate additional sales leads 
we expect in  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat as a percentage of revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation for our software application development personnel and allocated overhead 
we have historically focused our research and development efforts on increasing the functionality and enhancing the ease of use of our cloud based software 
because of our hosted solutions  we are able to provide our customers with a single  shared version of our most recent application  which enables us to have relatively low expenses as compared to traditional enterprise software business models 
we expect that in  research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of compensation and related expenses for executive  finance  legal  human resources and administrative personnel  as well as fees for legal  accounting and other consulting services  including acquisition related expenses  third party payment processing and credit card fees  facilities rent  other corporate expenses  fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and allocated overhead 
we expect that in  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars but will remain flat as a percentage of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortized intangible assets consist of customer relationships and trade names acquired in business combinations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and include the accounts of vocus  inc and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  software development costs  useful lives of property  equipment and software  intangible assets and goodwill  contingent liabilities  self insurance  revenue recognition  fair value of stock based awards and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note  summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the collection of the fee is probable and the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
we allocate consideration to each deliverable in our multiple element arrangements based on the relative selling prices and recognize revenue as the respective services are delivered or performed 
our separate units of accounting consist of subscription services  news distribution services and professional services 
our subscription agreements generally include the use of our cloud based software  hosting services  content and content updates and customer support 
our subscription agreements do not provide customers the right to take possession of the software at any time 
we also distribute individual news releases to the internet which are indexed by major search engines and distributed directly to various news sites  journalists and other key constituents 
we recognize revenue on a per transaction basis when the press releases are made available to the public 
our professional services consist primarily of data migration  custom development and training 
our cloud based software does not require significant modification and customization services 
we established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price for certain of our news distribution services as the selling price for a substantial majority of stand alone sales falls within a narrow range around the median selling price 
we determined third party evidence tpe of selling price is not available for any of our services due to differences in the features and functionality compared to competitor s products 
therefore  we use the estimated selling prices esp for the remaining deliverables by analyzing multiple factors such as historical pricing trends  discounting practices  gross margin objectives and other market conditions 
sales and other taxes collected from customers to be remitted to government authorities are excluded from revenues 
prior to january   all elements in our multiple element subscription agreements were considered a single unit of accounting  and accordingly  we recognized all associated fees over the subscription period  which is typically one year 
we determined that we did not have objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements in our arrangements and  as a result  subscription revenues were recognized ratably over the term of the subscription 
professional services sold separately from a subscription arrangement were recognized as the services were performed 
the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements to provide updates on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated and how the consideration should be allocated  eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method  and require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using esp of each deliverable if it does not have vsoe or tpe of selling price 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the new accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after january  that contain subscription services sold with news distribution services or professional services on a prospective basis and determined the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
sales commissions 
sales commissions are expensed when a subscription agreement is executed by the customer 
as a result  we incur sales expense before the recognition of the related revenues 
stock based compensation 
we recognize compensation expense for equity awards based on the fair value of the award and on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on the estimated portion of the award that is expected to vest 
we apply estimated forfeiture rates based on analyses of historical data  including termination patterns and other factors 
we use the quoted closing market price of our common stock on the grant date to measure the fair value of our restricted stock awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of our option awards 
we use the daily historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the options to calculate the expected volatility 
the expected term of option awards is determined using a combination of historical exercise data with expected future exercise patterns using the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term for outstanding awards 
the risk free interest rate is based on the rate on us treasury securities with maturities consistent with the estimated expected term of the awards 
we have not paid dividends and do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  use an expected dividend yield of zero 
business combinations 
we have completed acquisitions of businesses that have resulted in the recording of goodwill and identifiable definite lived intangible assets 
definite lived intangible assets consist of acquired customer relationships  trade names and purchased technology 
definite lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to seven years 
we recognize all of the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and contingent consideration at their fair values on the acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
accounting for these acquisitions requires us to make determinations about the fair value of assets acquired  useful lives for definite lived tangible and intangible assets  and liabilities assumed that involve estimates and judgments 
goodwill and long lived assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually 
we perform our annual impairment assessment on november  or whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we operate under one reporting unit  and as a result  evaluate goodwill impairment based on our fair value as a whole 
in assessing goodwill for impairment  an entity has the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if  after assessing the totality of events or circumstances  it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value  then performing the two step impairment test is unnecessary 
an entity can choose not to perform a qualitative assessment for any of its reporting units  and proceed directly to the use of the two step impairment test 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use an income approach based on discounted cash flows to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
our cash flow assumptions consider historical and forecasted revenue  operating costs and other relevant factors which are consistent with the plans used to manage our operations 
based on the results of our most recent annual assessment performed on november   we concluded that the fair value of its reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
no events or circumstances occurred from the date of the assessment through december  that would impact this conclusion 
we assess impairment of definite lived intangible and other long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may no longer be fully recoverable 
we determine the impairment  if any  by comparing the carrying value of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets 
an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
there were no impairment charges for long lived assets for the year ended december  impairment charges for long lived assets for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for deductible temporary differences between the respective reported amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  as well as for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
net deferred tax assets are reduced by the valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in the fourth quarter of  based on recent operating results and our current projections of future losses  we established a full valuation allowance on our us federal and state net deferred tax assets as we concluded that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
we have historically maintained a full valuation allowance on net deferred tax assets of certain of our foreign subsidiaries because we determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize the benefits of our foreign deferred tax assets 
our estimates related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits 
if we determine it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits  we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts  circumstances and information available 
we are also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to our unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months 
we file income tax returns in us federal jurisdictions and various state and foreign jurisdictions and are subject to us federal  state  and foreign tax examinations for years ranging from to results of operations the following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated as a percentage of total revenues

based on our business plan  we expect that cash held overseas will continue to be used for our international operations and therefore do not anticipate repatriating these funds

we have various non cancelable operating leases  primarily related to office real estate  that expire through and generally contain renewal options for up to five years 
we have an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of our landlord for our headquarters in maryland in the amount of  the letter of credit does not require a compensating balance and is active through may in accordance with the terms of the lease agreement  we are permitted to reduce the letter of credit by approximately  annually for each of the first five years commencing may as of december   the outstanding balance was  and no amounts had been drawn against it 
we also established two letters of credit in favor of our principal landlord in the united kingdom 
the irrevocable letters of credit are  in the aggregate  do not require a compensating balance and are active through as of december   the outstanding balances were  in the aggregate  and no amounts have been drawn against them 
in march  we established an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of our landlord for our icontact office in north carolina in the amount of  which will automatically reduce to  on march  the letter of credit does not require a compensating balance and is active through march  but may be renewed through june  on february   we established a million revolving credit facility revolver with a major lending institution which will be available for use until february  in february  the revolver was amended to extend the availability for use until april  the revolver is intended to be used for general working capital purposes and to provide increased liquidity and financial flexibility 
the revolver has a one year term  renewable annually and bears interest equal to the bba libor daily floating rate plus 
in addition  we pay a monthly fee equal to on any unused funds under the revolving credit facility 
as collateral for extension of credit under the facility  we granted security interests in favor of the institution of substantially all of our assets and pledged the stock of our directly owned domestic subsidiaries and of the shares of our foreign subsidiaries 
as of december   the revolver was reduced by our outstanding letters of credit of million 
as such  we had million available to borrow under the revolver 
as of december   million remains available for purchases under our stock repurchase program 
although we repurchased stock during the years ended december  and  we may or may not do so in future periods  and our revolving credit facility limits our ability to engage in stock repurchases 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which will begin to expire in through our foreign subsidiaries generated nol carryforwards of million which will begin to expire in and may be indefinite lived 
included in these amounts at december  are approximately million in cumulative income tax deductions on the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards 
this income tax benefit will be recorded to additional paid in capital when realized 
as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
other than our operating leases for office space and computer equipment  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
we intend to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditures primarily through cash flows from operations 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and investments together with our expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures  contractual obligations  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements in the future may also be financed through our revolving credit facility or additional equity financing 
there can be no assurance that financing would come at favorable terms  if at all 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  that requires us to make future cash payments payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations contingent consideration obligation long term debt under notes payable obligations capital lease obligations total obligations the amount included in the table above represents the fair value of the liability for contingent consideration as of december   which is included in accrued expenses and is expected to be paid in the first quarter of in addition  our other liabilities include  related to uncertain tax positions as of december  due to uncertainties in the timing of the completion of tax audits  the timing of the resolution of these positions is uncertain  and we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond twelve months 
as a result  this amount is not included in the above table 
in connection with our acquisition of icontact  on february   we will be required to redeem each issued and outstanding share of series a convertible preferred stock for per share from our legally available funds  or such lesser amounts as we may then redeem under delaware corporate law 
each share of series a convertible preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at any time at the option of the holder 
for conversions occurring on or before february   each share of series a convertible preferred stock may be converted into shares of common stock subject to customary adjustments  and subject to increase if we fail to fulfill our obligation to redeem the preferred stock on february  
on or after february   each share of series a convertible preferred stock which has not been redeemed may be converted into shares of common stock subject to customary adjustments 
any redemption value is not included in above table due to the uncertainty of conversion or redemption 
the contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum services to be used  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly changes in the british pound sterling  euro and philippine peso 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in the exchange rates of currencies against the us dollar 
for the years ended december   and  revenues denominated in a foreign currency were approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
exchange rate fluctuations have not significantly impacted our results of operations and cash flows 
our future results of operations and cash flows may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have not utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge our foreign exchange exposure  however  we may choose to use such contracts in the future 
interest rate sensitivity our cash consists of interest and non interest bearing accounts 
our cash equivalents and investments consist primarily of money market funds and certificates of deposit 
our interest income is subject to interest rate risk 
for the year ended december   a fluctuation in interest rates of percentage point would not materially change interest income 
our interest bearing long term borrowings as of december  were not material 
in the event that we borrow under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest equal to the bba libor daily floating rate plus  we would be exposed to interest rate fluctuations
