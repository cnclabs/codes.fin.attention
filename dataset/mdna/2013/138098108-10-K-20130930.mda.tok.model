water purification and filtration water purification equipment and services  filtration and separation products  and disinfectants for the medical  pharmaceutical  biotech  beverage and commercial industrial markets 
in addition  our therapeutic filtration business and chemistries business  formerly included in our all other reporting segment  have been integrated with our water purification and filtration segment for both operating and reporting purposes 
therapeutic filtration includes hollow fiber membrane filtration and separation technologies for medical applications 
chemistries include certain sterilants  disinfectants and decontamination services used in various applications for infection prevention and control 
healthcare disposables single use  infection prevention and control products used principally in the dental market including face masks  sterilization pouches  towels and bibs  tray covers  saliva ejectors  germicidal wipes  plastic cups and disinfectants 
this segment also manufactures and provides biological and chemical indicators for sterility assurance monitoring services in the acute care  alternate care and dental markets 
dialysis medical device reprocessing systems  sterilants disinfectants  dialysate concentrates and other supplies for renal dialysis 
specialty packaging specialty packaging and thermal control products  as well as related compliance training  for the transport of infectious and biological specimens and thermally sensitive pharmaceutical  medical and other products 
the specialty packaging operating segment is reported in the other reporting segment 
most of our equipment  consumables and supplies are used to help prevent or control the occurrence or spread of infections 
significant activity i in fiscal compared to fiscal  net sales and net income increased by and  respectively 
we continue to benefit from having a broad portfolio of infection prevention and control products sold into diverse business segments  where approximately of our net sales are attributable to consumable products and service 
the primary factors that contributed to this financial performance  as further described elsewhere in this md a  were as follows improved sales and profitability in our water purification and filtration segment primarily relating to i higher sales of our capital equipment  consumables and service in the dialysis industry mainly attributable to the increased overall demand driven by the growing number of dialysis patients and clinics in the united states and our new product introductions such as our heat sanitized water purification systems  which are sold at higher average selling prices than the systems with the traditional non heated sanitization technology  ii the market shortage of certain therapeutic filters as a result of damage done from an earthquake to the manufacturing facilities of a large competitor and iii increased demand for our sterilants from other manufacturers in the united states  higher sales and profitability in our healthcare disposables segment  primarily due to the november  acquisition of sps medical supply corp  increased demand for our face masks and sterility assurance products and improved gross profit percentage  improved sales and profitability in our endoscopy segment in fiscal principally due to i a shift of product mix to higher margin products including increases in sales volume of endoscope reprocessing disinfectant and consumable products as a result of the increased field population of equipment  as well as disposable infection control products used in gastrointestinal gi endoscopy procedures as a result of new product introductions  ii the inclusion in our first quarter of fiscal of  in one time acquisition related charges for the byrne acquisition and iii lower commission expense  the implementation of various cost control initiatives such as the closing of our japan location in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner  lower interest expense notwithstanding additional borrowings for the acquisitions of sps medical supply corp 
and siemens industry  inc s and siemens canada limited s collectively  siemens hemodialysis water business  and the impairment of an investment during the second quarter of fiscal  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
the above factors were partially offset by decreases in sales volume of our endoscope reprocessing equipment as these capital equipment sales were elevated in prior periods partially as a result of our participation in a major initiative by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscope reprocessing equipment as well as regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  the recording within cost of sales of  in fiscal in medical device excise tax as part of the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of  which became effective january  incurring approximately  in one time acquisition related charges for acquisitions completed in fiscal  an unfavorable net change of  in general and administrative expenses relating to favorable fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and a price floor financial instrument that were more favorable in the prior year compared with the current year  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  and decreases in net sales in our dialysis operating segment  although we have been able to minimize the adverse impact to the segment s profitability in fiscal compared with fiscal ii we sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers 
sales in our dialysis segment were adversely impacted by the decrease in demand for our renatron reprocessing equipment  sterilants and dialysate concentrate products  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
this reduction in dialysis sales has reduced overall profitability in this segment as compared with profitability in fiscal years prior to our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
a material decrease in the market for reprocessing products is likely to result in a significant loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability in this segment in the future

iii in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
the legislation imposes a significant new tax on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on certain us medical device sales beginning in january since a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation  our gross profit percentage is being adversely affected beginning in january  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
iv on march   our mar cor subsidiary entered into an agreement to acquire from siemens certain net assets of siemens hemodialysis water business the siemens water business or the siemens water acquisition  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
v on december   our mar cor subsidiary acquired certain net assets of eagle pure water systems  inc the eagle pure water business or the eagle pure water acquisition  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
vi on november   our crosstex subsidiary acquired all the issued and outstanding stock of sps medical supply corp 
the sps business or sps medical  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
vii the company issued  additional shares of common stock in connection with a three for two stock split effective in the form of a stock dividend paid on july  to stockholders of record on july  this stock split was in addition to the three for two stock split effective in the form of a stock dividend paid on february   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
viii on october   our board of directors approved an increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share per share on a pre split basis of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of december  and july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
ix in order to more fully capitalize on the strength of the medivators brand name currently used in our endoscopy business  we decided to change the name of minntech corporation to medivators inc medivators 
the name change was effective on august  x on august   the start of fiscal  our medivators subsidiary acquired the business and substantially all of the assets of byrne medical  inc bmi  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
certain components of the acquisition s purchase price were recorded at fair value and are continually re measured at each balance sheet date  which has created earnings volatility as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
xi in conjunction with the acquisition of the business and substantially all of the assets of bmi and the impending expiration of our existing credit facility  we entered into a  second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of august   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into interest rate swap agreements in fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
xii in fiscal  we acquired the gambro business on october  and the confirm monitoring business on february   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the results of operations described below reflect the operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
since the acquisitions of the sps business and the eagle pure water business were consummated on november  and december   respectively  their results of operations are included in the portion of fiscal subsequent to their acquisition dates  and are not included in our results of operations for fiscals and the sps business is included in the healthcare disposables segment and the eagle pure water business is included in the water purification and filtration segment 
on march   mar cor entered into an agreement to acquire the siemens water business by gradually transitioning customer service agreements to mar cor  which the majority of such contracts were transitioned as of july   the deemed acquisition date 
consequently  the results of operations of the siemens water business had an insignificant impact on our results of operations in fiscal and are not included in our results of operations in fiscals and the siemens water business is included in our water purification and filtration segment 
since the acquisition of the byrne medical business was completed on august   its results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscals and and are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal the byrne medical business is included in the endoscopy segment 
since the acquisitions of the gambro business and confirm monitoring business were completed on october  and february   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscals  and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates 
the gambro business is included in the water purification and filtration segment and the confirm monitoring business is included in the healthcare disposables segment 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed our internal reporting processes by combining our therapeutic filtration and chemistries operating segments  previously reported in the other reporting segment  with our water purification and filtration reporting segment to reflect the way the company  through its executive management  manages  allocates resources and measures the performance of its businesses 
all periods presented have been restated to reflect these changes 
the following table gives information as to the net sales and the percentage to the total net sales for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands endoscopy water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of water purification and filtration products and services  healthcare disposables products and endoscopy products and services 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i an increase in demand for our water purification capital equipment  consumables and service in the dialysis industry mainly as a result of the growing number of dialysis patients and clinics in the united states and our new product introductions such as our heat sanitized water purification systems  which are sold at higher average selling prices than systems with the traditional non heated sanitization technology  ii elevated demand  both in the united states and internationally  for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery as a result of a market shortage of these filters due to damage done from an earthquake to the manufacturing facilities of a large competitor  which were subsequently repaired  iii increased demand for our sterilants from other manufacturers in the united states and iv to a lesser extent  price increases on certain water purification products and services  which were implemented to partially offset increased costs 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to i the inclusion of  in net sales from the acquired sps business on november   ii increases in customer demand in the united states for our face masks and sterility assurance products and iii to a lesser extent  price increases on certain healthcare disposables products  which were implemented to partially offset increased costs 
these items were partially offset by the loss of some private label business as a result of a customer s decision to purchase certain healthcare disposable products from low cost providers including competitors whose products are manufactured in countries that have lower overall operating costs 
net sales of endoscopy products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increases in demand in the united states for i our disinfectants  service and consumables due to the increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment and ii our new product introductions of valves  kits and hybrid tubing procedural products disposable infection control products used in gastrointestinal gi endoscopy procedures 
these increases were partially offset by i a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment as demand had been elevated in the prior year period and ii overall lower selling prices of approximately  principally related to procedural products partly as a result of our strategic growth plan  which includes securing new sales to group purchasing organizations gpos which typically receive discounted selling prices as a result of their purchasing volume 
demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment had been elevated during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal due to our previous investments in new product offerings and sales and marketing programs  as well as regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  all of which enabled us to increase our sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment including successfully participating in a major initiative beginning in the second half of fiscal by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscope reprocessing equipment 
beginning in our second quarter of fiscal  this elevated level of capital equipment sales gradually decreased to a similar level that existed prior to the second half of fiscal however  we expect disinfectants  service  consumables and equipment accessories  which are sold at higher margins  to continue to benefit as we increase the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment 
net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal due to decreases in demand in both the united states and internationally including a decrease from our largest dialysis customer  davita  inc davita for our renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  sterilants and dialysate concentrate product a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment 
our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
the shift from reusable to single use dialyzers is principally due to the lowering cost of single use dialyzers  the ease of using a dialyzer one time  and the commitment of fresenius medical care  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states and a manufacturer of single use dialyzers  to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single use facilities 
in addition  davita has been evaluating the economics and other factors associated with single use versus reuse on a regional basis 
this evaluation has resulted in the conversion by davita of certain clinics from reuse to single use and in many cases the opening of new clinics as single use clinics 
a material decrease in the market for reprocessing products is likely to result in a significant loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future as well as potential future impairments of long lived assets 
additionally  our dialysis segment is highly dependent upon davita as a customer and any further shift by this customer away from reuse would have a material adverse effect on our dialysis segment net sales 
gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
the higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to i a more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain products that carry higher gross margin percentages than each segment s prior year overall gross profit percentages such as our face masks and sterility assurance products including sales of products relating to the newly acquired sps business in our healthcare disposables segment  disinfectants and procedural products in our endoscopy segment and filters and sterilants in our water purification and filtration segment as well as decreases in sales volume of lower margin products such as endoscope reprocessing equipment in our endoscopy segment  as discussed above and ii the inclusion in fiscal of a  one time acquisition accounting charge relating to the acquired inventory in the byrne acquisition 
these items were partially offset by i the inclusion of  for a new excise tax on qualified us medical device sales beginning january  ii lower selling prices of certain products primarily in our endoscopy segment partly as a result of our strategic growth plan  which includes securing new sales to group purchasing organizations gpos which typically receive discounted selling prices as a result of their purchasing volume  iii  in severance related charges as part of our cost reduction initiatives and iv a  one time acquisition accounting charge relating to the acquired inventory in the november  acquisition of the sps business 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
the legislation imposes a significant new tax on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january since a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation  we began recording the excise tax in cost of sales in january thereby adversely affecting our gross profit percentage 
although we have implemented cost reductions and revenue enhancement initiatives to partially offset this new excise tax  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in further reducing the impact of this tax on our business 
additionally  other elements of this legislation could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business in the future 
see risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future i by uncertainties associated with our product mix  ii by further price competition in certain of our segments such as healthcare disposables due to a more competitive environment as well as competition from products manufactured in lower cost locations  as explained below  endoscopy primarily due to our growth strategy as explained above and dialysis relating to the market shift from reusable to single use dialyzers as explained above or iii if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement further price increases 
some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in lower cost locations such as china  southeast asia and certain locations within north america due to lower overall costs despite expensive shipping costs  quality concerns  sustainability issues and other matters 
although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products  which are generally produced in the united states  are superior  we may experience significant pricing pressure that would adversely affect our gross profit in the future in our healthcare disposables segment as a result of lower cost competition from products produced in other geographic locations 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of selling expenses relating to the november  acquisition of the sps business and increased investments to further develop and support our sales team such as hiring additional sales personnel primarily in our water purification and filtration and endoscopy segments  funding increased travel budgets and providing annual raises  partially offset by approximately  in lower commissions primarily due to a change in the structure of our endoscopy sales commission plan as well as less sales of higher commission products 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscals and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i the inclusion of general and administrative expenses of the acquired sps business on november   ii higher personnel costs primarily relating to additional personnel  annual salary raises  employee benefit costs  recruiting and compensation costs associated with the hiring of our new chief operating officer  iii an unfavorable net change of  relating to favorable fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and a price floor financial instrument that were more favorable in the prior year compared with the current year  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  iv the inclusion of  of acquisition related expenses relating to fiscal acquisitions and v higher bad debt expense 
these increases were partially offset by the prior year inclusion of  in acquisition related expenses relating to the byrne acquisition and the prior year recording of  in additional stock based compensation related to an employment termination which required us to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were consistent in fiscal compared with fiscal operating income by segment the following table gives information as to the amount of operating income  as well as operating income as a percentage of net sales  for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands operating of operating of income net sales income net sales endoscopy water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis other operating income general corporate expenses income before interest  other income and income taxes the endoscopy segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i increases in demand in the united states for our disinfectants  service  consumables and disposable procedural products  which are primarily higher margin products  ii the inclusion in our first quarter of fiscal of a  one time acquisition accounting charge relating to the acquired inventory in the byrne acquisition  iii the prior year inclusion of  in acquisition related expenses relating to the byrne acquisition  iv lower commission expense and v lower warranty expense per unit relating to our endoscope reprocessing equipment 
these items were partially offset by i a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment  ii lower selling prices of certain endoscopy products  iii the recording of new medical device excise taxes beginning in january  iv an unfavorable net change of  in general and administrative expenses relating to favorable fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and a price floor financial instrument that were more favorable in the prior year compared with the current year  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  v additional investments in our sales team  and vi severance related charges as part of our cost reduction initiatives 
the water purification and filtration segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to due to i an increase in demand for our water purification capital equipment  consumables and service in the dialysis industry  as well as hemoconcentrator products and sterilants  as explained above  and ii the implementation of various cost control initiatives such as changes in the management structure and the closing of our japan location in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner 
partially offsetting these increases were i an increase in selling expenses due to the expansion of our sales team  ii annual salary increases  iii the inclusion of an excise tax on qualified us medical device sales beginning january  iv approximately  of acquisition costs related to the siemens acquisition and v an increase in warranty expense per unit relating to certain water purification capital equipment 
if we had not restructured our segment reporting in fiscal by combining two segments recorded in other to the water purification and filtration segment  the other reporting segment in fiscals and would have had operating income of  and an operating loss of  respectively  and the operating income of the water purification and filtration segment would have been  and  respectively 
the healthcare disposables segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to improved gross profit percentage  as explained above  and the acquisition of the sps business on november   partially offset by the inclusion of an excise tax on qualified us medical device sales beginning january despite a decrease in net sales  the dialysis segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to decreases in sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense as a result of various cost control initiatives such as the allocation of certain internal resources to other segments as well as the closing of our japan location in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner 
general corporate expenses relate to certain unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel and being a publicly traded company 
the increase in such costs in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the addition of internal and external resources  including the hiring of a chief operating officer in november  to address various growth initiatives and new compliance requirements 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average outstanding borrowings 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agreed to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders  as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other expense in our second quarter of fiscal  a  loss was recorded in other expense relating to the impairment of our investment in a company that developed a patented and proprietary antimicrobial agent  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
as further described below  the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate was principally due to recording a tax benefit in fiscal relating to the closing of our japan location  partially offset by the fiscal unfavorable impact of recording a loss relating to the impairment of an investment as compared with the following fiscal items i the favorable impact of the finalization of tax examinations in march and ii federal tax legislation enacted in january that enabled us to claim the research and experimentation tax credit for calendar  partially offset by a lower level of deductions in the current year compared to the prior year as a percentage of pre tax income 
in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the lower overall effective tax rate in fiscal was principally caused by i federal tax legislation that had expired in december  but was re enacted retroactively in january  that enabled us to claim the research and experimentation tax credit for calendar  ii the simultaneous finalization in march of an irs examination in the united states and a dutch tax authority examination in the netherlands that resulted in a favorable tax adjustment in the united states and iii not recording a tax benefit in the prior year on a loss relating to the impairment of an investment as a result of the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future 
partially offsetting these factors was a lower overall level of tax credits and deductions as a percentage of pre tax income as the underlying basis for the various credits and deductions increased significantly less than the increase in pre tax income 
in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our operations in canada  singapore and the netherlands 
collectively  these operations had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
all three of these locations have lower statutory income tax rates compared to the united states 
the low effective tax rate in fiscal was the result of the recording of a tax benefit in our third quarter of fiscal due to removing a valuation allowance on our net operating loss carryforwards nols in the netherlands since we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize the remaining nols in the near future as we now have certainty of the amount of remaining nols and the likely future pre tax income in the netherlands due to the simultaneous finalization in march of an irs examination in the united states and a dutch tax authority examination in the netherlands 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was favorably affected by the recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties and not recording tax expense on the fiscal profits from operations at our netherlands subsidiary due to the existence of nols 
in fiscal  approximately of our income before income taxes was generated from our subsidiary in japan  which we closed in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner 
the closing of our japan location had an insignificant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal because the losses from the write down of this investment recorded in our united states financial statements were offset by related gains recorded in our japan subsidiary financial statements excluding approximately  in severance and other closing costs 
these gains  which are not indicative of normal operating activities  were the primary reason why our japan subsidiary generated approximately of our income before income taxes in fiscal however  as a portion of these gains were not taxable in japan and due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards in japan  we did not record income tax expense on the gains 
conversely  we recorded an income tax benefit in the united states on the investment losses as we are able to claim a worthless stock tax deduction on our united states tax return 
consequently  our consolidated income tax expense was reduced by approximately  in our fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately 
excluding the favorable tax impact of this event  our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal would have been we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our overall effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  activity during fiscal unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax decrease in earnings per common share due to stock based compensation basic diluted the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and a reduction to income tax expense 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are expected to be deductible for tax purposes  except for certain options and restricted shares granted to employees residing outside of the united states  and were tax effected using the company s estimated us effective tax rate at the time of grant 
in january  in connection with an employment termination  we were required to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares resulting in an additional  of stock based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications of existing awards  accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option grant is determined on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
if the market price of our common stock increases or factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  the compensation expense that we would record for future stock options and stock awards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense before income taxes related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its united states income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as a reduction of previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and as a reduction of income taxes payable in the year of the deduction 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense which was determined based upon the award s fair value at the time the award is granted 
the differences noted above between actual tax deductions and the previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets are recorded as additional paid in capital 
in fiscals and  such income tax deductions reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively  and increased additional paid in capital by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscopy products and services  water purification and filtration products and services and healthcare disposables products  partially offset by a decrease in sales of dialysis products 
net sales of endoscopy products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i net sales in fiscal of  due to the acquisition of the byrne medical business on august  and ii increases in demand in the united states for our disinfectants  service  consumables and equipment accessories due to the significant increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment in fiscal demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment had been elevated during the second half of fiscal and the three months ended october  due to our previous investments in new product offerings and sales and marketing programs as well as regulatory issues experienced by a major competitor  all of which enabled us to increase our sales of endoscope reprocessing equipment including successfully participating in a major initiative beginning in the second half of fiscal by the veterans administration to upgrade their hospitals endoscope reprocessing equipment 
beginning in our second quarter of fiscal  this elevated level of capital equipment sales gradually decreased to a similar level that existed prior to the second half of fiscal however  we expect disinfectants  service  consumables and equipment accessories to continue to benefit from the increased installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment 
changes in selling prices did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales of water purification and filtration products and services increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i increases in demand for our water purification capital equipment and service in the dialysis industry including the impact of the prior year acquisition of the gambro business on october   ii incremental net sales attributable to new product introductions such as heat sanitized water purification systems and iii higher selling prices of our water purification products and services  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in demand for capital equipment used for commercial and industrial applications 
net sales of healthcare disposables products increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to i incremental net sales of approximately  in fiscal attributable to the prior year acquisition of the confirm monitoring business on february   ii higher selling prices  which favorably impacted net sales in fiscal by approximately  and iii an increase in customer demand for our face masks 
net sales of dialysis products and services decreased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the expected adverse impact of losing some dialysate concentrate business a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment from domestic customers as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this lower margin commodity product and ii a decrease in demand primarily in the united states including a decrease from our largest dialysis customer  davita  inc davita for our renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  sterilants and reprocessing supplies 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a continued decrease in net sales of our lower margin dialysate concentrate product in the future as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
furthermore  our market for dialysis reprocessing products is limited to dialysis centers that reuse dialyzers  which market has been decreasing in the united states despite the environmental advantages and our belief that the per procedure cost of reuse dialyzers is more economical than single use dialyzers 
the shift from reusable to single use dialyzers is principally due to the lowering cost of single use dialyzers  the ease of using a dialyzer one time  and the commitment of fresenius medical care  the largest dialysis provider chain in the united states and a manufacturer of single use dialyzers  to convert dialysis clinics performing reuse to single use facilities 
in addition  davita has been evaluating the economics and other factors associated with single use versus reuse on a market by market basis 
this evaluation has resulted in the conversion by davita of certain clinics from reuse to single use and in many cases the opening of new clinics as single use clinics 
a further decrease in the market for dialysis concentrate and reprocessing products is likely to result in continued loss of net sales and a lower level of profitability and operating cash flow in this segment in the future 
additionally  our dialysis segment is highly dependent upon davita as a customer and any further shift by this customer away from reuse would have a material adverse effect on our dialysis segment net sales 
changes in selling prices of our dialysis products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal increased compared with fiscal primarily due to i the acquisition of the byrne medical business  which products carry a higher gross profit percentage  ii more favorable sales mix due to increases in sales volume of certain higher margin products such as sterilants in our endoscopy segment and face masks in our healthcare disposables segment and decreases in sales volume of lower margin products such as endoscope reprocessing equipment in our endoscopy segment  iii improved gross margins in our water purification and filtration segment as a result of the full integration of the gambro business into our minnesota manufacturing facility  iv increases in selling prices in our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments  and v a decrease in raw materials costs primarily in our healthcare disposables segment due to the decreasing price of oil 
in march  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of was signed into law 
the legislation imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of a excise tax on all us medical device sales beginning in january since a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation  we will record the excise tax in cost of sales thereby adversely affecting our gross profit percentage beginning in january if this legislation had been effective throughout fiscal  we estimate that our annual excise tax would have been within the range of  to  which would have directly decreased our gross profit by such amount 
although we plan to implement further cost reductions and revenue enhancement initiatives to partially offset this new excise tax  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in significantly reducing the impact of this tax on our business 
additionally  other elements of this legislation could meaningfully change the way health care is developed and delivered and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business in the future 
see risk factors elsewhere in this form k 
furthermore  we cannot provide assurances that our gross profit percentage will not be adversely affected in the future i by uncertainties associated with our product mix  ii by price competition in certain of our segments such as healthcare disposables  endoscopy and dialysis or iii if raw materials and distribution costs increase and we are unable to implement price increases 
additionally  despite expensive shipping costs  some of our competitors manufacture certain healthcare disposable products in china and southeast asia due to lower overall costs 
although we believe the quality of our healthcare disposable products  which are generally produced in the united states  are superior to similar products produced in china and southeast asia  we may experience significant pricing pressure that would adversely affect our gross profit in the future in our healthcare disposables segment as a result of low cost competition from products produced in china and southeast asia 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i the inclusion of  of selling expenses relating to the byrne medical business in fiscal  ii approximately  in compensation expense exclusive of the acquired byrne medical business relating to annual salary raises  additional sales personnel primarily in our endoscopy segment  employee benefit costs and severance expense primarily in our water purification and filtration segment and iii higher marketing costs of approximately  primarily in our water purification and filtration  healthcare disposables and endoscopy segments  partially offset by approximately  in lower commission expense due to changing the structure of our endoscopy sales commission plan  which had previously included additional commissions for achieving certain year to date sales targets 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were and in fiscals and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to i the inclusion of  of general and administrative expenses relating to the byrne medical business  which includes approximately  in amortization of intangible assets   in acquisition related expenses and a  reduction in expenses relating to fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and a price floor financial instrument as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements and ii approximately  in compensation expense exclusive of the acquired byrne medical business relating to annual salary raises  higher incentive compensation  additional administrative personnel  employee benefit costs and stock based compensation expense  including  in additional stock based compensation related to an employment termination which required us to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to development work on certain new products in our endoscopy segment  including new projects and continuing engineering costs related to the byrne acquisition 
operating income by segment the following table gives information as to the amount of operating income  as well as operating income as a percentage of net sales  for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands operating of operating of income net sales income net sales endoscopy water purification and filtration healthcare disposables dialysis other operating income general corporate expenses income before interest  other income and income taxes the endoscopy segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the acquisition of the byrne medical business on august  which generated sales of  at a higher gross margin percentage than our pre acquisition endoscopy segment but also had higher operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our pre acquisition endoscopy segment such operating expenses were partially offset by favorable fair value adjustments of  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  ii increases in demand in the united states for our disinfectants  service and consumables  which are higher margin products  due to the significant increase in the installed base of endoscope reprocessing equipment and iii lower commission expense  partially offset by a decrease in demand for our endoscope reprocessing equipment and higher research and development expense  as further explained above 
the water purification and filtration segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to increased net sales and improved gross profit as a percentage of net sales  as further explained above  partially offset by reduced profitability of therapeutic filtration and chemistry products due to i a reduction in sales demand for certain higher margin products including filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system who had phased out the use of our filter for their product  ii an increase in research and development expenses  iii the inclusion of costs associated with the closing of our japan location in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner  iv the recording of severance expense related to changes in the segment s management structure and v an increase in marketing expenses 
the healthcare disposables segment s operating income increased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to i the prior year acquisition of the confirm monitoring business on february  which generated incremental net sales of approximately  in fiscal at a higher gross margin percentage  ii higher selling prices and iii an increase in customer demand for our face masks  partially offset by an increase in marketing expenses  as further explained above 
the dialysis segment s operating income decreased by  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in net sales of higher margin products  such as our sterilants and renatron dialyzer reprocessing equipment  and our lower margin dialysate concentrate product  as further explained above 
general corporate expenses relate to certain unallocated corporate costs primarily related to executive management personnel and being a publicly traded company 
the increase in such costs in fiscal compared with fiscal is primarily due to the addition of internal and external resources  higher compensation expense including incentive compensation and an increase in corporate initiatives 
interest interest expense increased by  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal  primarily due to increases in average outstanding borrowings and average interest rates relating to the august  acquisition of the byrne medical business  as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders  as further described elsewhere in this md a and in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal other expense in our second quarter of fiscal  a  loss was recorded in other expense relating to the impairment of our investment in senior subordinated convertible promissory notes issued by biosafe  inc biosafe  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and in fiscals and  respectively 
the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate was principally due to the expiration of federal tax legislation relating to the research and experimentation tax credit  the unfavorable impact of recording a loss relating to the impairment of an investment  the ability to use foreign tax credits in the prior year relating to foreign repatriations and the geographic mix of pre tax income  partially offset by recording a tax benefit in fiscal relating to the closing of our japan location  as described below 
in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate of and  respectively 
the higher overall effective tax rate in fiscal was principally caused by i the december  expiration of federal tax legislation relating to the research and experimentation tax credit which as a result prevented us from claiming a larger tax credit in fiscal as compared with fiscal  ii not recognizing a tax benefit on the loss relating to the impairment of our biosafe investment  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  due to the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future and iii the recording of a tax credit in the prior year relating to the repatriation of  from one of our canadian subsidiaries in fiscal in fiscals and  approximately and  respectively  of our income before income taxes was generated from our subsidiary in japan  which we closed in july as part of our decision to service our japan customers in a more cost effective manner 
the closing of our japan location had an insignificant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes in fiscal because the losses from the write down of this investment recorded in our united states financial statements were offset by related gains recorded in our japan subsidiary financial statements excluding approximately  in severance and other closing costs 
these gains  which are not indicative of normal operating activities  were the primary reason why our japan subsidiary generated approximately of our income before income taxes 
however  as a portion of these gains were not taxable in japan and due to the existence of net operating loss carryforwards in japan  we did not record income tax expense on the gains 
conversely  we recorded an income tax benefit in the united states on the investment losses as we are able to claim a worthless stock tax deduction on our united states tax return 
consequently  our consolidated income tax expense was reduced by approximately  in our fourth quarter of fiscal  which increased both basic and diluted earnings per share by approximately 
excluding the favorable tax impact of this event  our consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal would have been 
in fiscals and  approximately and of our income before income taxes was generated from our operations in canada  singapore and the netherlands 
collectively  these operations had an overall effective tax rate of and in fiscals and  respectively 
all three of these locations have lower statutory income tax rates compared to the united states 
the higher overall effective tax rates in fiscal was due to the recognition of tax benefits upon resolution of income tax uncertainties  as more fully described below  which tax benefits were larger in the prior year in relation to income before income taxes for these foreign operations 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the tax authorities 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
however  if our unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our overall effective tax rate due to the size of the unrecognized tax benefits in relation to our income before income taxes 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on july  increase for current period tax position lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  the company is currently being audited by the internal revenue service for fiscal year our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax decrease in earnings per common share due to stock based compensation basic diluted the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense and an increase to additional paid in capital 
the related income tax benefits were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and a reduction to income tax expense 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are expected to be deductible for tax purposes  except for certain options and restricted shares granted to employees residing outside of the united states  and were tax effected using the company s estimated us effective tax rate at the time of grant 
in january  in connection with an employment termination  we were required to accelerate the vesting of certain stock options and restricted shares resulting in an additional  of stock based compensation expense recorded in general and administrative expenses 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications of existing awards  accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
if the market price of our common stock increases or factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of accounting standards codification asc topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  the compensation expense that we would record for future stock awards may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
all of our stock options and stock awards are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis over the vesting period  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense before income taxes related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised or restricted stock becomes vested  the company is allowed a deduction on its united states income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as a reduction of previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense which was determined based upon the award s fair value at the time the award is granted 
the differences noted above between actual tax deductions and the previously recorded long term deferred income tax assets are recorded as additional paid in capital 
in fiscals and  such income tax deductions reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively  and increased additional paid in capital by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at july   our working capital was  compared with  at july  this increase was primarily due to the significant growth in operating income  as more fully explained elsewhere in this md a  the increase in inventories  as explained below  and the november  acquisition of the sps business  which contributed total working capital of  on the date of the acquisition 
cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred taxes and a decrease in income taxes receivable due to the timing associated with tax payments  partially offset by an increase in inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation and a decrease in accounts receivable due to strong collections of receivables in the endoscopy segment  partially offset by an increase in inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration segments 
in fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation and deferred taxes and increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities due primarily to the timing associated with vendor payments and income taxes payable due to timing of payments  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable primarily due to strong sales of endoscopy products and services and water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables products and inventories due to planned strategic increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our healthcare disposables and endoscopy segments 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisitions of the sps business and siemens water business as well as capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the acquisition of the byrne medical business and to a lesser extent  capital expenditures 
in fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was primarily for the gambro acquisition and the confirm acquisition as well as capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings under our revolving credit facility relating to the acquisitions of the sps business and siemens water business  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to borrowings under our credit facilities relating to the acquisition of the byrne medical business  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was due primarily to borrowings under our revolving credit facility relating to the gambro acquisition and confirm acquisition  partially offset by repayments under our credit facilities 
stock dividends on july   the company issued  additional shares of common stock in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on july  to stockholders of record on july  on february   the company issued  additional shares of common stock in connection with a three for two stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend paid on february  to stockholders of record on january  cash dividends on october   our board of directors approved an increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share adjusted for the stock splits of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each december  and july  and totaled  in fiscal  we announced a increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share adjusted for the stock splits of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of january  and july  and totaled  in fiscal  we announced a increase in the semiannual cash dividend to per share adjusted for the stock splits of outstanding common stock  which was paid on each of january  and july  and totaled  future declaration of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of the company s board of directors 
long term contractual obligations as of july   aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases acquisitions payable compensation agreements deferred compensation and other total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facility reflect interest rates of and  which was our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at july  and reflects the impact of our interest rate swap agreements 
us credit agreement in conjunction with the byrne acquisition and the impending expiration of our existing revolving credit facility existing revolver facility  we entered into a  second amended and restated credit agreement dated as of august  the us credit agreement with our existing consortium of senior lenders to fund the cash consideration paid and the costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to refinance our existing revolver facility 
the us credit agreement includes i a five year  senior secured revolving credit facility with sublimits of up to  for letters of credit and up to  for swing line loans the revolving credit facility and ii a  senior secured term loan facility the term loan facility 
the us credit agreement expires on august  amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be reborrowed 
subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  the company may from time to time increase the revolving credit facility by an aggregate amount not to exceed  without the consent of the lenders 
the senior lenders include bank of america the lead bank and administrative agent  pnc bank  national association  and wells fargo bank  national association 
debt issuance costs relating to the us credit agreement were recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
such unamortized debt issuance costs amounted to  at july  borrowings under the us credit agreement bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon the company s consolidated leverage ratio  which is defined as the consolidated ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit agreement consolidated ebitda 
at august   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings were above the lender s base rate or above libor 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at august  the us credit agreement also provides for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated leverage ratio  such rate was at august  in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders 
with respect to our term loan facility  the interest rate swap is for the period that began august  and ends july   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  the interest rate swap is for the period that began august  and ends january   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing semi annually by increments of  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
the principal amounts of the term loan facility are to be paid in twenty consecutive quarterly installments of  beginning on september  the us credit agreement permits us to make optional prepayments of loans at any time without premium or penalty other than customary libor breakage fees 
we are required to make mandatory prepayments of amounts outstanding under the us credit agreement of i of the net proceeds received from certain sales or other dispositions of all or any part of the company and its subsidiaries assets  ii of certain insurance and condemnation proceeds received by the company or any of its subsidiaries  iii subject to certain exceptions  of the net cash proceeds received by the company or any of its subsidiaries from the issuance or occurrence of any indebtedness of the company or any of its subsidiaries  and iv subject to certain exceptions  of the net proceeds of the sale of certain equity 
the us credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants reasonably customary for similar credit facilities and is secured by i substantially all assets of cantel and its united states based subsidiaries including medivators  mar cor  crosstex  sps medical and strong dental products  inc and ii a pledge by cantel of all of the outstanding shares of medivators  mar cor  crosstex  sps medical and strong dental owned by cantel and of the outstanding shares of cantel s foreign based subsidiaries 
we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit agreement 
on july   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit agreement  which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively  and  was available to be borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
subsequent to july   we repaid  under the term loan facility and  under our revolving credit facility resulting in total outstanding borrowings of  at september  operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscals and  respectively 
acquisitions payable in connection with the byrne acquisition  we agreed that if the aggregate value of the  of cantel common stock issued as part of the consideration used to acquire the byrne medical business is less than  on july   we will pay to bmi in cash or stock at our option an amount equal to the difference between  and the then value of the shares based on the closing price of cantel common stock on the nyse on july   subject to certain conditions and limitations 
accordingly  at july   we have estimated  as the fair value of this payable  as more fully described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
compensation agreements we have previously entered into various severance contracts with executives of the company  including our corporate executive officers and our subsidiary chief executive officers  which define certain compensation arrangements relating to various employment termination scenarios 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of the byrne medical business on august   the sps business on november  and the eagle pure water business on december   we entered into three year employment agreements with certain executive officers of the acquired businesses 
deferred compensation and other deferred compensation and other includes deferred compensation arrangements for certain former medivators directors and officers and is recorded in other long term liabilities 
additionally  deferred compensation and other includes an insurance related claim and minimal commitments under noncancelable capital leases 
convertible note receivable in february  we invested an initial  in a senior subordinated convertible promissory note issued by biosafe in connection with biosafe s grant to us of certain exclusive and non exclusive license rights to biosafe s antimicrobial additive 
biosafe is the owner of a patented and proprietary antimicrobial agent that is built into the manufacturing of end products to achieve long lasting microbial protection on such end products surface 
as a result of biosafe s successful raising of a minimum incremental amount of cash following our investment  we invested an additional  in notes of biosafe in january bringing the aggregate investment in biosafe notes to  as obligated under our agreement with biosafe 
we are not obligated to invest any additional funds 
at january   we evaluated this investment for potential impairment and determined that repayment of the notes and accrued interest was unlikely primarily due to biosafe s inability to obtain additional financing and our assessment of biosafe s going concern 
accordingly  we deemed the investment  together with accrued interest of  fully impaired and recorded a loss of  during our second quarter of fiscal  which was recorded as other expense and a reduction in other assets in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  due to the inability to currently deduct a capital loss and the uncertainty of utilizing a capital loss tax benefit in the future  a tax benefit was not recognized on the loss relating to the impairment of this investment 
financing needs all of our operating segments generate significant cash from operations 
at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
such foreign cash is needed by our foreign subsidiaries for working capital purposes and current international growth initiatives 
accordingly  our foreign unremitted earnings are now considered permanently reinvested and unavailable for repatriation 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and the funds available under our us credit agreement will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations  particularly given that we historically have not needed to borrow for working capital purposes 
at august    was available under our us credit agreement 
in addition  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent  the company may from time to time increase the us credit agreement by an aggregate amount not to exceed  without the consent of the lenders 
foreign currency the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
additionally  changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
furthermore  certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our canadian and united states subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or canadian dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
changes in the value of the euro  singapore dollar and british pound against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in euros  singapore dollars or british pounds but must be converted into their functional currency 
furthermore  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the euro relative to the united states dollar  ii the singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros  singapore dollars and british pounds forward  which contracts are one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at august   which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expire on september  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy euros  singapore dollars and british pounds forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
in fiscal  such forward contracts substantially offset the impact on operations related to certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
we do not currently hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar because the currency impact on our canadian or united states subsidiaries assets closely offset the currency impact on our canadian or united states subsidiaries liabilities effectively minimizing realized gains and losses 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact upon our net income in fiscals and for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the total of the foreign currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of  in fiscal  but was increased to an overall gain of  due to a tax adjustment relating to our foreign unremitted earnings being permanently reinvested in foreign operations and initiatives  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
inflation although overall inflation did not have a significant effect on our business  an increase in commodity prices can adversely affect our gross margins 
specifically  our businesses can be adversely impacted by rising fuel and oil prices and are heavily reliant on certain raw materials  such as chemicals  paper  resin  stainless steel and plastic components 
from time to time  we experience price increases for raw materials 
if we are unable to implement price increases to our customers  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to endoscopy  dialysis and specialty packaging products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered  or post delivery obligations such as installation have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
a portion of our endoscopy  water purification and filtration and dialysis sales are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment and installation components based upon vendor specific objective evidence  which includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components 
if vendor specific objective evidence of selling price is not available  we allocate revenue to the elements of the bundled arrangement using the estimated selling price method in order to qualify the components as separate units of accounting 
revenue on the equipment component is recognized as the equipment is shipped to customers and title passes 
revenue on the installation component is recognized when the installation is complete 
a portion of our healthcare disposables sales relating to the mail in spore test kit is recorded as deferred revenue when initially sold 
we recognize the revenue on these test kits using an estimate based on historical experience of the amount of time that elapses from the point of sale to when the kit is returned to us and we communicate to the customer the results of the required laboratory test 
the related cost of the kits is recorded in inventory and recognized in cost of sales as the revenue is earned 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions  except a small portion of our sterility assurance products in our healthcare disposables segment 
with respect to the sterility assurance products  in addition to a restocking fee and payment of freight by the customer  such returns must be undamaged  returned within days and meet certain other criteria before products are accepted for return 
as historical returns of these products have been rare  we record a nominal allowance for such product returns 
for all other products  customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a small portion of our sales of dialysis  healthcare disposable and water purification and filtration products and certain prepaid specialty packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  healthcare disposables  water purification and filtration and endoscopy customers  rebates are provided  such rebates  which consist primarily of volume rebates  are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscals  and  respectively 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
our endoscopy products and services are sold primarily to distributors internationally and directly to hospitals and other end users in the united states  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  laboratories  medical products and service companies and other end users  the majority of our healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors and with respect to some of our sterility assurance products  to hospitals  surgery centers  physician and dental offices  dental schools  medical research companies  laboratories and other end users  the majority of our dialysis products are sold to dialysis clinics and hospitals  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in accordance with accounting standards update asu  intangibles goodwill and other  asu  we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount before proceeding to step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test  if necessary 
such qualitative factors that are assessed include evaluating a segment s financial performance  industry and market conditions  macroeconomic conditions and specific issues that can directly affect the segment such as changes in business strategies  competition  supplier relationships  operating costs  regulatory matters  litigation and the composition of the segment s assets due to acquisitions or other events 
at july   because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our endoscopy  water purification and filtration and dialysis segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value  we did not proceed to step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for those three segments 
we performed step one of the two step quantitative goodwill impairment test for healthcare disposables due to the increase in assets related to the sps medical acquisition and specialty packaging due to fair value exceeding book value by a nominal amount in the prior year 
in performing a detailed quantitative review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using weighted fair value results of the discounted cash flow methodology  as well as the market multiple and comparable transaction methodologies 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in accordance with asu  intangibles goodwill and other  asu  we perform our annual impairment review for indefinite lived intangibles by first assessing qualitative factors  such as those described above  to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of such assets is less than the carrying values  and if necessary  we perform a quantitative analysis comparing the current fair value of our indefinite lived intangibles assets to their carrying values 
at july   because we determined through qualitative factors that the fair values of our indefinite lived intangible assets in our endoscopy and water purification and filtration segments were unlikely to be less than the carrying value  we did not perform a quantitative analysis for those assets 
we performed a quantitative analysis for indefinite lived intangible assets in our healthcare disposables and specialty packaging segments  for the same reasons stated above for our goodwill impairment test  as well as such intangible assets in our dialysis segment due to fair value of its indefinite lived intangible assets exceeding book value by a nominal amount in the prior year 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether expected future non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows which management believes to be reasonable  discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer companies 
assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales and earnings forecasts 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
at july   the average fair value of all of our reporting units exceeded book value by substantial amounts  except our specialty packaging segment  which had an average estimated fair value that approximated book value 
at july   goodwill relating to our specialty packaging reporting unit was  we believe the most significant assumptions impacting the impairment assessment of specialty packaging relate to an assumed compounded annual sales growth of and future operating efficiencies included in our projections of future operating results and cash flows of this segment  which projections are in excess of historical run rates 
if future operating results and cash flows are substantially less than our projections  future impairment charges may be recorded 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective 
on july   management concluded that no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the carrying amount of our long lived assets may not be recoverable 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and stock awards in which stock compensation expense is recognized for any option or stock award grant based upon the award s fair value 
all of our stock options and stock awards which consist only of restricted stock are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  modifications to existing awards  accelerated vesting related to certain employment terminations and assumptions used in determining fair value  expected lives and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which historically has been and is now approximately as we began paying dividends in january  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
it is our policy to accrue for amounts related to these legal matters if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these pending claims or legal actions will have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions as well as net operating loss carryforwards 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
a review of our deferred tax items considers known future changes in various income tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the income tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states and to a lesser extent canada  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties are recognized in our results of operations 
unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability 
medical device taxes the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act of imposes significant new taxes on medical device makers in the form of an excise tax on certain us medical device sales that began in january a significant portion of our sales are considered medical device sales under this new legislation 
we calculate medical device excise taxes based on the latest available regulations and irs notices and recognize the excise taxes in cost of sales at the time the medical device revenue is recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
in fiscal  we recorded excise taxes of  in cost of sales 
the regulations regarding the calculations of the medical device taxes are complicated in nature and certain aspects can be subject to interpretation causing the irs to issue notices clarifying various aspects of these new taxes 
although we have made all reasonable efforts to record accurate excise taxes  the determination of the tax requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates 
actual taxes for the period could differ from original estimates requiring adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we determine fair value based on the estimated price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include contingent consideration  certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
we account for contingent consideration relating to business combinations in accordance with asc  business combinations  which requires us to record the fair value of contingent consideration as a liability and an increase to goodwill at the date of the acquisition and continually re measure the liability at each balance sheet date by recording changes in the fair value through our consolidated statements of income 
we determine the fair value of contingent consideration based on future operating projections under various potential scenarios and weight the probability of these outcomes 
similarly  other components of an acquisition s purchase price can be required to be recorded at fair value at the date of the acquisition and continually re measured at each balance sheet date  such as the three year price floor relating to the byrne acquisition which fair value was determined using an option valuation model  as further described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the ultimate settlement of liabilities relating to business combinations may be for amounts which are materially different from the amounts initially recorded and may cause volatility in our results of operations 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and executive severance and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products in all of our business segments are exported to and imported from a variety of geographic locations  and our business could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting all of such geographies including but not limited to the united states  canada  the european union  the united kingdom and the far east 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar also affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our canadian and united states subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or canadian dollars but must be converted into their functional currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in the value of the euro  singapore dollar and british pound against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because certain cash bank accounts  accounts receivable and liabilities of our subsidiaries are denominated and ultimately settled in euros  singapore dollars or british pounds but must be converted into their functional currency 
furthermore  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note of the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of i the euro relative to the united states dollar  ii the singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar and iii the british pound relative to the united states dollar on the conversion of such net assets into the functional currencies  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros  singapore dollars and british pounds forward  which contracts are one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedge instruments 
there were three foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate value of  at july   which covered certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
such contracts expired on august  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our subsidiaries that are denominated and ultimately settled in currencies other than their functional currencies 
in fiscal  such forward contracts substantially offset the impact on operations relating to certain assets and liabilities that were denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
we do not currently hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar because the currency impact on our canadian and united states subsidiaries assets closely offset the currency impact on our canadian and united states subsidiaries liabilities effectively minimizing realized gains and losses 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange had an insignificant impact on our net income in fiscals and  and stockholders equity from july  to july  interest rate market risk we have united states credit facilities for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are under libor contracts 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states as well as libor interest rates 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements in february in which we agree to exchange our variable interest cash flows with fixed interest cash flows provided by one of our existing senior lenders 
with respect to our term loan facility  the interest rate swap is for the period that began august  and ends july   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
with respect to our revolving credit facility  the interest rate swap is for the period that began august  and ends january   initially covering  of borrowings based on one month libor and thereafter reducing semi annually by increments of  and the fixed interest cash flow is at a one month libor rate of 
therefore  we are substantially protected from exposure associated with increasing libor rates in future years 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our us credit facility  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facility consists of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
as a result of entering into forward starting interest rate swap agreements  our interest rate exposure is limited to the outstanding portion of our revolving credit facility in excess of  based on our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of  at august   a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would result in incremental annual interest expense of  however  we also maintain a cash balance of  at july  which is maintained in cash or invested in low return cash equivalents such as united states money market funds with leading banking institutions 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income  which would partially offset the adverse impact of additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar as these currencies relate to the united states dollar 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and singapore subsidiary have net assets in currencies other than their functional currencies  which must be converted into functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
similarly  our united states subsidiaries have net assets in currencies other than their functional united states currency  which must be converted into functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
however  since certain of our subsidiaries use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the canadian dollar  euro  british pound and singapore dollar relative to the united states dollar  realized gains or losses relating to the fluctuation of those currencies would be partially offset by gains or losses on the foreign currency forward contracts 
furthermore  changes in the value of the canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar affect our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary s inventories and operating costs are purchased in the united states and a portion of our canadian subsidiaries sales are to customers in the united states 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries 
overall for fiscals and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  primarily due to increases in the value of the canadian dollar and euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  as explained above  the use of foreign currency forward contracts would partially offset such realized losses 
in addition  such an adverse change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  a uniform favorable movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscals and  respectively  and an unrealized loss of  and  in fiscals and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term
