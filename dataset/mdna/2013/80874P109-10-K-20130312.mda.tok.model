printed products retail sales of instant tickets can be a key performance indicator of our instant ticket revenue  although there may not always be a direct correlation between retail sales and our instant ticket revenue due to the type of contract eg  ppk versus pos or csp contracts  the impact of changes in our customer contracts  the performance of our licensed properties business or other factors 
based on third party data  our customers total instant ticket lottery retail sales in the us increased for the year ended december  compared to most of our us customers reported year over year growth in retail sales of instant lottery tickets  which we believe was driven by a variety of factors  including product innovation  better instant ticket product management  prize payout increases  lottery private management and sales of higher price point tickets 
we believe that  as of the date of this annual report on form k  us instant ticket retail sales during the first quarter of appear to be soft relative to the first quarter of  when us retail sales of instant tickets grew over 
our licensed game contracts are generally game specific and therefore short term and non recurring 
our instant ticket revenue may be negatively impacted to the extent we are unable to continue to win licensed game specific or multi state game contracts 
there has been increased interest within the lottery industry in player loyalty programs  which we believe may result in further growth opportunities for our properties plus loyalty program  which features players clubs  reward programs  second chance promotional websites and interactive games 
during  we commenced new properties plus programs for four lotteries for a total of seven active programs as of december  in february  the maryland lottery signed an agreement with us for a properties plus program and we are in active discussions with several other lotteries regarding these programs  both in the us and internationally 
we are the primary supplier of instant lottery tickets for lns  in which we have a equity investment  which was awarded the concession to be the exclusive operator of the italian gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery beginning on october  over the life of the concession  we expect that we will supply no less than of lns instant ticket production requirements 
retail sales for lns for the year ended december  declined by approximately compared to  which we believe was due in part to a decline in consumer spending related to difficult economic conditions and tax increases in italy 
we also faced challenging year over year retail sales comparisons for the year ended december  in light of the strong retail sales performance of the italian instant ticket lottery during the prior year 
northstar  in which we have a equity investment  commenced operations as the private manager of the illinois lottery on july  under the pma with the state of illinois 
under our csp agreement with northstar  we are responsible for the design  development  manufacturing  warehousing and distribution of instant lottery tickets and are compensated based on a percentage of retail sales 
illinois lottery instant ticket sales increased approximately for the year ended december  our pos based instant lottery ticket revenue for the year ended december  reflected our csp agreement with northstar which commenced on july  northstar is entitled to reimbursement on a monthly basis for most of its operating expenses under the pma  although certain expenses of northstar associated with managing the lottery are not reimbursable 
northstar is also entitled to receive annual incentive compensation payments from the state to the extent it is successful in increasing the lottery net income as defined in the pma above specified target levels  subject to a cap of of the applicable year net income 
northstar will be responsible for payments to the state to the extent such targets are not achieved  subject to a similar cap 
the lottery net income targets set forth in northstar successful bid for the pma were million  million  million  million and billion for the five fiscal years ending june     and  respectively  representing a cumulative growth rate in lottery net income over such time period of approximately 
these net income target levels are subject to upward or downward adjustment under certain circumstances in accordance with the terms of the pma 
northstar may seek downward adjustments to the net income targets in the event certain actions of the state or the federal government have a material adverse effect on the lottery net income and northstar ability to receive incentive compensation payments 
on november   an arbitrator determined that northstar is entitled to a million downward adjustment to the net income target for the lottery fiscal year and a million downward adjustment to the net income target for the lottery fiscal year 
we understand that the state has objected to the arbitrator determination 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  it is unclear if these adjusted net income targets are final or subject to further review or adjustment 
accordingly  as of the date of this annual report on form k  northstar is unable to estimate  and therefore has not recorded  any amounts in respect of annual incentive compensation or net income shortfall payments for the year ended december  as us and international jurisdictions increasingly look towards lottery and gaming as a source to grow revenue  we believe there will be continued interest in pursuing an outsourcing model whereby the day to day management of lotteries are conducted by a third party  similar to the pma model in illinois 
to the extent any of our lottery customers enter into a private management agreement  such lottery customer or the private manager may terminate our existing contract s with the lottery customer as part of the transition to the private management model 
the indiana lottery recently awarded a private management agreement to one of our competitors 
we expect to enter into an instant ticket lottery contract with the manager of the indiana lottery that is expected to commence in april following the expiration of our current instant ticket lottery contract with the indiana lottery 
we recently assisted the commonwealth of pennsylvania in its potential procurement of a private management agreement for the pennsylvania lottery 
in light of our role in the process  we did not bid for the private management agreement in pennsylvania 
on january   the commonwealth issued a notice of award of the private management agreement to a bidder 
on february   the pennsylvania attorney general rejected the agreement as unlawful 
we cannot be certain as to the status of the private management agreement or what the ultimate resolution of this privatization effort will be at this time 
under our current contracts with the pennsylvania lottery  we are the exclusive provider of instant lottery tickets and lottery systems and services in pennsylvania through august and december  respectively 
in december  we formed northstar new jersey with gtech and omers to bid to be the private manager for the new jersey lottery for a year term 
if northstar new jersey is selected as the private manager  we expect to own a equity interest in the joint venture entity that will execute the private management agreement 
following a strategic review of our global instant lottery ticket business  we commenced a reorganization plan on april  to cease all printing and finishing activities at our australia facility  and during the second half of we migrated printing for customers in this region to our other manufacturing facilities 
we recorded approximately million of employee termination and other restructuring costs associated with the reorganization for the year ended december  other restructuring costs include approximately million resulting from vacating our facility 
in addition  we recorded approximately million of accelerated depreciation for equipment related to this reorganization 
we do not expect to incur additional material costs or accelerated depreciation related to this reorganization 
on june   we acquired of the equity interests of provoloto for approximately million  subject to certain adjustments  including an estimated earn out payable to the sellers of approximately million contingent on the future performance of the acquired business 
provoloto develops and distributes instant lottery tickets and manages instant ticket lotteries for mexican charities 
we expect this acquisition to strengthen our presence in latin america and create a platform for further expansion in the region 
the operating results of provoloto have been included in our printed products segment and have been consolidated in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations in on december   the hellenic republic asset development fund provisionally awarded the consortium in which we own a equity interest a year concession for the exclusive rights to the production  operation and management of instant ticket lotteries in greece 
the consortium is principally comprised of opap sa  scientific games and intralot 
the concession will cover current and future instant lotteries which are conducted using physical tickets  as well as internet sales of physical tickets 
operations under the new concession are subject to various regulatory approvals and greek parliamentary approval 
we will be responsible for providing instant lottery ticket marketing services to the lotteries and expect to enter into a supply agreement for the exclusive provision of all instant ticket production and game design services to the consortium 
if the award is approved  the consortium will pay an upfront payment of million  of which our portion will be million  and will be responsible for a monthly fee to the lotteries equal to a percentage of gross gaming revenue 
according to third party data  in  opap generated billion in total lottery retail sales in greece  representing approximately in per capita sales  making it the third largest lottery in the world in terms of per capita sales based on third party data 
the instant ticket lottery has been inactive since lottery systems retail sales of draw games can be a key performance indicator of our lottery systems service revenue  although there may not always be a direct correlation between retail sales and our lottery systems revenue due to the terms of contract  the impact of changes in our customer contracts or other factors 
based on third party data  our lottery systems customers total draw game retail sales in the us increased for the year ended december  compared to our lottery systems service revenue in the us increased for the year ended december  compared to due in part to this improvement in us retail sales 
the level of jackpots of the powerball and mega millions multi state draw lottery games have an impact on us retail sales  and therefore  our service revenue in any given period 
we believe that  as of the date of this annual report on form k  us draw game retail sales during the first quarter of appear to be soft relative to the first quarter of  when us retail sales of draw games grew nearly 
in  us lottery directors authorized certain changes to the powerball game  including an increase in the ticket price to  which went into effect on january  the industry experienced the largest powerball jackpot in history million and the largest mega millions jackpot in history million during the year ended december  our lottery systems service revenue is also impacted by retail sales of instant lottery tickets where we provide instant lottery ticket validation services as part of a lottery systems contract 
our lottery systems sales revenue primarily relates to one time sales of equipment and is non recurring in nature 
in june  we executed a four year extension of our contract to provide lottery systems and services  along with instant tickets  to loteria electronica in puerto rico 
in june  we executed a one year extension of our lottery systems contract with the maine lottery 
in august  maine issued a lottery systems and instant lottery ticket rfp that we responded to in october we understand the state is still evaluating the bids it received 
the indiana lottery recently awarded a private management agreement to one of our competitors 
we expect that our lottery systems contract with the indiana lottery will be terminated in connection with the commencement of the private management model in indiana 
on january   we entered into an agreement with the new manager of the indiana lottery to provide existing lottery systems equipment and services through august which is expected to commence in april on february   we executed a five year extension of our lottery systems contract with the connecticut lottery 
we are the exclusive instant ticket validation network provider to the csl 
the pos rate we receive under our china instant ticket validation contract decreased by in january and is scheduled to decrease by an additional in january  in accordance with the contract 
in china  we have seen a recent decline in our instant ticket validation revenue and our joint venture instant ticket printing revenue as instant ticket retail sales of the csl decreased approximately for the year ended december  compared to we continue to believe there is sustained consumer demand for lottery products in china  as retail sales of the entire lottery segment grew by in compared to  but that competition from other lottery products is impacting instant ticket sales 
we remain focused on improving sales trends by expanding the lottery retailer network and increasing our involvement in the game selection process 
we believe it will take some time for any such actions to take effect 
to the extent we are not able to successfully implement these remedial actions and offset our csl contract rate reductions by retail sales growth  our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected 
on april   we signed a five year agreement in china to provide sales and distribution management services to the hubei sports lottery 
the agreement is similar to the csp contracts we have with many of our north american and european customers 
we expect that these services will assist the hubei sports lottery in achieving higher retail sales and lower operating costs 
we expect operations under the contract to commence in we entered into a contract  effective in december  to design  implement and administer our aegis video central management and control system cmcs for the illinois gaming board

the acquired assets include technology that we expect to integrate into our lottery systems business and our interactive game platform as part of an expanded service offering to lottery customers 
the operating results of parspro have been included in our lottery systems segment and have been consolidated in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  gaming in our uk gaming terminal business  our compensation is typically based on gross win ie  amount bet less player winnings generated by our gaming terminals subject to certain adjustments as may be specified in a particular contract  including adjustments for taxes and other fees 
our gaming service revenue is therefore impacted by the size of our installed gaming terminal base and the gross win generated by our terminals 
our gaming sales revenue is generally non recurring in nature 
our uk lbo contracts generally have initial terms of two to four years with potential extensions 
our gross win per terminal per day increased approximately for the year ended december  compared to we had an installed base of approximately  and  lbo gaming terminals in the uk as of december  and  respectively 
in  we completed the migration of our server based gaming terminals in the uk to a new back end technology platform and migrated the majority of our server based gaming terminals outside the uk to this technology during as of june   we completed the installation of approximately  gaming terminals for the entire ladbrokes betting and gaming ltd 
lbo estate in accordance with the contract awarded to us in in january  william hill  a uk bookmaker  awarded a contract for the exclusive supply of gaming terminals to its entire lbo estate to one of our competitors

the operating results of ads have been included in our gaming segment and have been consolidated in our results of operations since the date of acquisition 
the acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year ended december  on september   we completed the acquisition of barcrest  a leading supplier of gaming content  platforms and systems to gaming operators in the uk and continental europe  including pubs  lbos  bingo halls and arcades 
the acquisition provides us with an expansive library of gaming titles and properties  as well as an existing base of business in interactive gaming in which barcrest game content is made available through internet  mobile and other digital delivery channels 
we had an installed base of approximately  and  gaming terminals in our uk pub  bingo hall and arcade business as of december  and  respectively 
the comparability of our results of operations with our results of operations is impacted by the barcrest acquisition 
in january  following a comprehensive strategic review  we announced our exit from the barcrest analog terminal business in order to focus our game design and other resources solely on our digital server based supply model 
we also reorganized our pub business in an effort to more effectively capitalize on the barcrest acquisition 
in  we recorded approximately million of employee termination and restructuring costs associated with the reorganization 
other restructuring costs include approximately million resulting from vacating facilities 
we do not expect to incur additional material costs or accelerated depreciation related to this reorganization 
we continue to review strategic alternatives for our pub business 
we continue to seek to expand our server based gaming terminal business outside the uk  with current deployments in the caribbean  czech republic  mexico and puerto rico 
we had an installed base of approximately  and  gaming terminals outside of the uk as of december  and  respectively 
in april  approximately  video lottery terminals operated by snai in italy and supplied by barcrest were deactivated following the erroneous printing of what appeared to be winning jackpot and other tickets 
the deactivation of the terminals negatively impacted the gaming results of operations during see legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k for further information in late  the uk government announced its intention to change the taxation of gaming machines by replacing the currently applicable amusement machine license duty and the value added tax with a new machine games duty  or mgd  based on the gross win generated by a gaming machine 
in a budget statement issued in march  the uk government announced a standard mgd rate of on gross win  effective february  these tax changes may negatively impact our gaming machine customers businesses and  therefore  could negatively impact our business in competition and foreign currency risk we believe we are likely to continue to experience a highly competitive environment for us and international customer contracts in connection with bids  re bids  extensions and renewals  which could lead to loss of contracts  rate or volume reductions and additional service requirements in contracts that we win or retain 
see the table business contract procurement in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our customer contracts  including when they may become subject to re bid  extension  or renewal 
our strategy to mitigate these industry trends includes working with our customers to grow their sales through a variety of methods including launching new products and services  implementing innovative technologies and marketing tools  and expanding retail distribution 
we derived approximately and of our annual revenue from sales to customers outside of the us in and  respectively and are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
the british pound sterling and the euro represented  respectively  approximately million  or  and million  or  of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  historically  foreign currency fluctuations have impacted our revenue more than our expenses  as a portion of our raw materials  such as paper  ink and point of sale terminals are contracted for in us dollars 
we also have foreign currency exposure related to certain of our equity investments 
our earnings from our euro denominated equity investment in lns were million for the year ended december  our foreign currency exposure from equity investments denominated in other foreign currencies was not material in the aggregate for the year ended december  when we refer to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we are referring to the difference between the current period rates and the prior period rates applied to the current period activity 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by securing payment from our customers in the functional currency of the selling subsidiary when possible  entering into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  net investments and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies to the extent possible 
during  we entered into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge a portion of the net investment in one of our subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
these foreign currency forward contracts are described in note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
recently issued accounting guidance in may  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued guidance to clarify the intent of the application of existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and amend certain requirements for measuring fair value or for disclosing information about fair value measurements 
the guidance limits the highest and best use measure to non financial assets  permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions in market or counter party credit risks to be measured at a net basis  and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and discounts in fair value measurement 
additionally  for fair value measurements categorized within level of the fair value hierarchy  the new guidance clarifies that quantitative disclosure about unobservable inputs should be disclosed and requires a description of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value measurements to changes in unobservable inputs and the interrelationships between those inputs 
we adopted the guidance on january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income 
the guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of stockholders equity 
instead  an entity is required to present net income and other comprehensive income either in one continuous statement or in two separate but consecutive statements 
we adopted the guidance on january   resulting in a change in the presentation of comprehensive income for the years ended december   and in february  the fasb issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income to improve the reporting of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the guidance is effective prospectively for reporting periods beginning after december  and early adoption is permitted

for other amounts that are not required under us gaap to be reclassified in their entirety to net income  an entity is required to cross reference to other disclosures required under us gaap that provide additional detail about those amounts 
we adopted the new guidance on january  in september  the fasb issued guidance on testing goodwill for impairment 
the guidance provides an entity with the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
if an entity determines that this is the case  it is required to perform the currently prescribed two step goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized for that reporting unit if any 
if an entity determines the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  then the two step goodwill impairment test is not required 
we adopted the guidance on january  the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued guidance on testing indefinite lived intangible assets  other than goodwill  for impairment 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  and early adoption is permitted

if  after assessing the totality of events and circumstances  an entity concludes that it is not more likely than not that the indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  then the entity is not required to take further action 
however  if an entity concludes otherwise  then it is required to perform the currently prescribed quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value of the asset with the carrying amount

critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap  with no need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensing branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prizes on behalf of lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized as a multiple deliverable arrangement 
there are typically two deliverables in the arrangement  the license and the merchandising services  which are separate units of accounting 
we allocate revenue to the deliverables based on their relative selling prices 
revenue allocated to the license is recognized when the use of the licensed property is permitted  typically when the contract is signed 
revenue allocated to the merchandising services is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations of the merchandising services to the customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to the merchandising services 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total costs of merchandising services which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the revenue allocated to the merchandising services and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using the cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenue under percentage of completion contracts is recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock based awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock options are determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differs from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we may grant certain stock based awards that are contingent upon the company achieving certain financial performance targets 
upon determining the performance target is probable  the fair value of the award is recognized over the service period  subject to potential adjustment 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review for our long lived and intangible assets or goodwill include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
long lived and intangible assets recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the expected net future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by that asset or  for identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives  by determining whether the amortization of the intangible asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through expected net future undiscounted cash flows 
the amount of impairment of other long lived assets is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair market value  less expected costs to sell 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a quantitative two step impairment test 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
in the event that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the amount of the impairment loss will be measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units  we applied a number of methodologies consistent with our prior year approach  including the income approach based on a discounted cash flow dcf analysis and the market approach using implied public and private multiples 
specifically  we applied multiples where comparable companies publicly trade and relevant historical acquisition transactions 
in arriving at a valuation of our reporting units  we weighted each of these methodologies equally 
our dcf analysis is based on the present value of two components the sum of our projected cash flows and a terminal value assuming a perpetual growth rate of 
the cash flow estimates are derived from our budget and long term forecasts prepared for each reporting unit  considering historical results and anticipated future performance 
the discount rates used to determine the present value of future cash flows were derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis wacc utilizing a beta that is derived from the same group of comparable companies used in our multiple analysis 
in addition  we gave consideration in the calculation of the wacc for the size and specific industry risks of each of our reporting units 
the discount rate used for each reporting unit ranged from to for and to for due to changes in our management authority structure in  we changed the designation of our chief operating decision maker codm as defined under accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc 
as a result  we determined that we have seven operating segments based on the financial information regularly reviewed by the codm  which we also determined represent our reporting units as defined under asc we considered whether additional reporting units exist within an operating segment based on the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by segment management  and determined that our seven operating segments equate to our seven reporting units 
our seven reporting units are printed products  licensed properties  us lottery systems  international lottery systems  china lottery  video systems  and gaming 
previously we had three operating segments and reporting units as of december  and therefore the identification of seven reporting units required the reallocation of the goodwill balance to each reporting unit based on a relative fair value approach in accordance with asc our goodwill totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allocation of goodwill to each reporting unit as of december  is as follows in millions reporting unit printed products licensed properties us lottery systems international lottery systems china lottery video systems gaming total goodwill our annual impairment valuation as of december  produced estimated fair values of equity for all of our reporting units under our old and new structures in excess of the carrying value of equity for all of our reporting units 
the estimated fair values of equity for each of our printed products  licensed properties  international lottery systems  china lottery and video systems reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying value of such reporting unit 
although the estimated fair value of equity for our us lottery and gaming reporting units were in excess of the respective carrying value  to illustrate the sensitivity of these reporting units  a decrease in the fair value of equity of more than for our us lottery systems or more than for our gaming reporting unit could potentially result in an impairment of goodwill 
the estimate of a reporting unit fair value requires the use of several assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit future cash flows  growth rates  market comparables and weighted average cost of capital  among others 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects such as changes in our strategy or products  the loss of key customers  regulatory licensing or adverse changes in economic and market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value valuation of our reporting units and could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
income taxes and deferred income taxes income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the company tax expense includes the us and international income taxes but excludes the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries deemed to be permanently invested 
the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
at december   the company had a valuation allowance of million recorded against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and us subsidiaries 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions 
the reversal of the accruals is recorded when examinations are completed  statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed 
changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future 
the american taxpayer relief act of the act was signed into law on january  because a change in tax law is accounted for in the period of enactment  the provisions of the act that are expected to impact the company u 
s tax return eg  the research and experimentation credit cannot be recognized in the company financial statements and instead will be reflected in the company financial statements 
because the company has recorded a valuation allowance against the benefit of its u 
s net deferred tax assets  we do not expect the provisions of the act to have a material impact on the company financial statements 
liquidity  capital sources and working capital sources of liquidity at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facility discussed below under credit agreement and other debt 
at december   our available cash and cash equivalents and borrowing capacity totaled million including cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under the revolving credit facility compared to million at december  including cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
however  at december   we had million in outstanding letters of credit  which reduces the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the amount of our available cash and cash equivalents fluctuates principally based on borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities  investments  acquisitions and changes in our working capital position 
our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will depend on outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility and will depend on our remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our credit agreement  including the maintenance of our financial ratios and other covenants 
we were in compliance with the covenants under our credit agreement as of december  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future excluding the pending wms transaction  which will require new financing as contemplated by the commitment letter we have entered into in connection with such transaction  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we believe that substantially all cash held outside the us is free from legal encumbrances or similar restrictions that would prevent it from being available to meet the company global liquidity needs 
the company intention is to reinvest undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries to fund operations in the us total cash held by our foreign subsidiaries was million as of december  to the extent that a portion of our foreign cash were required to meet liquidity needs in the us  we might incur a tax liability  the timing and amount of which would depend on a variety of factors 
a significant amount of the cash held by our foreign subsidiaries as of december  could be transferred to the us as repayments of intercompany loans and we have significant foreign tax credit carryovers that would be available to reduce any potential us tax liability 
our contracts are periodically subject to renewal and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations if our existing contracts are not renewed or are renewed on less favorable terms  or if we are unable to enter into additional contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each lottery contract 
as of december   we had arranged for the issuance of a total of million of surety bonds in respect of outstanding contracts to which we and or our subsidiaries are parties 
we have reimbursement or indemnification obligations with respect to these bonds in the event that the sureties are required to make payment and  in some cases  such bonds are supported by springing liens  solely on those assets related to the performance of the relevant contractual obligations  that may attach in certain circumstances 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to the company financial condition and by prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all

includes certain other long term liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and our current liability related to our licensed properties business license obligation as of december  we have excluded approximately million of long term pension plan and other post retirement liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million and liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
periodically  we bid on new lottery systems contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant upfront capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically  we have funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to commit to new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates in order to finance the upfront costs 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires us to maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed terminal base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations other than in the ordinary course of business

we may be required to make capital contributions to northstar to fund our pro rata share ie  based on our percentage interest in northstar of any shortfall payments that may be owed by northstar to the state under the pma 
northstar is expected to be reimbursed on a monthly basis for most of its operating expenses under the pma  although certain expenses of northstar associated with managing the lottery are not reimbursable 
in december  the company adopted the asia pacific plan

our accrual recorded in other long term liabilities related to the asia pacific plan was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
on december   the hellenic republic asset development fund provisionally awarded the consortium in which we own a equity interest a year concession for the exclusive rights to the production  operation and management of instant ticket lotteries in greece 
the consortium is principally comprised of opap sa  scientific games and intralot

in december  we formed northstar new jersey with gtech and omers to bid to be the private manager for the new jersey lottery for a year term 
we have entered into an operating agreement for the formation of northstar new jersey lottery group  llc  the entity that we will form with gtech and omers if northstar new jersey is selected as the private manager and which will be obligated to pay an upfront fee of million to the state of new jersey upon execution of the private management agreement

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to a concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits where appropriate  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal year  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
although we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and debt and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
see management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity  capital resources and working capital in item of this annual report on form k for additional information about our financial instruments 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands twelve months ended december thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in austria  chile  china  germany  ireland  italy  mexico  canada  china  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our international operations is incurred in local currencies 
although we provide technology based products  systems and services to gaming industries worldwide  some of our transactions and their resulting financial impact are transacted in us dollars 
the foreign currencies to which we have the most exposure are the euro and the british pound sterling  representing approximately and  respectively  of our non u 
s dollar revenues in historically  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been more significant with respect to revenues than expenses  as a significant portion of our expenses  such as paper and ink  are contracted for in us dollars 
at december   a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling would result in a decrease in revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  and a decrease in operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also have foreign currency exposure related to certain of our equity investments 
our earnings from our euro denominated equity investment in lns were million for the year ended december  our foreign currency exposure from equity investments denominated in other foreign currencies was not material in the aggregate for the year ended december  we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by securing payment from our customers in the functional currency of the selling subsidiary when possible  entering into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  net investments and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies to the extent possible 
during the year ended december   we entered into foreign currency forward contracts for the sale of euros for us dollars to hedge a portion of the net investment in one of our subsidiaries that is denominated in euros 
some of these foreign currency forward contracts settled in as of december   we had foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million and a weighted average exchange rate of approximately that are scheduled to settle in may we did not have any derivative instruments as of december  our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in a variety of governmental or institutional securities with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
