the company defines stabilized occupancy as the earlier to occur of i the attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or ii one year after completion of construction 
represents unit status as of february  in addition  the company may commence development activities at more of its existing land sites over the next year or so 
management believes  however  that the timing of such development starts will depend largely on a continued favorable outlook for multi family apartment rentals and capital market conditions and the us economy 
until such time as additional development activities commence or certain land positions are sold  the company expects that operating results will be adversely impacted by costs of carrying land held for future investment or sale

index to financial statements condominium activities at december   the company was selling for sale condominium homes in two communities 
the four seasons private residences  austin the austin condominium project consists of homes  of which three homes were under contract and units were closed as of february  the company s other condominium project  the ritz carlton residences  atlanta buckhead the atlanta condominium project  consists of homes 
there were units under contract and units were closed at the atlanta condominium project at february  units under contract listed above include all units currently under contract 
however  the company has experienced contract terminations in prior condominium projects and may experience additional terminations in connection with existing projects 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that units under contract for sale will actually close 
the company recognized impairment charges in and prior years to write down the company s investments in these two properties to their estimated fair value 
these impairment charges are discussed further in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k 
competition all of the company s apartment and for sale condominium communities are located in developed markets that include other upscale apartments and for sale condominium projects owned by numerous public and private companies 
some of these companies may have substantially greater resources and greater access to capital than the company  allowing them to grow at rates greater than the company 
the number of competitive upscale apartment and for sale condominium properties and companies in a particular market could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease apartment units at its apartment communities  including any newly developed or acquired communities  and on the rents charged  and could have a material effect on the company s ability to sell for sale condominium units and on the selling prices of such units 
in addition  other forms of residential properties  including single family housing and town homes  provide housing alternatives to potential residents of upscale apartment communities or potential purchasers of for sale condominium units 
the company competes for residents in its apartment communities based on its high level of resident service  the quality of its apartment communities including its landscaping and amenity offerings and the desirability of its locations 
resident leases at its apartment communities are priced competitively based on market conditions  supply and demand characteristics  and the quality and resident service offerings of its communities 
the company does not seek to compete on the basis of providing the low cost solution for all residents 
americans with disabilities act and fair housing act the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act the ada to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as multi family housing communities  to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply with the fair housing act the fha  which requires that apartment communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons with disabilities 
noncompliance with the fha and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fha could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of multi family housing units covered under the fha 
in addition to the ada and fha  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future  as well as interpretations of the ada and fha by courts  may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fha  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs

index to financial statements in recent years  there has been heightened scrutiny of the multi family housing industry for compliance with the requirements of the fha and ada 
in september  the united states department of justice the doj filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
the suit alleges various violations of the fha and the ada at properties designed  constructed or operated by the company in the district of columbia  virginia  florida  georgia  new york  north carolina and texas 
the plaintiff seeks statutory damages and a civil penalty in unspecified amounts  as well as injunctive relief that includes retrofitting apartments and public use areas to comply with the fha and the ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
the company filed a motion to transfer the case to the united states district court for the district of columbia  where a previous civil case involving alleged violations of the fha and ada by the company was filed and ultimately dismissed 
on october   the united states district court for the northern district of georgia issued an opinion finding that the complaint shows that the doj s claims are essentially the same as the previous civil case  and  therefore  granted the company s motion and transferred the doj s case to the united states district court for the district of columbia 
limited discovery is proceeding 
under the court s scheduling order  the deadline for completion of discovery is november and briefing of any dispositive motions would be accomplished by march due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fha or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are not likely covered by insurance policies 
the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
environmental regulations the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations that apply to the development of real property  including construction activities  the ownership of real property  and the operation of multi family apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has instituted a policy that requires an environmental investigation of each property that it considers for purchase or that it owns and plans to develop 
the environmental investigation is conducted by a qualified third party environmental consultant in accordance with recognized industry standards 
the environmental investigation report is reviewed by the company and counsel prior to purchase and or development of any property 
if the environmental investigation identifies evidence of potentially significant environmental contamination that merits additional investigation  sampling of the property is performed by the environmental consultant 
if necessary  remediation or mitigation of contamination  including removal of contaminated soil and or underground storage tanks  placement of impervious barriers  or creation of land use or deed restrictions  is undertaken either prior to development or at another appropriate time 
when performing remediation activities  the company is subject to a variety of environmental requirements 
in some cases  the company obtains state approval of the selected remediation and mitigation measures by entering into voluntary environmental cleanup programs administered by state agencies 
in developing properties and constructing apartment and for sale condominium communities  the company utilizes independent environmental consultants to determine whether there are any flood plains  wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas that are part of the property to be developed 
if flood plains are identified  development and construction work is planned so that flood plain areas are preserved or alternative flood plain capacity is created in conformance with federal and local flood plain management requirements 
if wetlands or other environmentally sensitive areas are identified  the company plans and conducts its development and construction activities and obtains the necessary permits and authorizations in compliance with applicable legal standards 
in some cases  however  the presence of wetlands and or other environmentally sensitive areas could preclude  severely limit  or otherwise alter the proposed site development and construction activities 
storm water discharge from a construction site is subject to the storm water permit requirements mandated under the clean water act 
in most jurisdictions  the state administers the permit programs 
the company currently anticipates that it will be able to obtain and materially comply with any storm water permits required for new development 
the company has obtained and is in material compliance with the construction site storm water permits required for its existing development activities

index to financial statements the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and comparable state laws subject the owner or operator of real property or a facility and persons who arranged for off site disposal activities to claims or liability for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances that are released at  in  on  under  or from real property or a facility 
in addition to claims for cleanup costs  the presence of hazardous substances on or the release of hazardous substances from a property or a facility could result in a claim by a private party for personal injury or property damage or could result in a claim from a governmental agency for other damages  including natural resource damages 
liability under cercla and comparable state laws can be imposed on the owner or the operator of real property or a facility without regard to fault or even knowledge of the release of hazardous substances and other regulated materials on  at  in  under  or from the property or facility 
environmental liabilities associated with hazardous substances also could be imposed on the company under other applicable environmental laws  such as the resource conservation and recovery act and comparable state laws  or common law principles 
the presence of hazardous substances in amounts requiring response action or the failure to undertake necessary remediation may adversely affect the owner s ability to use or sell real estate or borrow money using such real estate as collateral 
various environmental laws govern certain aspects of the company s ongoing operation of its communities 
such environmental laws include those regulating the existence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  management of surfaces with lead based paint and notices to residents about the lead based paint  use of active underground petroleum storage tanks  and waste management activities 
the failure to comply with such requirements could subject the company to a government enforcement action and or claims for damages by a private party 
the company has not been notified by any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  claim or liability in connection with environmental conditions associated with any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities 
the company has not been notified of a material claim for personal injury or property damage by a private party relating to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities in connection with environmental conditions 
the company is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of its apartment and for sale condominium communities that could be considered to be material 
it is possible  however  that the environmental investigations of the company s properties might not have revealed all potential environmental liabilities associated with the company s real property and its apartment and for sale condominium communities or the company might have underestimated any potential environmental issues identified in the investigations 
it is also possible that future environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations or new interpretations of existing environmental laws  ordinances  or regulations will impose material environmental liabilities on the company  the current environmental conditions of properties that the company owns or operates will be affected adversely by hazardous substances associated with other nearby properties or the actions of third parties unrelated to the company  or our residents and or commercial tenants may engage in activities prohibited by their leases or otherwise expose the company to liability under applicable environmental laws  ordinances or regulations 
the costs of defending any future environmental claims  performing any future environmental remediation  satisfying any such environmental liabilities or responding to any changed environmental conditions could materially adversely affect the company s financial conditions and results of operations

table of contents 
index to financial statements majority of the company s apartment communities are located  may significantly affect occupancy levels and rental rates and therefore profitability 
a lack of economic growth may have a disproportionate impact on the company as discussed above 
in general  factors that may adversely affect market and economic conditions include the following the economic climate  which may be adversely impacted by a reduction in jobs  industry slowdowns and other factors  local conditions  such as oversupply of  or reduced demand for  apartment homes  declines in household formation  favorable residential mortgage rates  rent control or stabilization laws  or other laws regulating rental housing  which could prevent the company from raising rents to offset increases in operating costs  and competition from other available apartments and other housing alternatives and changes in market rental rates 
any of these factors would adversely affect the company s ability to achieve desired operating results from its communities 
development and construction risks could impact the company s profitability 
the company may develop and construct apartment communities 
the company is currently developing its post south lamar apartment community in austin  texas  its post parkside at wade apartment community in raleigh  north carolina  a second phase of its post carlyle square apartment community in alexandria  virginia  a third phase of its post midtown square apartment community in houston  texas  a third phase of its post lake at baldwin park apartment community in orlando  florida  its post richmond avenue community in houston  texas and its post soho square community in tampa  florida 
development activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures with unaffiliated parties 
the company s development and construction activities may be exposed to the following risks the company may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs  the company may incur construction costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  and the company may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs  the company may abandon development opportunities that it has already begun to explore  and it may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring those opportunities  causing potential impairment losses to be incurred  the company has at times been and may continue to be unable to complete construction and lease up of a community on schedule and meet financial goals for development projects  because occupancy rates and rents at a newly developed community may fluctuate depending on a number of factors  including market and economic conditions  the company may be unable to meet its profitability goals for that community  and land costs and construction costs have been volatile in the company s markets and may continue to be volatile in the future and  in some cases  the costs of upgrading acquired communities have  and may continue to  exceed original estimates and the company may be unable to charge rents that would compensate for these increases in costs 
possible difficulty of selling apartment communities could limit the company s operational and financial flexibility 
purchasers may not be willing to pay acceptable prices for apartment communities that the company wishes to sell 
a weak market may limit the company s ability to change its portfolio promptly in response to changing economic conditions 
furthermore  general uncertainty in the real estate markets may result in conditions where the pricing of certain real estate assets may be difficult due to uncertainty with respect to capitalization rates and valuations  among other things  which may add to the difficulty of potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire such properties on favorable terms or cause potential buyers to not complete acquisitions of such properties 
also  if the company is unable to sell apartment communities or if it can only sell apartment communities at prices lower than are generally acceptable  then the company may have to take on additional leverage in order to provide adequate capital to execute its development post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

index to financial statements and construction and acquisitions strategy 
furthermore  a portion of the proceeds from the company s overall property sales in the future may be held in escrow accounts in order for some sales to qualify as like kind exchanges under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code so that any related capital gain can be deferred for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  the company may not have immediate access to all of the cash flow generated from property sales 
the company is subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors due to the concentration of its investments in certain markets 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s operating communities were located in the atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  greater washington  dc and tampa  florida metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company s strategy in recent years has focused on reducing its concentration in atlanta  georgia and building critical mass in fewer markets 
the company is currently subject to increased exposure to economic and other competitive factors specific to its markets within these geographic areas 
economic slowdowns in the us and declines in the condominium and single family housing markets may negatively affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
there was a significant decline in economic growth  both in the us and globally  that began in and continued through although the real estate development industry and the us economy has seen gradual improvement beginning in  there can be no assurance that market conditions will remain or improve further in the near future 
negative trends may materially and adversely affect the company s revenues from its apartment communities 
the company s apartment communities compete with lower cost apartments in most markets 
the company s ability to lease its units in these communities at favorable rates  or at all  is dependent upon the overall level of spending  which is affected by  among other things  employment levels  recession  personal debt levels  conditions in the housing market  stock market volatility and uncertainty about the future 
the company may be disproportionately vulnerable to reduced spending arising from any economic downturn as compared to owners of lower cost apartment communities 
the rental of excess for sale condominiums and single family homes in an already competitive multi family market may also reduce the company s ability to lease its apartment units and depress rental rates in certain markets 
the excess in for sale condominiums in the company s markets also affects the company s profits in its for sale condominium business 
the market for the company s for sale condominium homes depends on an active demand for new for sale housing and high consumer confidence 
decline in demand  exacerbated by tighter credit standards for home buyers  has led to an oversupply of new for sale housing in recent years that has affected the price at which the company is able to sell condominium homes 
the company cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain at current levels  but if the markets do not significantly improve  the moderate pace of condominium sales and closings could remain during failure to generate sufficient cash flows could affect the company s debt financing and create refinancing risk 
the company is subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the risk that its cash flow will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest 
although the company may be able to use cash flow generated by its apartment communities or through the sale of for sale condominium housing to make future principal payments  it may not have sufficient cash flow available to make all required principal payments and still meet the distribution requirements that the company must satisfy in order to maintain its status as a real estate investment trust or reit for federal income tax purposes 
the following factors  among others  may affect the cash flows generated by the company s apartment communities and through the sale of for sale condominium housing the national and local economies  local real estate market conditions  such as an oversupply of apartment homes or competing for sale condominium housing  the perceptions by prospective residents or buyers of the safety  convenience and attractiveness of the company s communities and the neighborhoods in which they are located  the company s ability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance for its apartment communities  rental expenses for its apartment communities  including real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  and the level of mortgage interest rates and its impact on the demand for prospective buyers of for sale condominium housing

table of contents 
index to financial statements expenses associated with the company s investment in apartment communities  such as debt service  real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in cash flows from operations from that community 
if a community is mortgaged to secure payment of debt and the company is unable to make the mortgage payments  the company could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the community or the exercise of other remedies by the mortgagor 
the company is likely to need to refinance at least a portion of its outstanding debt as it matures 
there is a risk that the company may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt 
as of december   the company had outstanding mortgage indebtedness of  senior unsecured notes of  unsecured term loan indebtedness of  and no outstanding borrowings on its unsecured revolving lines of credit 
none of the company s indebtedness matures in or the company could become more highly leveraged  which could result in an increased risk of default and in an increase in its debt service requirements 
the company s stated goal is to generally maintain total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets to not more than  to generally limit variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness to not more than and to maintain adequate liquidity through the company s available cash and unsecured lines of credit 
at december   the company s total effective leverage debt and preferred equity as a percentage of undepreciated real estate assets and the company s total variable rate indebtedness as a percentage of total indebtedness were below these percentages 
if management adjusts the company s stated goal in the future  the company could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service that could adversely affect funds from operations  adversely affect the company s ability to make expected distributions to its shareholders and the operating partnership s ability to make expected distributions to its limited partners and result in an increased risk of default on the obligations of the company and the operating partnership 
in addition  the company s ability to incur debt is limited by covenants in bank and other credit agreements and in the company s outstanding senior unsecured notes 
the company manages its debt to be in compliance with its stated policy and with its debt covenants  but the company may increase the amount of outstanding debt at any time without a concurrent improvement in the company s ability to service the additional debt 
accordingly  the company could become more leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default of its debt covenants or on its debt obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements 
any covenant breach or significant increase in the company s leverage could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and ability to access debt and equity capital markets in the future 
a downgrade in the credit rating of the company s securities could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
the company s senior unsecured debt is rated investment grade by standard poor s corporation and moody s investors service 
in determining the company s credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of both quantitative and qualitative factors 
these factors include earnings  fixed charges such as interest  cash flows  total debt outstanding  total secured debt  off balance sheet obligations and other commitments  total capitalization and various ratios calculated from these factors 
the rating agencies also consider predictability of cash flows  business strategy and diversity  property development risks  industry conditions and contingencies 
therefore  deterioration in the company s operating performance could also cause the company s investment grade rating to come under pressure 
standard poor s ratings service corporate credit rating on the company is bbb with a stable outlook 
the company s corporate credit rating at moody s investor service is currently baa with a stable outlook 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its credit ratings or that the company s credit ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn in their entirety 
a negative change in the company s ratings outlook or any downgrade in the company s current investment grade credit ratings by the company s rating agencies could adversely affect the company s cost and or access to sources of liquidity and capital 
additionally  a downgrade could  among other things  significantly increase the costs of borrowing under the company s unsecured credit lines and bank term loan  adversely impact the company s ability to obtain unsecured debt or refinance its unsecured credit facilities on competitive terms in the future  or require the company to take certain actions to support its obligations  any of which would adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
if the company or its subsidiaries defaults on an obligation to repay outstanding indebtedness when due  the default could trigger a cross default or cross acceleration under other indebtedness 
if the company or one of its subsidiaries defaults on its obligations to repay outstanding indebtedness  the default could cause a cross default or cross acceleration under other indebtedness and off balance sheet derivative obligations 
a default under the agreements governing the company s or its subsidiaries indebtedness  including a default under post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements mortgage indebtedness  revolving lines of credit  bank term loan  or the indenture for the company s outstanding senior notes  that is not waived by the required lenders or holders of outstanding notes  could trigger cross default or cross acceleration provisions under one or more agreements governing the company s indebtedness and off balance sheet derivative obligations  which could cause an immediate default or allow the lenders or counterparties to declare all funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable 
covenants of the company s or its subsidiaries mortgage indebtedness place restrictions on the company  which reduce operational flexibility and create default risks 
mortgages on the company s or its subsidiaries properties may contain customary negative covenants that  among other things  limit the property owner s ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage 
if the company or its subsidiaries were to breach any debt covenants and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period  its lenders could require the company to repay the debt immediately  and  if the debt is secured  could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure debt  and the company is unable to meet the mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
debt financing may not be available and equity issuances could be dilutive to the company s shareholders 
the company s ability to execute its business strategy depends on its access to an appropriate blend of debt financing  including unsecured lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt  and equity financing  including common and preferred equity 
debt financing may not be available in sufficient amounts  or on favorable terms or at all 
uncertainty in the credit markets may negatively impact the company s ability to borrow and refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates or at all 
in addition  if the company issues additional equity securities through its at the market offering program or in one or more registered offerings to finance developments and acquisitions instead of incurring debt  the interests of existing shareholders could be diluted 
the company may not be able to maintain its current dividend level 
the company pays regular quarterly dividends to holders of shares of its common stock 
commencing with the dividend paid in july  the company established a quarterly dividend payment rate to common shareholders of per share  previously per share 
to the extent the company continues to pay dividends at the current dividend rate  it expects to use cash flows from operations reduced by annual operating capital expenditures to fund the dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders in the company expects to use cash and cash equivalents and  if its net cash flows from operations are not sufficient to meet its anticipated dividend payment rate  line of credit borrowings to fund dividend payments in the company s board of directors reviews the dividend quarterly 
the company s dividends can be paid as a combination of cash and stock in order to satisfy the annual distribution requirements applicable to reits 
to the extent that management considers it advisable to distribute gains from any asset sales to shareholders in the form of a special dividend  the company may pay a portion of such dividend in the form of stock to preserve liquidity 
future dividend payments by the company will be paid at the discretion of the board of directors 
in evaluating whether to pay any dividends and the level and form of such dividends  the company anticipates that the board of directors will consider  among other factors  the following funds from our operations  the company s financial condition and capital requirements in light of the current economic climate and the resulting impact on the company s business  which may persist in  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code  the impact of the payment of any special dividend  including any additional shares issued in connection with a special dividend paid in the form of stock  the impact of any additional shares issued in connection with the company s at the market common equity program  and other factors that the board of directors deems relevant

units in the company s the four seasons private residences luxury condominium project in austin  texas  the austin condominium project  and the ritz carlton residences  atlanta  buckhead luxury condominium project  the atlanta condominium project  became available in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
as of february   units had closed  three units were under contract and units remained available for sale at the austin condominium project and units had closed  units were under contract and units remained available for sale at the atlanta condominium project 
the company s ability to successfully sell remaining for sale housing in its portfolio and achieve management s economic goals in connection with such sales is subject to various risks and challenges  which if they materialize  may have an adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in general  profits realized to date from the company s sale of condominium homes have been more volatile than the company s core apartment rental operations 
in recent years  there has been weakness in the condominium and single family housing markets due to elevated supplies of such assets  weak consumer confidence  tighter credit standards for home purchases  which the company believes has negatively impacted the ability of prospective condominium buyers to qualify for mortgage financing  and general weakness in the residential housing market in the us further  the instability in the global capital markets and a significant decline in economic growth in the us economy in and resulted in a decline in demand in the for sale housing markets 
in recent years  pressure on demand  fueled by tighter credit standards for home buyers  led to an oversupply of new for sale housing that affected the price at which the company is able to sell condominium homes 
in addition  if the company is unable to sell condominium units  the expenses and carrying costs associated with the ownership of such units continue which could cause the company to realize losses in future periods 
in an effort to reduce its unsold inventory  the company implemented reduced pricing programs in prior years which resulted in lower condominium profits 
as a result of these factors  the moderate pace of condominium closings continued in the company cannot predict how long demand and other factors in the real estate market will remain at current levels  but if the markets continue to be weak or deteriorate further  the moderate pace of condominium sales and closings will remain during there can be no assurance of the amount or pace of future for sale condominium sales and closings 
to the extent that condominium pricing pressure continues or worsens or the company is required to hold unsold units longer than anticipated requiring the company to continue to pay on going carrying costs  the profitability of these projects may be materially adversely affected and it could cause the company to realize impairment losses in future periods 
the company s real estate assets may be subject to impairment charges 
the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets under generally accepted accounting principles 
factors considered in evaluating impairment of the company s existing multi family real estate assets held for investment include significant declines in property operating profits  recurring property operating losses and other significant adverse changes in general market conditions that are considered permanent in nature 
generally  a multi family real estate asset held for investment is not considered impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset over its estimated holding period are in excess of the asset s net book value at the balance sheet date 
assumptions used to estimate annual and residual cash flow and the estimated holding period of such assets require the judgment of management 
in addition  for sale condominium assets are evaluated for impairment using the methodology for assets held for sale using discounted projected future cash flows  as construction of these assets is complete and units are ready for their intended use 
thus  should the company s estimates of discounted future cash flows from completed condominium assets be deemed insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets in future periods  the company may be required to recognize future impairment losses on those assets in such periods 
the company recorded aggregate impairment charges of  in to write down the carrying value of its investment in the austin condominium project 
the company also recorded non cash impairment charges of in associated with a land parcel in tampa  florida 
additionally  the company recorded aggregate impairment charges of  in and to write down the carrying value of its investment in the atlanta condominium project and a parcel of adjacent land

table of contents 
index to financial statements there can be no assurance that the company will not take additional charges in the future related to the impairment of the company s assets 
the company s management believes it has applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets 
however  these estimates require the use of estimated market values  which are currently difficult to assess 
should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of its assets  the company could be required to record additional impairment charges 
any future impairment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and funds from operations in the period in which the charge is taken 
increased competition and increased affordability of residential homes could limit the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents 
the company s apartment communities compete with numerous housing alternatives in attracting residents  including other apartment communities and single family rental homes  as well as owner occupied single and multi family homes 
competitive housing in a particular area and the increasing affordability of owner occupied single and multi family homes caused by declining housing prices  mortgage interest rates and government programs to promote home ownership could adversely affect the company s ability to retain its residents  lease apartment homes and increase or maintain rents 
limited investment opportunities could adversely affect the company s growth 
the company expects that other real estate investors will compete to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties 
these competitors include insurance companies  pension and investment funds  developer partnerships  investment companies and other multi family reits 
this competition could increase prices for properties of the type that the company would likely pursue  and competitors may have greater resources than the company 
as a result  the company may not be able to make attractive investments on favorable terms  which could adversely affect its growth 
the company could be negatively impacted by the condition of fannie mae or freddie mac and by changes in government support for multi family housing 
fannie mae and freddie mac are a major source of financing for multi family real estate in the united states 
the company utilizes loan programs sponsored by these entities as a key source of capital to finance its growth and its operations 
in september  the us government assumed control of fannie mae and freddie mac and placed both companies into a government conservatorship under the federal housing finance agency 
in december  the us treasury increased its financial support for these conservatorships 
in february  the obama administration released its blueprint for winding down fannie mae and freddie mac and for reforming the system of housing finance 
since that time  members of congress have introduced and congressional committees have considered a substantial number of bills that include comprehensive or incremental approaches to winding down fannie mae and freddie mac or changing their purposes  businesses  or operations 
a decision by the us government to eliminate or downscale fannie mae or freddie mac or to reduce government support for multi family housing more generally may adversely affect interest rates  capital availability  development of multi family communities and the value of multi family residential real estate and  as a result  may adversely affect the company and its growth and operations 
changing interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of the company s securities 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  debt bearing interest at rates that vary with market interest rates 
therefore  if interest rates increase  the company s interest costs will rise to the extent its variable rate debt is not hedged effectively 
further  while the company s stated goal is to limit variable rate debt to not more than of total indebtedness  management may adjust these levels over time 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of the company s securities to demand a higher annual yield  which could adversely affect the market price of the company s common and preferred stock and debt securities 
interest rate hedging contracts may be ineffective and may result in material charges 
from time to time when the company anticipates issuing debt securities  it may seek to limit exposure to fluctuations in interest rates during the period prior to the pricing of the securities by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
the company may do this to increase the predictability of its financing costs 
also  from time to time  the company may rely on interest rate hedging contracts to limit its exposure under variable rate debt to unfavorable changes in market interest rates 
if the pricing of new debt securities is not within the parameters of  or market interest rates produce a lower interest cost than the company incurs under  a particular interest rate hedging contract  the contract may be ineffective 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements furthermore  the settlement of interest rate hedging contracts has at times involved and may in the future involve material charges 
these charges are typically related to the extent and timing of fluctuations in interest rates 
despite the company s efforts to minimize its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company may not maintain coverage for all of its outstanding indebtedness at any particular time 
if the company does not effectively protect itself from this risk  it may be subject to increased interest costs resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
acquired apartment communities may not achieve anticipated results 
the company may selectively acquire apartment communities that meet its investment criteria 
the company s acquisition activities and their success may be exposed to the following risks an acquired community may fail to achieve expected occupancy and rental rates and may fail to perform as expected  the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired properties and operations  and the company s estimates of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping the acquired property may prove inaccurate  causing the company to fail to meet its profitability goals 
failure to succeed in new markets may limit the company s growth 
the company may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of its existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise 
the company s historical experience in its existing markets does not ensure that it will be able to operate successfully in new markets 
the company may be exposed to a variety of risks if it chooses to enter new markets 
these risks include  among others an inability to evaluate accurately local apartment market conditions and local economies  an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities  an inability to hire and retain key personnel  and lack of familiarity with local governmental and permitting procedures 
compliance or failure to comply with laws requiring access to the company s properties by persons with disabilities could result in substantial cost 
the company s multi family housing communities and any newly acquired multi family housing communities must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations and or commercial facilities as defined by the ada 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in certain public areas of the company s multi family housing communities where such removal is readily achievable 
the ada does not  however  consider residential properties  such as multi family housing communities to be public accommodations or commercial facilities  except to the extent portions of such facilities  such as the leasing office  are open to the public 
the company must also comply with the fair housing act  or the fha  which requires that multi family housing communities first occupied after march  be accessible to persons of disabilities 
noncompliance with the fha and ada could result in the imposition of fines  awards of damages to private litigants  payment of attorneys fees and other costs to plaintiffs  substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation 
compliance with the fha could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access in a community  including the interiors of apartment units covered under the fha 
in addition to the ada and fha  state and local laws exist that impact the company s multi family housing communities with respect to access thereto by persons with disabilities 
further  legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose additional burdens or restrictions on the company with respect to improved access by persons with disabilities 
the ada  fha  or other existing or new legislation may require the company to modify its existing properties 
these laws may also restrict renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings or may require the company to add other structural features that increase its construction costs 
within the past few years  there has been heightened scrutiny of the multi family housing industry for compliance with the requirements of the fha and ada 
in september  the united states department of justice the doj filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the northern district of georgia 
the suit alleges various violations of the fair housing act fha and the americans with disabilities act ada at properties designed  constructed or operated by the company in the district of columbia  virginia  florida  georgia  new york  north carolina and texas 
the plaintiff seeks statutory damages and a civil penalty in unspecified amounts  as well as post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements injunctive relief that includes retrofitting apartments and public use areas to comply with the fha and the ada and prohibiting construction or sale of noncompliant units or complexes 
the company filed a motion to transfer the case to the united states district court for the district of columbia  where a previous civil case involving alleged violations of the fha and ada by the company was filed and ultimately dismissed 
on october   the united states district court for the northern district of georgia issued an opinion finding that the complaint shows that the doj s claims are essentially the same as the previous civil case  and  therefore  granted the company s motion and transferred the doj s case to the united states district court for the district of columbia 
limited discovery is proceeding 
under the court s scheduling order  the deadline for completion of discovery is november and briefing of any dispositive motions would be accomplished by march due to the preliminary nature of the litigation  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of the legal proceeding  nor is it possible to estimate the amount of loss  if any  that would be associated with an adverse decision 
the company cannot ascertain the ultimate cost of compliance with the ada  fha or other similar state and local legislation and such costs are not likely covered by insurance policies 
the cost associated with ongoing litigation or compliance could be substantial and could adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in connection with certain property dispositions or formations of strategic joint ventures  the company may be required to provide indemnification against liabilities associated with the litigation 
losses from natural catastrophes may exceed insurance coverage 
the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  flood  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on its properties  which are believed to be of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets 
the company intends to obtain similar coverage for properties acquired or developed in the future 
however  some losses  generally of a catastrophic nature  such as losses from floods or wind storms  may be subject to limitations 
the company exercises discretion in determining amounts  coverage limits and deductibility provisions of insurance  with a view to maintaining appropriate insurance on its investments at a reasonable cost and on suitable terms  however  the company may not be able to maintain its insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect it against potential losses 
further  the company s insurance costs could increase in future periods 
if the company suffers a substantial loss  its insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement value of the lost investment 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
potential liability for environmental contamination could result in substantial costs 
the company is in the business of owning  operating  developing  acquiring and  from time to time  selling real estate 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  as a current or former owner or operator  the company could be required to investigate and remediate the effects of contamination of currently or formerly owned real estate by hazardous or toxic substances  often regardless of its knowledge of or responsibility for the contamination and solely by virtue of its current or former ownership or operation of the real estate 
in addition  the company could be held liable to a governmental authority or to third parties for property and other damages and for investigation and clean up costs incurred in connection with the contamination 
these costs could be substantial  and in many cases environmental laws create liens in favor of governmental authorities to secure their payment 
the presence of such substances or a failure to properly remediate any resulting contamination could materially and adversely affect the company s ability to borrow against  sell or rent an affected property 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there have been a number of lawsuits in the company s industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
mold growth may be attributed to the use of exterior insulation finishing systems 
the company has implemented guidelines and procedures to address moisture infiltration and resulting mold issues if and when they arise 
the terms of the company s property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against the company  it would be required to use its funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
the company makes no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future adverse impact on its business  results of operations and financial condition 
post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit the company s ability to control such properties and partial interests 
instead of purchasing certain apartment communities directly  the company has invested and may continue to invest as a co venturer 
the company has also chosen to sell partial interests in certain apartment communities to co venturers and may continue this strategy in the future 
joint venturers often have shared control over the operations of the joint venture assets 
therefore  it is possible that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with the company s business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to the company s instructions  requests  policies or objectives 
consequently  a co venturer s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although the company seeks to maintain sufficient influence of any joint venture to achieve its objectives  the company may be unable to take action without the company s joint venture partners approval  or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without the company s consent 
additionally  should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  the company could become liable for such partner s share of joint venture liabilities 
the company may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire 
when the company s residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration  the company may not be able to relet their units 
even if the residents do renew or the company can relet the units  the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms 
because the majority of the company s leases are for apartments  they are generally for no more than one year 
if the company is unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  then the company s results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
consequently  the company s cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders would be reduced 
the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes depends upon its ability to meet on a continuing basis  through actual annual operating results  distribution levels and diversity of stock ownership  the various qualification tests and organizational requirements imposed upon reits under the code 
the company believes that it has qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year ended december   and plans to continue to meet the requirements to qualify as a reit in the future 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
therefore  the company may not have qualified or may not continue to qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that the company qualifies as a reit for federal income tax purposes requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within the company s control 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize the company s reit status 
furthermore  congress and the internal revenue service irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new decisions that make it more difficult  or impossible  for the company to remain qualified as a reit 
the company does not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize its reit status 
if the company were to fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and certain relief provisions of the internal revenue code did not apply  the company would be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates  leaving less money available for distributions to its shareholders 
in addition  distributions to shareholders in any year in which the company failed to qualify would not be deductible by the company for federal income tax purposes nor would they be required to be made 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  the company also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which it ceased to qualify as a reit 
it is not possible to predict whether in all circumstances the company would be entitled to such statutory relief 
the company s failure to qualify as a reit likely would have a significant adverse effect on the value of its securities 
the operating partnership may fail to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
management believes that the operating partnership qualifies  and has so qualified since its formation  as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and not as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation 
no assurance can be provided  however  that the irs will not challenge the treatment of the operating partnership as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or that a court would not sustain such a challenge 
if the irs were successful in treating the operating partnership as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  then the taxable income of the operating partnership would be taxable at regular corporate income tax rates 
in addition  the treatment of the operating partnership post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

see the company may fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes above 
the company s shareholders may not be able to effect a change of control 
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the company and the partnership agreement of the operating partnership contain a number of provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change of control that might involve a premium price for the company s shareholders or otherwise be in their best interests  including the following preferred shares 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that the company has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which were outstanding as of december  the board of directors has the authority  without the approval of the shareholders  to issue additional shares of preferred stock and to establish the preferences and rights of such shares 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of the company  even if a change of control were in the shareholders interest 
consent rights of the unitholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the company may not merge or consolidate with another entity unless the merger includes the merger of the operating partnership  which requires the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding units of the operating partnership 
if the company were to ever hold less than a majority of the units  this voting requirement might limit the possibility for an acquisition or a change of control 
ownership limit 
one of the requirements for maintenance of the company s qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes is that no more than in value of its outstanding capital stock may be owned by five or fewer individuals  including entities specified in the internal revenue code  during the last half of any taxable year 
to facilitate maintenance of its qualification as a reit for federal income tax purposes  the ownership limit under the company s articles of incorporation prohibits ownership  directly or by virtue of the attribution provisions of the internal revenue code  by any person or persons acting as a group of more than of the issued and outstanding shares of the company s common stock  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception for shares of common stock held by the company s former chairman and former vice chairman and certain investors for which the company has waived the ownership limit 
together  these limitations are referred to as the ownership limit 
further  the company s articles of incorporation include provisions allowing it to stop transfers of its shares and to redeem its shares that are intended to assist the company in complying with these requirements 
the company may experience increased costs arising from health care reform 
in march  the united states government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which  among other things  includes guaranteed coverage requirements  eliminates pre existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits  restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits 
the legislation imposes implementation effective dates extending through  and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations 
therefore  due to the phased in nature of the implementation and the lack of interpretive guidance  in some cases  it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on the company s financial results 
possible adverse effects of the health reform legislation include increased costs  exposure to expanded liability and requirements for the company to revise ways in which it provides healthcare and other benefits to its employees 
in addition  the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
a breach of the company s privacy or information security systems could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
privacy and information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks 
as a result  privacy and information security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect the company s systems  computers  software  data and networks from attack  damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for the company 
the company s business requires it to use and store customer and employee personal identifying information 
this may include names  addresses  phone numbers  email addresses  contact preferences  tax identification numbers  and payment account information 
the collection and use of personal identifying information is governed by federal and state laws and post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements regulations 
privacy and information security laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another 
compliance with all such laws and regulations may increase the company s operating costs and adversely impact the company s ability to market the company s properties and services 
the company devotes significant resources to network security to protect the company s systems and data 
the company s security measures include user names and passwords to access company information technology systems 
the company also uses encryption and authentication technologies to secure the transmission and storage of data 
these security measures  however  cannot provide absolute security 
they may be compromised as a result of third party security breaches  employee error  malfeasance  faulty password management  or other irregularity  and result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to company data or accounts 
as cyber threats continue to evolve  the company may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance the company s information security measures and or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 
regardless  the company may experience a breach of the company s systems and may be unable to protect sensitive data 
moreover  if a computer security breach affects the company s systems or results in the unauthorized release of personal identifying information  the company s reputation and brand could be materially damaged and materially adversely affect the company s business 
the company also may be exposed to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability  which could result in a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition

the company  through its wholly owned subsidiaries is the general partner and owns a majority interest in the operating partnership which  through its subsidiaries  conducts substantially all of the on going operations of the company 
at december   the company had interests in  apartment units in communities  including  apartment units in four communities held in unconsolidated entities and  apartment units at seven communities currently under development or in lease up 
the company is also selling luxury for sale condominium homes in two communities through a taxable reit subsidiary 
at december   approximately   and on a unit basis of the company s operating communities were located in the atlanta  georgia  dallas  texas  the greater washington  dc and tampa  florida metropolitan areas  respectively 
the company has elected to qualify and operate as a self administrated and self managed real estate investment trust reit for federal income tax purposes 
a reit is a legal entity which holds real estate interests and is generally not subject to federal income tax on the income it distributes to its shareholders 
at december   the company owned approximately of the common limited partnership interests common units in the operating partnership 
common units held by persons other than the company represented a common minority interest in the operating partnership 
operations overview the following discussion provides an overview of the company s operations  and should be read in conjunction with the more full discussion of the company s operating results  liquidity and capital resources and risk factors reflected elsewhere in this form k 
property operations a gradually improving economy in the united states  favorable demographics and a relatively modest new supply of multi family units to date during the recent real estate cycle have contributed to improved apartment fundamentals in the company s markets since as a result  year over year same store revenues and net operating income noi increased by and  respectively  in  as compared to the company s operating results for and its outlook for are more fully discussed in the results of operations and outlook sections below 
the company s outlook for is based on the expectation that economic and employment conditions will continue to gradually improve 
however  there continues to be significant risks and uncertainty in the economy and the unemployment rate continues to be higher than normal 
if the economic recovery was to stall or us economic conditions were to worsen  the company s operating results would be adversely affected 
furthermore  development of new multi family rental units has continued to increase  and over time  the company expects that this will increase the competitive supply of rental units in the markets in which it operates 
acquisition activity in july  the company acquired post south end  a unit apartment community located in charlotte  north carolina for a purchase price of approximately  the community was completed in  and also includes  square feet of retail space

the company currently expects to utilize available cash  available borrowing capacity under its unsecured bank credit facilities  or other indebtedness  as well as net proceeds from on going condominium sales and its at the market common equity sales program to fund future estimated construction expenditures 
in addition  the company may commence development activities at more of its existing land sites over the next year or so 
management believes  however  that the timing of such development starts will depend largely on a continued favorable outlook for multi family apartment rentals  capital market conditions and the us economy 
until such time as additional development activities commence or certain land positions are sold  the company expects that operating results will be adversely impacted by costs of carrying land held for future investment or sale 
there can be no assurance that land held for investment will be developed in the future or at all 
although the company does not believe that any impairment exists at december   should the company change its expectations regarding the timing and projected undiscounted future cash flows expected from land held for future investment  or the estimated fair value of its assets  the company could be required to recognize impairment losses in future periods 
condominium activity the company has two luxury condominium development projects which began closing sales of completed units in the ritz carlton residences  atlanta buckhead the atlanta condominium project  consisting of units  and the four seasons private residences  austin the austin condominium project  consisting of units 
the company does not expect to further engage in the for sale condominium business in future periods  other than with respect to completing the sell out of units at these two projects 
the company s intention over time is to liquidate its investment in these two condominium projects and to redeploy the invested capital back into its core apartment business 
the company s investment in for sale condominium housing exposes the company to additional risks and challenges  including potential future losses or additional impairments  which could have an adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item a  risk factors in this form k for a discussion of these and other company risk factors 
specifically  the condominium market has been adversely impacted in recent years by the overall weakness in the us economy and residential housing markets  and tighter credit markets for home purchasers  which the company believes has negatively impacted the ability of some prospective condominium buyers to qualify for mortgage financing 
these conditions resulted in the company recording impairment charges in and at its two luxury condominium projects as described below 
although certain of the above described condominium market conditions remain  the company has noted that the pace of condominium sales activity has increased moderately during and is expected to persist into as of february   the company had three units under contract and units closed at the austin condominium project and had units under contract and units closed at the atlanta condominium project 
units under contract include all units currently under contract 
however  the company has experienced contract terminations in these and other condominium projects when units become available for delivery and may experience additional terminations in connection with these projects 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that units under contract will actually close

risk of future condominium impairment losses the company recorded impairment losses in prior years related to the austin condominium project and the atlanta condominium project 
the company recorded a  impairment charge in at the austin condominium project and  in the aggregate  recorded  of impairment charges in and at the atlanta condominium project and an adjacent land site 
the company evaluated the fair value of the austin condominium project and the atlanta condominium project as of december   and determined that no additional impairment existed as of that date 
the model assumptions used to determine the fair value of these projects were based on current cash flow projections over the remaining expected sell out periods and using market discount rates  which reflect the current status of sales  sales prices and other market factors at each of the condominium projects 
there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow projections will not change in future periods and that the estimated fair value of the austin condominium project and the atlanta condominium project will not change materially as a consequence  causing the company to possibly record additional impairment charges in future periods

critical accounting policies in the preparation of financial statements and in the determination of company operating performance  the company utilizes certain significant accounting policies and these accounting policies are discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
as the company is in the business of developing  owning and managing apartment communities and selling for sale condominiums  its critical accounting policies relating to cost capitalization  asset impairment evaluation and revenue and profit recognition of for sale condominium activities are subject to significant management estimates and judgments 
for communities under development or rehabilitation  the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes  and certain internal personnel and associated costs directly related to apartment communities under development and construction 
interest capitalized to projects under development or construction can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the level of projects under development or construction and to a lesser extent  changes in the weighted average interest rate used in the calculation 
in  and  the company capitalized interest totaling   and  respectively 
the increase in capitalized interest in primarily relates to its pipeline of seven apartment communities being developed 
the weighted average interest rate used in the calculation of the capitalized interest amounts was  and in  and  respectively and  as a result  was not the primary driver of the changes in interest capitalization discussed above 
in  the company anticipates decreased interest capitalization over levels due to the substantial completion of construction at three of the company s development communities 
the company expects to start additional development communities in  however  the starts are generally expected to occur in the second half of the year 
the average interest rate expected to be used in the interest capitalization calculation in is expected to be somewhat lower than in which will also serve to lower interest capitalization amounts in lower average capitalization rates in result from debt refinancing activities in that lowered the company s effective interest rates on its total indebtedness see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to the predominately fixed rate nature of the company s debt  future increases or decreases in short term interest rates are not expected to have a significant impact on the weighted average interest rate used for interest capitalization purposes 
future increases in short term and long term interest rates over time would cause an increase in the weighted average rate used for capitalization and could cause interest amounts capitalized to increase 
internal personnel and associated costs are capitalized to the projects under development or construction based upon the effort associated with such projects 
the increase in the company s aggregate apartment projects under development has led to increased capitalization of such costs from to in  and  the company capitalized   and  respectively  and expensed   and  respectively  of development personnel and associated costs 
the company expects capitalization of development personnel and associated costs to development projects to be lower in due to lower aggregate developments under construction in  as three development communities had reached substantial completion of construction by the end of  and since new development starts are generally expected to occur in the second half of the company continually evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its real estate assets using the methodology summarized in its accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements 
under current accounting literature  the evaluation of the recoverability of the company s real estate assets requires the judgment of company management in the determination of the future cash flows expected from the assets and the estimated holding period for post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp 
table of contents 
index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share or unit and apartment unit data the assets 
the company uses market capitalization rates to determine the estimated residual value of its real estate assets and  generally  takes a long term view of the holding period of its assets unless specific facts and circumstances warrant shorter holding periods expected sales  departures from certain geographic markets  etc the company considers a real estate asset held for investment as impaired if the undiscounted  estimated future cash flows of the asset both the annual estimated cash flow from future operations and the estimated cash flow from the asset s eventual sale over its expected holding period are less than the asset s net book value 
for real estate assets held for sale  if any  the company recognizes impairment losses if an asset s net book value is in excess of its estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
at december   management believed it had applied reasonable estimates and judgments in determining the proper classification of its real estate assets and determined that no impairment existed 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the company s methodologies for determining the fair value of the company s real estate assets and for a further discussion of impairment charges recorded in should external or internal circumstances change requiring the need to shorten the holding periods or adjust the estimated future cash flows of certain of the company s assets  the company could be required to record impairment charges in the future 
in addition  for sale condominium assets are evaluated for impairment using the methodology for assets held for sale using discounted projected future cash flows 
the company currently owns two luxury condominium assets with a book value of  at december  these projects were substantially completed and began delivering and closing for sale condominium homes in see the operations overview section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment analysis and the charges of  in related to the austin condominium project as well as for a discussion of the impairment analysis and the charges of  and  net of noncontrolling interests of  related to the atlanta condominium project and adjacent land recorded in and  respectively 
as discussed in the operations overview above  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges in connection with these condominium projects in future years if the company s projections of future discounted cash flows were to indicate in a future quarter that the carrying value of the assets is not deemed recoverable 
under asc topic  plant property and equipment real estate sales  the company uses the relative sales value method to allocate costs and recognize profits from condominium sales 
under the relative sales value method  estimates of aggregate project revenues and aggregate project costs are used to determine the allocation of project cost of sales and the resulting profit in each accounting period 
in subsequent periods  project cost of sale allocations and profits are adjusted to reflect changes in the actual and estimated costs and revenues of each project 
unexpected increases or decreases in estimated project revenues and project costs could cause future cost of sale and profit margin amounts recognized in the financial statements to be different than the amounts recognized in prior periods 
as the company continues the sell out of two luxury condominium communities in future periods  changes in estimates of this nature could have a significant impact on reported future results from operations 
results of operations the following discussion of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of operations  the accompanying selected financial data and the community operations segment performance information included below 
the company s revenues and earnings from continuing operations are generated primarily from the operation of its apartment communities 
for purposes of evaluating comparative operating performance  the company categorizes its operating apartment communities based on the period each community reaches stabilized occupancy 
the company generally considers a community to have achieved stabilized occupancy on the earlier to occur of attainment of physical occupancy on the first day of any month or one year after completion of construction 
for the year ended december   the company s portfolio of operating apartment communities  excluding four communities held in unconsolidated entities  consisted of the following communities that were completed and stabilized for all of and same store communities  one community and a portion of two communities in lease up during  and two communities acquired in and there were no apartment communities classified as held for sale in discontinued operations at december  post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

index to financial statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in thousands  except per share or unit and apartment unit data the company has adopted an accounting policy related to communities in the lease up stage whereby substantially all operating expenses including pre opening marketing  and management and leasing personnel expenses are expensed as incurred 
during the lease up phase  the sum of interest expense on completed units and other operating expenses including pre opening marketing  management and leasing personnel expenses will initially exceed rental revenues  resulting in a lease up deficit  which continues until such time as rental revenues exceed such expenses 
the lease up deficits in  and were approximately  and  respectively 
in order to evaluate the operating performance of its communities for the comparative years listed below  the company has presented financial information which summarizes the rental and other revenues  property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization and net operating income on a comparative basis for all of its operating communities and for its stabilized operating communities 
net operating income is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to net operating income 
net operating income is reconciled to gaap net income in the financial information accompanying the tables 
the company believes that net operating income is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a reit s operating real estate because it provides a measure of the core operations  rather than factoring in depreciation and amortization  financing costs and general and administrative expenses 
this measure is particularly useful  in the opinion of the company  in evaluating the performance of geographic operations  operating segment groupings and individual properties 
additionally  the company believes that net operating income  as defined  is a widely accepted measure of comparative operating performance in the real estate investment community 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the operating performance from continuing operations for all of the company s apartment communities summarized by segment for and is summarized as follows year ended december  change rental and other property revenues fully stabilized communities development and lease up communities acquired communities other property segments property operating and maintenance expenses excluding depreciation and amortization fully stabilized communities development and lease up communities acquired communities other property segments  including corporate management expenses property net operating income capital expenditures annually recurring carpet other total periodically recurring average apartment units in service communities which reached stabilization prior to january  communities acquired subsequent to january  post properties  inc post apartment homes  lp

the expense increase from other property segments primarily reflects increased corporate property management expenses of resulting from modest increases in annual salaries and estimated cash incentive plan accruals  small headcount increases in the property services supervisory team in and increased net employee termination costs in additionally  the increase is due to increased employee termination costs at the company s corporate apartment leasing business and modest personnel expense increases in the company s commercial property management business

the condominium gains in include the impact of a income tax benefit resulting from the carryback of net operating losses to recover income taxes paid in prior years 
the increase in condominium gains between periods reflects the impact of increased unit closings  closings in compared to closings in  the impact of improved profit margins at both condominium communities in and lower on going condominium carrying costs 
condominium revenues increased by  between periods primarily due to the impact of increased unit sales discussed above 
profit margins improved primarily as a result of favorable revisions to the estimated timing and amount of estimated project revenues and costs as the sell out process is approximately complete at one community and complete at the second community 
finally  on going carrying costs are lower between periods as the remaining units owned by the company have decreased  resulting in somewhat lower property tax and owners association expenses

however  there continues to be significant risks and uncertainty in the economy and the unemployment rate continues to be higher than normal 
if the economic recovery was to stall or us economic conditions were to worsen  the company s operating results would be adversely affected

the company currently believes that it will continue to have access to additional equity capital  unsecured debt financing and secured debt financing through loan programs sponsored by fannie mae  freddie mac and other secured lenders 
in the past  the company has utilized loan programs sponsored by fannie mae and freddie mac as a key source of capital to finance its growth and its operations 
should these entities discontinue providing liquidity to the company s sector  it could significantly reduce the company s access to debt capital and or increase borrowing costs and could adversely affect the development of multi family homes 
in addition  the amount and timing of any new debt financings may be limited by restrictive covenants under the company s current unsecured debt arrangements  such as coverage ratios and limitations on aggregate secured debt as a percentage of total assets  as defined 
there can be no assurances that such secured financing will continue to be available through us government sponsored programs and other secured lenders or that the company s access to additional debt financings will not be limited by its financial covenants

the substantial majority of these leases are for one year or less and the remaining leases are for up to two years 
at the expiration of a lease term  the company s lease agreements generally provide that the term will be extended unless either the company or the lessee gives at least sixty days written notice of termination 
in addition  the company s policy generally permits the earlier termination of a lease by a lessee upon thirty days written notice to the company and the payment of an amount equal to two month s rent as compensation for early termination 
the short term nature of these leases generally serves to offset the risk to the company that the adverse effect of inflation may have on the company s general  administrative and operating expenses 
funds from operations the company uses the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit definition of funds from operations ffo 
ffo is defined by nareit as net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation of real estate assets  and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures all determined on a consistent basis in accordance with gaap 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure 
ffo presented herein is not necessarily comparable to ffo presented by other real estate companies because not all real estate companies use the same definition 
the company s ffo is comparable to the ffo of real estate companies that use the current nareit definition 
the company also uses ffo as an operating measure 
accounting for real estate assets using historical cost accounting under gaap assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its april white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result  the concept of ffo was created by nareit for the reit industry to provide an alternate measure 
since the company agrees with the concept of ffo and appreciates the reasons surrounding its creation  management believes that ffo is an important supplemental measure of operating performance 
in addition  since most equity reits provide ffo information to the investment community  the company believes ffo is a useful supplemental measure for comparing the company s results to those of other equity reits 
the company believes that the line on the company s consolidated statement of operations entitled net income available to common shareholders is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ffo 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income available to common shareholders determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of the company s financial performance 
while management believes that ffo is an important supplemental non gaap financial measure  management believes it is also important to stress that ffo should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity 
further  ffo is not necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the company s needs or ability to service indebtedness or make distributions
