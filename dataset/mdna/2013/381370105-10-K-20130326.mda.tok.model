overview we are a provider of electrical construction services throughout much of the united states 
for the year ended december   our total consolidated revenue was million  of which was attributable to our electrical construction operations 
through our subsidiary  southeast power corporation southeast power  we are engaged in the construction and maintenance of electric utility facilities for electric utilities and industrial customers  and the installation of fiber optic cable for fiber optic cable manufacturers  telecommunication companies  and electric utilities 
southeast power performs electrical contracting services primarily in the southeastern  mid atlantic and western regions of the united states 
southeast power is headquartered in titusville  florida and has additional offices in bastrop  texas and spartanburg  south carolina 
the electrical construction business is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with other independent contractors  including larger regional and national firms that may have financial  operational  technical and marketing resources that exceed our own 
we also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in house service organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of service as those provided by us 
in addition  a significant portion of our electrical construction revenue is derived from a small group of customers  several of which account for a substantial portion of our revenue in any given year 
the relative revenue contribution by any single customer or group of customers may significantly fluctuate from period to period 
for example  for the years ended december  and  three of our customers accounted for approximately and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
the loss of  or decrease in current demand from one or more of these customers  would  if not replaced by other business  result in a decrease in revenue  margins and profits  which could be material 
historically  we have reported real estate development activities as a separate segment 
in recent years  our real estate activities diminished to a point that they are no longer significant for reporting purposes and  accordingly  results of our ongoing real estate operations are included in the income statement under the caption other 
revenue from real estate development included under the caption other was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of our total revenue for such years 
we completed our last condominium project during and we have sold all of the condominium units as of december  no new condominium projects are presently contemplated and we do not hold any units for sale 
our only current real estate construction activity is the construction of a very limited number of single family residential properties in the area of the company headquarters 

table of contents critical accounting estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts and deferred income tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable  under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the selection and development of our critical accounting policies  estimates  and related disclosure with the audit committee of the board of directors 
percentage of completion we recognize revenue from fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  using primarily the cost to cost method based on the percentage of total cost incurred to date  in proportion to total estimated cost to complete the contract 
total estimated cost  and thus contract income  is impacted by several factors including  but not limited to changes in productivity and scheduling  the cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  site conditions and scheduling that differ from those assumed in the original bid to the extent contract remedies are unavailable  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project  a change in the availability and proximity of materials  and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
the accuracy of our revenue and profit recognition in a given period is almost solely dependent on the accuracy of our estimates of the cost to complete each project 
due to our experience and our detailed approach in determining our cost estimates for all of our significant projects  we believe our estimates to be highly reliable 
however  our projects can be complex and in almost every case the profit margin estimates for a project will either increase or decrease  to some extent  from the amount that was originally estimated at the time of bid 
because we have a number of projects of varying levels of complexity and size in process at any given time  these changes in estimates can offset each other without materially impacting our overall profitability 
if a current estimate of total costs indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
accrued contract losses as of december  and  were and  respectively 
for both the years ended december  and  the accrued contract losses are mainly attributable to transmission projects experiencing either adverse weather conditions or unexpected construction issues 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is probable 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  income taxes  which establishes the recognition requirements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
as of december   our deferred tax assets were largely comprised of alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforwards and retainage payable refer to note to the consolidated financial statement 
the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the deferred tax assets are expected to be recovered or settled 
in the assessment for a valuation allowance  appropriate consideration is given to all positive and negative evidence related to the realization of the deferred tax assets 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with loss carryforwards expiring unused  and tax planning alternatives 
if we determine we will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets beginning in based upon an evaluation of all available evidence at that time 
our cumulative loss position and market conditions over the evaluation period were significant negative evidence in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
however  based on our forecasts of future taxable income and improved earnings in  we anticipate being able to generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our deferred tax assets 
therefore  we reduced the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to zero and this reduction resulted in the recognition of a benefit for federal income taxes during the period ended june  the minimum amount of future taxable income required to be generated to fully realize the deferred tax assets as of december  is approximately million 

table of contents 
table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the table below is our operating income attributable to our electrical construction operations for the two year period ended december as indicated revenue operating expenses cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative depreciation gain loss on sale of assets total operating expenses operating income operating income is total operating revenue less operating expenses inclusive of depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses also include any gains or losses on the sale of property and equipment 
operating income excludes interest expense  interest income  other income  and income taxes 
revenue total revenue for the year ended december   more than doubled to million  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december   due to the increase in electrical construction revenue 
electrical construction operations revenue increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was largely due to an increase in demand for our electrical construction services  primarily our transmission work  which represents approximately of the total increase in electrical construction revenue 
our increase in transmission project revenue includes several large projects throughout texas  florida and the carolinas 
this increase in revenue was attributable to segment wide growth  with the most dramatic increase occurring in texas 
the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in our backlog from time to time 
backlog represents the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under project specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under our existing service agreements  including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services and many of our contracts may be terminated with notice  therefore we do not consider any portion of our backlog to be firm 
however  our customers become obligated once we provide the services they have requested 
our service agreements are typically multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical relationships with these customers 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
backlog increased to approximately million as of december   from million as of december  the backlog as of december  included a balance of million relating to a south texas electric cooperative inc stec contract awarded to southeast power in february as a result of southeast power expansion during of its geographical footprint into texas and establishment of permanent facilities there  southeast power was selected as prime contractor by stec to build a mile long kv transmission line  as part of a competitive renewable energy zones crez wind generation projects 
this project is scheduled to be completed in august the december  electrical construction operational backlog of approximately million included approximately million from fixed price contracts  for which revenue is recognized using percentage of completion  and approximately million from service agreement contracts  for which revenue is recognized as work is performed 
of our total backlog  we expect approximately to be completed during the december  backlog of million included approximately million from fixed price contracts and approximately  from service agreements 
revenue from our other operations for the year ended december   was not significant and was relatively unchanged from the prior year 

table of contents operating results total operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in electrical construction operations operating income increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  operating margins on electrical construction operations increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of an increase in higher margin transmission construction projects 
our other operations had operating income of  for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  for the year ended december   an increase of  this increase was mainly due to the impairment write down to our real estate land property of  during the year ended december  there was no impairment recognized during the year ended december  costs and expenses total costs and expenses  and the components thereof  increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  electrical construction operations cost of goods sold increased by million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase in costs corresponds to the aforementioned year to year increase in revenue 
our other operations costs of goods sold for the year ended december   was not significant and was relatively unchanged from the prior year 
the following table sets forth selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the years ended december as indicated electrical construction operations other corporate total sg a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses was mainly attributable to increases in corporate administrative expenditures  specifically salaries and compensation  during the year ended december   when compared to  mainly attributable to the company expansion 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses were increases in professional services within our electrical construction operations  as well as a slight increase in selling expenses during the year ended december   when compared to as a percentage of revenue  sg a expenses decreased to for  from in  due primarily to the aforementioned increase in revenue during the current year  when compared to the following table sets forth depreciation expense for the years ended december as indicated electrical construction operations other corporate total depreciation expense increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in depreciation is mainly due to the increase in fixed assets purchases for new equipment  primarily for our electrical construction operations  as a result of our growth and expansion efforts 

table of contents income taxes the following table presents our provision for income tax and effective income tax rate from continuing operations for the years ended december as indicated income tax provision effective income tax rate our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
our effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the reversal of the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
our income tax provision for the year ended december   includes only state income tax expense attributable to a subsidiary  and does not reflect the federal statutory rate of  since tax benefits are not recognized when a full valuation allowance is in effect 
the tax relief  unemployment insurance reauthorization and job creation act of allows bonus depreciation for tax purposes  which upon application resulted in a taxable loss in discontinued operations we were previously engaged in mining activities and ended all such activities in december for the year ended december   there were no results or activity related to these discontinued operations 
all results of these discontinued operations for the year ended december   were related to settlement agreements with the united states environmental protection agency the epa 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these matters 
liquidity and capital resources working capital analysis our primary cash needs have been for capital expenditures and working capital 
our primary sources of cash have been cash flow from operations and borrowings under our lines of credit and equipment financing 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  as compared to cash and cash equivalents of million  and working capital of million as of december  in addition  we had million in an unused revolving line of credit as of december  this revolving line of credit is used as a working capital loan the working capital loan  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that this cash on hand  our credit facilities and our future cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our operating needs and debt requirements for the next twelve months 
cash flow analysis the following table presents our net cash flows for each of the years ended december as indicated net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities cash flows from operating activities are comprised of the net income  adjusted to reflect the timing of cash receipts and disbursements therefrom 
our cash flows are influenced by the level of operations  operating margins and the types of services we provide  as well as the stages of our electrical construction projects 
cash provided by our operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the increase in cash flows from operating activities is primarily due to the changes in our net income and our deferred taxes during the current year 
net income increased to million from  when comparing the year ended december   to the same period in  mainly attributable to the increase in our revenue  due to the increase in demand for our electrical construction services 
also contributing to the increase in the changes to cash provided by our operating activities are changes in our deferred taxes  which totaled an increase of million for the year ended december   from zero in the prior year 
the change in our deferred taxes is mainly attributable to the increase in our deferred tax liability  due to the election of bonus depreciation for the year ended december  these increases in the changes to cash provided by operating activities were offset by the changes in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the changes reflected in the item costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts changed from  for the year ended december  to million for the year 
table of contents ended december   primarily due to costs commensurate with larger contracts 
operating cash flows normally fluctuate relative to the status of our electrical construction projects 
days of sales outstanding analysis we evaluate fluctuations in our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  for our electrical construction operations  by comparing days of sales outstanding dso 
we calculate dso as of the end of any period by utilizing the respective quarter s electrical construction revenue to determine sales per day 
we then divide accounts receivable and accrued billings  net of allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of the period  by sales per day  to calculate dso for accounts receivable 
to calculate dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  we divide costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  by sales per day 
for the quarters ended december  and  our dso for accounts receivable were and  respectively  and our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts were and  respectively 
the decrease in our dso for accounts receivable and accrued billings was mainly due to the aforementioned increase in transmission project revenue primarily for the year ended december   when compared to the increase in our dso for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts was mainly due to the aforementioned increase in costs incurred on uncompleted contracts 
also contributing to the increase were certain customer provisions  which allowed us to invoice uncompleted projects in advance of completion during the fourth quarter in we did not have a significant amount of projects with these provisions during the fourth quarter of as of march   we have received approximately of our december  outstanding trade accounts receivable and have billed of our costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings balance 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   was million  compared to cash used of million for the increase in cash used in our investing activities for the year ended december   when compared to  is primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures  during the current year period 
these capital expenditures are mainly attributable to purchases of equipment  primarily trucks and heavy machinery  used by our electrical construction operations for the upgrading and replacement of equipment  as well as expansion efforts 
our capital budget for is expected to total approximately million  the majority of which is for upgrading and purchases of equipment  for our electrical construction operations 
we plan to fund these purchases through our cash on hand and equipment financing  consistent with past practices 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   was million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for our financing activities for the current year consisted mainly of net borrowings on our equipment loans totaling million  as well as borrowings on our working capital loan of million 
these borrowings were offset by net repayments on our electrical construction equipment loans totaling million  repayments on our working capital loan of million  and installment loan repayments of  our financing activities for the year ended december  consisted mainly of net borrowings on our equipment loan of million  as well as borrowings on our working capital loan of  these borrowings were offset by repayments on notes payable totaling million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding these borrowings 
we have paid no cash dividends on our common stock since  and it is not expected that we will pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future 
debt covenants our debt arrangements contain various financial and other covenants including  but not limited to minimum tangible net worth  outside debt limitation  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio 
other loan covenants prohibit  among other things  incurring additional indebtedness  issuing loans to other entities in excess of a certain amount  entering into a merger or consolidation  and any change in our current chief executive officer without prior written consent from the lender 
the loans also have cross default provisions whereby any default under any loans of the company or its subsidiaries with the lender  will constitute a default under all of the other loans of the company and its subsidiaries with the lender 
the most significant of these covenants are minimum tangible net worth  outside debt limitation  and maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio 
we must maintain a tangible net worth of at least million  no more than  in outside debt with certain exceptions as allowed per addenda dated september  regarding leases  and a maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio of no greater than 
we were in compliance with all of our covenants as of december  
table of contents the following are computations of these most restrictive financial covenants covenant actual as of december  tangible net worth minimum outside debt not to exceed maximum debt worth ratio not to exceed on september   branch  banking and trust company the bank and the company agreed to modify and replace the leases item of the covenants sections of the working capital loan  the million equipment loan agreement between southeast power and the bank  and the million equipment loan agreement between southeast power and the bank 
these modifications allow the company to incur certain leases  which would result in additional debt above the  debt limitation  as described in the addenda to the loan agreements filed in our current report on form k on september  forecast we anticipate our cash on hand  and cash flows from operations and credit facilities  will provide sufficient cash to enable us to meet our working capital needs  debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
the amount of our planned capital expenditures will depend  to some extent  on the results of our future performance 
however  our revenue  results of operations and cash flows  as well as our ability to seek additional financing  may be negatively impacted by factors including  but not limited to a decline in demand for electrical construction services  general economic conditions  heightened competition  availability of construction materials  increased interest rates  and adverse weather conditions 
the transmission projects associated with crez are typically much larger and of greater duration than those usually undertaken by southeast power 
these projects will require greater resources including equipment  bank lines of credit  bonding and personnel than encountered in our typical projects 
the company believes that it will have available adequate resources to complete any work it undertakes 
inflation as a result of relatively low levels of inflation experienced during the years ended december  and  inflation did not have a significant effect on our results
