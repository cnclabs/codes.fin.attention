item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with two business elements plasma kallikrein mediated angioedema portfolio the principal focus of our efforts is to identify  develop and commercialize treatments for angioedemas that are identified as plasma kallikrein mediated  which we refer to as pkm angioedemas  including hereditary angioedema hae and idiopathic angioedema 
we developed kalbitor ecallantide on our own  and since february  we have been selling it in the united states for the treatment of acute attacks of hae 
outside of the united states  we have established partnerships to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize kalbitor in certain markets and we are evaluating opportunities in others 
we are expanding our franchise for the treatment of pkm angioedemas in the following ways development of diagnostic strategies to assist in the differentiation between histamine mediated and pkm angioedema 
continuing our development of dx  a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein  which could be a candidate to prophylactically treat pkm angioedemas 
phage display licensing and funded research program we leverage our proprietary phage display technology through our licensing and funded research program  referred to as the lfrp 
this program has provided us a portfolio of product candidates being developed by our licensees  which currently includes product candidates in various stages of clinical development  including three in phase trials  for which we are eligible to receive future royalties and or milestone payments 
the lfrp generated approximately million of revenue for us in to the extent that our licensees commercialize some of the phase product candidates  our revenues under the lfrp are expected to experience growth beginning in pkm angioedema portfolio we are focused on identifying and developing treatments for patients who experience pkm angioedema 
using our phage display technology  we developed ecallantide  a compound shown in vitro to be a high affinity  high specificity inhibitor of human plasma kallikrein 
plasma kallikrein  an enzyme found in blood  produces bradykinin  a protein that causes blood vessels to enlarge or dilate  which can cause swelling known as angioedema 
plasma kallikrein is believed to be a key component in the regulation of inflammation and contact activation pathways 
excess plasma kallikrein activity is thought to play a role in a number of inflammatory diseases  including pkm angioedemas such as hae and idiopathic angioedema 
we have three key areas of activity in our pkm angioedema portfolio hae and kalbitor 
in february  we began selling kalbitor in the united states for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we are selling kalbitor on our own in the united states 
working with international partners  we intend to seek approval for and commercialize kalbitor for hae and other angioedema indications in markets outside of the united states 
we have entered into agreements for others to develop and commercialize subcutaneous ecallantide for the treatment of hae and other angioedema indications throughout europe  japan  china and countries in latin america and the middle east 
identification of pkm angioedemas 
in order to expand our pkm angioedema portfolio  we have launched a program to identify one or more diagnostic strategies that will assist in the differentiation of pkm angioedema from histamine mediated angioedema  in order to direct appropriate treatment 
we have developed laboratory tests for which the process of clinical validation has commenced 
these tools are expected to be relevant to both normal cesterase inhibitor c inh and c inh deficient patients and will enable the identification of pkm angioedema  including type iii hae and angioedema of unknown origin  or idiopathic angioedema 
dx antibody for pkm angioedemas 
based on our knowledge of angioedema and the kallikrein kinin pathway  we are investigating the use of a fully human monoclonal antibody that is an inhibitor of plasma kallikrein and which could be a candidate to treat prophylactically pkm angioedemas 
after completing a series of pharmacokinetic  tolerability and preclinical studies  we believe dx may be effective for prophylactically treating these indications 
we expect to file an investigational new drug application ind for this antibody in mid licensing and funded research program we believe that our phage display libraries  which we have developed using our core technology and know how  represent a leading technology in antibody discovery 
we leverage our proprietary phage display technology and libraries through our lfrp licenses and collaborations 
to date  we have recognized more than million of revenue under the lfrp  primarily related to license fees and milestones  including approximately million of revenue in the lfrp has the potential for substantially greater revenues  if and when product candidates that are discovered by our licensees receive marketing approval and are commercialized 
lfrp product development currently  product candidates generated by our licensees or collaborators under the lfrp portfolio are in clinical development and one product has received market approval from the fda 
we will receive future milestones and or royalties from our licensees and collaborators for of the product candidates that are currently in clinical development  including three in phase and four in phase trials  to the extent these product candidates advance in development and are ultimately commercialized 
furthermore  our licensees and collaborators have additional product candidates in various stages of preclinical development 
our licensees and collaborators are responsible for all costs associated with development of these product candidates 
to the extent that our licensees commercialize some of the phase product candidates  our revenues under the lfrp are expected to experience growth beginning in under loan arrangements with affiliates of hc royalty  we have obtained debt funding which has a principal balance of million as of december   secured exclusively by the lfrp  which is described more fully in note to notes to consolidated financial statements filed under item of this form k 
results of operations revenues 
total revenues for were million  compared with million in and million in product sales 
we began commercializing kalbitor in the united states in for treatment of acute attacks of hae in patients years of age and older 
we sell kalbitor to our distributors  and we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have passed to the distributor  typically upon delivery 
due to the specialty nature of kalbitor  the limited number of patients  limited return rights and contractual limits on inventory levels  we anticipate that distributors will carry inventory that is in line with ordinary business needs 
although fluctuations can occur due to the acute nature of hae attacks  generally distributors do not hold inventory of more than days of anticipated demand 
we record product sales net of allowances and accruals related to trade prompt pay discounts  government rebates  a patient financial assistance program  product returns and other applicable allowances 
in  product sales of kalbitor increased to million  net of product discounts and allowances of million  compared to product sales of million  net of product discounts and allowances of million during and product sales of million  net of product discounts and allowances of  during the and increases in product sales were primarily due to a significant increase in the volume of kalbitor units sold  as well as a price increase in each of those years 
provisions for product sales allowances reduced gross product sales as follows in thousands total gross product sales prompt pay and other discounts government rebates and chargebacks returns product sales allowances total product sales  net total product sales allowances as a percent of gross product sales development and license fees 
we also derive revenues from licensing  funded research and development fees  including milestone payments from our licensees and collaborators  in amounts that fluctuate from year to year due to the timing of the licensing and clinical activities of our collaborators and licensees 
this revenue was million in  million in and million in development and license fee revenue in included million recognized under our agreement  as amended  with sigma tau  compared with  and million recognized in and  respectively see note  significant transactions sigma tau 
development and license fee revenue in included the recognition of million from the sale of rights to royalties and other payments related to xyntha  a product developed by one of our licensees under the lfrp  and million of previously deferred revenue associated with the cubist license that was fully recognized during based upon cubist termination of its ecallantide development program 
cost of product sales 
we incurred million of costs associated with product sales during  million during and  during this primarily includes the cost of testing  filling  packaging and distributing the kalbitor product  as well as a royalty due on net sales of kalbitor 
costs associated with the manufacture of kalbitor prior to fda approval were previously expensed when incurred and  accordingly  were not included in the cost of product sales during  and the supply of kalbitor produced prior to fda approval met commercial needs through the third quarter of when this supply was depleted during the fourth quarter of  our cost of product sales increased  reflecting more of the cost of manufacturing kalbitor product 
during  we expect the cost of product sales to reflect the full cost of kalbitor manufacturing 
research and development 
our research and development expenses are summarized as follows years ended december  in thousands kalbitor development costs other research and development expenses lfrp pass through fees total our research and development expenses arise primarily from compensation and other related costs for our personnel dedicated to research  development  medical and pharmacovigilence activities  costs of post approval studies and commitments and kalbitor life cycle management  as well as fees paid and costs reimbursed to outside parties to conduct research and clinical trials 
kalbitor development costs decreased in compared to primarily due to the discontinuation during june of the clinical study of the use of ecallantide for the treatment of ace inhibitor induced angioedema 
this phase clinical study was initiated during and the increase in costs over was primarily due to this study 
in addition  costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for the treatment of hae in territories outside the united states were  million and million during  and  respectively 
these amounts were reimbursed by sigma tau and such payments are recorded as development and license fee revenue in our results of operations 
the increase in other research and development costs from was due primarily to the pre clinical  scale up activities for dx  a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein  which could be a candidate to treat prophylactically pkm angioedemas 
the decrease in other research and development costs from was due to a shift in internal efforts from early stage development programs to kalbitor development 
research and development expenses may increase in future years  due to costs associated with our clinical study developing dx as a therapeutic candidate 
until the clinical studies are further advanced  we are not able to predict the future clinical costs that may be incurred for the development of this candidate 
selling  general and administrative 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the sales and marketing costs of commercializing kalbitor  costs of our management and administrative staff  as well as expenses related to business development  protecting our intellectual property  administrative occupancy  professional fees and the reporting requirements of a public company 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the and increases in costs are primarily due to the expansion of infrastructure to support kalbitor commercial efforts  primarily sales and marketing programs  and additional legal expenses to protect our intellectual property 
we do not anticipate a significant change in the trend for selling  general and administrative expenses in restructuring 
in february  we implemented a realignment of our business which included a workforce reduction 
as a result  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million 
interest expense 
interest expense  which is primarily derived from our loan arrangement with hc royalty  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
based on the modification of the hc royalty loan in december  under which we received additional proceeds of million  we recorded interest expense in using the effective interest rate method for the different tranches of the loans 
the effective interest rate is now approximately 
in and  we recorded interest expense at the stated interest rate for each tranche  which in total was approximately 
the higher expense was also due to additional interest expense under the hc royalty loan of approximately million for payments in connection with the sale of our rights to royalties and other payments related to the xyntha product 
interest and other income 
interest income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower cash and investment balances during the year 
in  income of million was recognized from several grants received under the qualifying therapeutic discovery project program 
under this program  the internal revenue service  in conjunction with the department of health and human services  approved our applications for projects that showed significant potential to produce new and cost saving therapies  support jobs and increase us competitiveness 
all proceeds from this grant were classified as other income in the statement of operations 
net loss 
for the year ended december   the net loss was million or per share  as compared to million or per share in  and million or per share in liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments the following table summarizes our cash flow activity years ended december  in thousands net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents we require cash to fund our operating activities  make capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments  and service debt 
through december   we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities  which have provided aggregate net cash proceeds since inception of approximately million  and from borrowed funds under our loan agreement with hc royalty  which are secured by certain assets associated with our lfrp 
in addition  we generate funds from product sales and development and license fees 
our excess funds are currently invested in short term investments primarily consisting of united states treasury notes and bills and money market funds backed by the united states treasury 
operating activities 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had cash outflows due to changes in other operating assets and liabilities  including an increase in inventory of million  an increase in prepaid and other assets of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  primarily associated with revenue recognized for lfrp licenses that was previously deferred 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had cash outflows due to changes in other operating assets and liabilities  including an increase in inventory of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in deferred revenue of million  due primarily to the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to our collaborations to commercialize ecallantide outside of the united states 
in  the principal use of cash in our operations was to fund our million net loss 
of this net loss  certain costs were non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization costs of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
in addition to non cash charges  we also had a net change in other operating assets and liabilities of million  including a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  and a decrease in deferred revenue of million 
the change in deferred revenue is primarily due to the recognition of million of revenue associated with the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with cubist  offset by additional deferred revenue of million from new collaborations to commercialize ecallantide outside the united states 
investing activities 
our investing activities for primarily consisted of million of investments which matured  offset by the purchase of million of investments  as well as a decrease of million in restricted cash resulting from the release of the letter of credit that had been issued as a security deposit under the lease of our previous facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
these are offset by the purchase of million of fixed assets primarily made up of leasehold improvements for the new burlington facility  of which million was covered by a tenant improvement allowance and million was financed through an equipment loan arrangement 
our investing activities for consisted of approximately million of investment maturities  offset by the purchase of million of investments 
in addition  during  we expended approximately million in leasehold improvements related to the build out of the new burlington facility  of which  was reimbursed by the landlord in the residual balance was reimbursed by the landlord during  as referenced above 
in conjunction with the burlington lease agreement  we have provided the landlord a letter of credit of million to secure our obligations under the lease 
our investing activities for consisted of the purchase of approximately million of investments  offset by million of investment maturities  as well as a decrease of  in restricted cash from the contractual reduction of the letter of credit that serves as our security deposit for the lease of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
financing activities 
our financing activities for consisted million from the issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and the employee stock option plan  a drawdown of million under an equipment loan arrangement  as well as the repayment of long term debt totaling  primarily to hc royalty 
see below for more details on our loan with hc royalty 
our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million of new debt from an affiliate of hc royalty  as well as principal repayments of long term debt totaling million  consisting of capital lease payments and million to hc royalty 
our financing activities for consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of our common stock  as well as principal repayments of long term debt totaling million  consisting of capital lease payments and million to hc royalty 
we expect to continue to manage our cash requirements by completing additional partnerships  collaborations  and financial and strategic transactions 
we expect that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments together with anticipated cash flow from existing development  collaborations and license agreements and product sales of kalbitor will be sufficient to support our current operations into we will need additional funds if our cash requirements exceed our current expectations or if we generate less revenue than we expect during this period 
we may seek additional funding through our collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
we may not be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or at all  and we may not be able to enter into additional collaborative arrangements 
arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
if we need additional funds and are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we would curtail significantly our research  development or commercialization programs in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations  which could adversely affect our business prospects 
healthcare royalty partners in august  we completed an agreement that we entered into with an affiliate of hc royalty in december to refinance our existing loans with hc royalty 
at december   the aggregate principal amount of the new loan was million  consisting of a million tranche a loan and a million tranche b loan 
the loans bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable quarterly 
the loans will mature in august  and can be repaid without penalty beginning in august in connection with the loans  we entered into a security agreement granting hc royalty a security interest in the intellectual property related to the lfrp  and the revenues generated through our licenses of the intellectual property related to the lfrp 
the security agreement does not apply to our internal drug development or to any of our co development programs for hae 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we are required to repay the loans based on the annual net lfrp receipts 
until september   required payments are equal to the sum of of the first million in specified annual lfrp receipts and of specified annual lfrp receipts over million 
after september   and until the maturity date or the complete repayment of the loans  hc royalty will receive of all specified lfrp receipts 
if the hc royalty portion of lfrp receipts for any quarter exceeds the interest for that quarter  then the principal balance will be reduced 
any unpaid principal will be due upon the maturity of the loans 
if the hc royalty portion of lfrp revenues for any quarterly period is insufficient to cover the cash interest due for that period  the deficiency may be added to the outstanding principal or paid in cash 
in december and august  five years from the issuance dates of the tranche a and tranche b loans  we must repay all additional accumulated principal above the original loan amounts of million and million  respectively 
tranche a loan in december  we entered into an agreement with an affiliate of hc royalty and received a loan of million tranche a loan and a commitment to refinance the amounts outstanding under our march amended and restated loan agreement the march loan agreement at a reduced interest rate in august the tranche a loan was unsecured and accrued interest at an annual rate of through august  at which time the tranche a loan and its accrued interest was combined with of the unpaid principal and accrued interest outstanding under the march loan agreement upon the closing of the tranche b loan 
upon execution of the tranche a loan  the terms of the original loans defined below were determined to be modified under asc accordingly  during the year ended december   interest expense on the loan is being recorded in the company s financial statements at an effective interest rate of 
upon modification of the debt arrangement  the note payable balance related to the tranche a loan was reduced by  to reflect payment of legal fees in conjunction with the loan  these fees are being accreted over the life of the loan  through august tranche b loan in and  we entered into loan agreements with an affiliate of hc royalty that provided aggregate loan proceeds of million the original loans 
these loans had an outstanding principal and accrued interest balance of million at the time of their refinancing in august tranche b loan 
the original loans bore interest at an annual rate of  payable quarterly  and were secured by the company s lfrp 
in connection with the original loans  the company issued affiliates of hc royalty warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
in august  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant expires in august and became exercisable in august we estimated the relative fair value of the warrant to be  on the date of issuance  using the black scholes valuation model  assuming a volatility factor of  risk free interest rate of  an eight year expected term and an expected dividend yield of zero 
in march  we issued hc royalty a second warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant expires in august and became exercisable in march we estimated the relative fair value of the warrant to be  on the date of issuance  using the black scholes valuation model  assuming a volatility factor of  risk free interest rate of  a seven year  four month expected term and an expected dividend yield of zero 
the relative fair values of the warrants as of the date of issuance are recorded in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheets 
the cash proceeds from the original loans were recorded as a note payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
the note payable balance was reduced by million for the fair value of the warrants issued  and by  for payment of hc royalty s legal fees in conjunction with the tranche b loan 
prior to the december issuance of the tranche a loan  each of these amounts was being accreted over the life of the note through august subsequent to the modification of the debt arrangement in december  the unamortized portion of these amounts is being accreted over the life of the loan through august off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
the following chart represents our total contractual obligations  including principal and interest  at december   aggregated by type payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years years more than years in thousands note payable leasehold improvement arrangements equipment lease line operating lease obligations patient services obligations for research  development and manufacturing total contractual obligations these amounts represent projected future principal and interest payments to hc royalty based on our current lfrp projections  which are subject to uncertainties based on the timing and amounts of cash receipts under the lfrp
